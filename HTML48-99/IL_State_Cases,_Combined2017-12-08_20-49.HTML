Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 183.1 (1957)) of the Uniform Trust Receipts Act. The issues included whether the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a used car dealer, secretly sold vehicles without paying the finance company that advanced him the credit to purchase the vehicles for his business. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 18.01 (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 183.1 (1957)) of the Uniform Trust Receipts Act and appealed. On review, the court held that testimony of defendant's remarks that he was going to &quot;roll&quot; the financier plus the circumstances of the secret transactions was enough to support the jury's finding of defendant's criminal intent. The jury's verdict, supported by such evidence and based on its assessment of the witnesses' credibility, could not be reversed. Neither was the statute an unconstitutional imprisonment for debt because Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 12 specifically excluded wilful non-payment, and it certainly did not apply to any form of fraudulent conduct. Nor did it violate Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, as the statute did not have to include the passages from its former version that were amended. Moreover, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The prosecutor's improper comments during his closing were successfully objected to at trial and were held to be non-prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant of violating the Uniform Trust Receipts Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was indicted for operating a truck on a tollway that was over the prescribed statutory maximum weight, he filed a motion to quash the indictment.

Stat. ch. 95 1/2 para. 228 (1959), which prescribed weight limitations. He also alleged that various provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. The trial court quashed the indictment. The People appealed. The court reversed, holding that the legislature did not intend to make an exception to the general application of the overweight provisions for tollways. Further, the court concluded that there was nothing in the record to show that the weight limitations in para. 228 were unreasonable. The investigation authorized by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 951/2, para. 229 (1959) was also not unreasonable because it was relevant as to the weight of the vehicle. Finally, the privilege against self-incrimination did not apply to the weighing of vehicles. The weighing of vehicles were not testimonial compulsion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city passed a zoning ordinance, which reclassified the zoning of a parcel of land from residential to business, the property owners filed an action seeking to have the ordinance declared unreasonable and unconstitutional and to enjoin the construction of a shopping center on the parcel. The trial court held that the ordinance was reasonable as it applied to the parcel but imposed additional conditions that were not set forth in the ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the trial court apparently misunderstood its role in a zoning case and incorrectly believed that it bore the ultimate responsibility for determining what zoning regulations should have governed the parcel. Because the trial court committed a fundamental error in its review of the zoning ordinance and because it was not clear whether the trial court upheld the validity of the ordinance, the court remanded for a new trial. Further, because the record did not clearly set forth what transpired before the zoning board with regard to the enactment of the ordinance or whether the procedural requirements were followed, remand on that issue was also necessary.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the question was not one of prospective or retrospective operation but rather one of whether the relator came within the terms of the statute so as to be entitled to invoke the procedure provided therein; (2) the relator did not come within the terms of the statute; (3) only a judgment creditor had the right to file an affidavit and secure the issuance of a summons under the Act, and the holder of an unconfirmed judgment by confession was not a judgment creditor within the Act; and (4) the statute by its terms simply did not permit a wage deduction proceeding based on an unconfirmed judgment by confession, regardless of when the judgment was entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff gas corporation filed an action to condemn a subsurface geological strata under defendant owners' land. The gas corporation sought the land for the purpose of storing gas underground and did not seek the fee-simple title to the property, but only the right to inject and withdraw gas. The Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) directed a verdict awarding just compensation to the owners. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contended that the Gas Storage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 104, para. 104 et seq. (1959), was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, holding that the Act was a complete and independent legislative enactment. The court noted that the Act's application was limited to the acquisition by eminent domain of property rights for underground storage of gas, and such storage projects were for a public purpose. The court also rejected the owners' contention that the trial court erred in setting the proper measure of damages to be used in determining the compensation payable to the owners for impregnating with gas a subsurface strata lying under their land. The court noted that the issue of the measure of damages applicable to the taking of a subsurface geological formation was one of first impression. The court held that the condemnation of an easement for the underground storage of gas was the customary measure of damages for easement acquisition and was based upon the diminution of the fair cash market value of the property burdened by the easement. The court found the owners' theory of value for their property too remote and speculative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed their petition against appellee city. The landowners sought relief from real estate taxes on land that the city had acquired from them by eminent domain. They contended that Ill. Stat. Ann. ch. 120, &sect; 509 was unconstitutional and violated Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 2, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, and U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In February the city filed a petition to condemn land, and in May judgment was entered awarding the landowners just compensation. Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 509 (1959), real property taxes for that year became a lien on the land on January 1, and the county retained the amount of the taxes from the condemnation award. The owners prayed for return of the funds or for pro-ration between them and the city. They alleged that they and the city had intended that the owners would pay no real estate taxes for the year. The city denied the allegation. The trial court dismissed their petition, finding that the owners did not show any agreement as to the taxes and award. On appeal, the landowners claimed that the taxes should have been prorated between them and the city as of the date of the filing of the petition because title passed to the city upon filing of the petition and it was unconstitutional to charge as a lien taxes attributable to a period after that date. The court disagreed and affirmed. Such a scheme could have resulted in long continued enjoyment of the land without payment of taxes. It was not improper to treat annual taxes and the lien therefor as a unit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a car dealership and two of its employees, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed the dealership's complaint against appellees, a state's attorney and related parties, seeking to declare unconstitutional a statute prohibiting the sale of automobiles on Sundays and to enjoin certain public officials charged with its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealership brought suit seeking to invalidate a statute entitled &quot;An Act to prohibit the selling, exchanging or bartering of motor vehicles on Sunday, and providing for the enforcement thereof,&quot; Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 282 (1961). The trial court found the legislation valid and dismissed the case. On appeal, the dealership contended that the statute denied equal protection of the laws in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and constituted special legislation in contravention of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect;22. It argued that the statute arbitrarily singled out one group for a restriction not imposed on the sellers of any other commodity. The court held that when the legislature undertook to single out one class of labor harmless in itself, and condemned that and that alone, it transcended its legitimate powers. The court noted that what the dealership complained of was the discrimination as between the automobile business and all others. That question was distinct from the question of whether or not it was reasonable to prohibit Sunday labor per se. The statute was a special law within the meaning of the Illinois Constitution and was, thus, unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

There were no bidders, so the property was forfeited to the State. Section 272 of the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 753 (1959), provided that any person desiring to purchase property that had been forfeited to the State could apply to the county clerk, who would compute the total amount of all taxes, costs, interest, and printers' fees due, together with forfeiture interest in accordance with a prescribed rate schedule. Upon payment of the amount of the delinquent taxes, the purchaser was entitled to a deed. The purchaser bought the forfeited property for the amount due on the unpaid taxes for 1939 and for the years 1909 through 1938, together with interest, fees, and costs as set forth in &sect; 272. The objector argued that only those who had purchased the property pursuant to an annual tax sale could obtain a deed to the property. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, holding that &sect; 272 provided that property purchased under &sect; 272 was to be treated the same as if it had been sold at a regular public tax sale.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cab companies brought an action against defendants, a city and others, in the Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois) for an injunction, declaratory judgment and other relief seeking to enjoin the enforcement of and to declare unconstitutional two taxicab ordinances passed by the city council. The trial court dismissed the action on defendants' motion and entered its decree. The cab companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Public Vehicle License Commission held hearings and recommended that the city council increase the number of taxicab licenses. The city counsel adopted two ordinances that, in part, increased the number of licenses, established preferences for granting licenses, and restricted the assignability of licenses. The companies claimed the ordinances impaired their contract under prior ordinances and deprived them of property without due process of law. Reversing in part, the court agreed with the companies that provisions restricting assignability to natural persons unreasonably denied equal protection of the laws to corporations because they were eligible to receive licenses in the first instance but not to become either transferors or transferees. The court held that the ordinances expressly recognized the companies' priority rights under prior ordinances and that the hearings did not violate due process because proper notice was given, they were legislative in character, neither the ordinance under which the hearings were held nor the law generally required that testimony be taken under oath, and the right to cross-examination, if such right existed, was not unreasonably withheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and held that provisions in one ordinance that prohibited assignability except that in the case of death or military service a license could be assigned to a natural person unreasonably denied equal protection of the laws to corporations and were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the remainder of that ordinance and the other ordinance were valid.</SPAN></P>

On review, the trucker contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 7-303 (1959) was unconstitutional. The court found that the argument that the subsequent issuance of licenses by the Secretary of State after the accident and after the judgment was rendered in Indiana constituted a waiver was not advanced during the administrative proceedings, or in the complaint for administrative review, and that the trucker was precluded from raising it on appeal. Further, the court found that on no occasion did the trucker or his attorney appear, and the hearing was eventually held in their absence. It was reasoned that in view of the repeated delays and the inconvenience that had been caused by the failure of the trucker or his attorney to appear, the hearing officer was justified in refusing to grant an additional continuance. Additionally, the court found that there was nothing in the record that suggested that the trucker was unable to attend the hearing held two months later.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Illinois Department of Revenue, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois), which held that plaintiff lumber company was entitled to a credit against the department's assessment pursuant to the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. The company's action contested the Department's assessment of taxes based on the company's sales of building materials to real-estate developers or speculative builders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sold building materials to builders. The circuit court held that because the builders intended to sell the homes that they built, their purchase of the materials was for the purpose of resale. Therefore, the sales of building materials were not subject to the Act. The court held that to justify the assessment of a tax pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 440, 441 (1959), two conditions had to be met: (1) the transfer had to be for use or consumption, and (2) it could not be for resale in any form as tangible personal property. Because a home was real property, not personal property, the sale of building materials was subject to the Act. Whether the builder had already sold the home it intended to build was immaterial because it was still real property. The Department relied on the proper test when it held that the sales took the articles of the market, and that although the house was thereafter the subject of a sale, the materials themselves were not resold for a direct and specific consideration. The controlling factor in determining taxability was the purpose for which the materials were bought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the judgment that ordered the issuance of a writ of mandamus requiring the members to adopt an ordinance for an election of officers in the fire department, the members sought review of the decision. Relator firemen contended that the members had a mandatory duty to pass an ordinance providing for the election of officers and to pay over monies received from foreign fire insurance companies. The court held that the legislature could have delegated to the city the power to provide fire protection for the municipality, and make all rules for the management of the fire department. It was reasoned that the power of the city over its fire department was not inherent but a matter of legislative grant. The court found that the administrative powers and duties were properly delegated in accordance with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 38-2 (1959). Thus, the court concluded that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 38-2 was constitutional. It was also held that the city did not waive its right to appropriate tax monies to the pension fund. The court found that the writ of mandamus did not permit the city to exercise its discretion to so appropriate the funds, and it was improperly issued.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged that the application of a multiplier on town real-estate assessments failed to comply with the applicable statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 589.1 (1959).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers' sought to enjoin defendants from collecting and distributing that portion of the general property tax for the year 1959 resulting from the application of a multiplier of 1.2048 placed on all town real-estate assessments. A temporary injunction was issued restraining defendants from disbursing the excess taxes received by reason of the multiplier. Thereafter, defendants' motion to dismiss because the complaint failed to allege grounds for equitable relief or state a cause of action was granted, although the injunction remained pending appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree of the trial court, holding that the taxpayers had not asserted that any special grounds for equitable relief existed, that township tax multipliers were unauthorized generally, that defendants were not the duly constituted taxing officials, or that their property was exempt from taxation. Therefore, the court held that because the issue concerned the exercise of authority by duly constituted taxing officials, rather than the absence of such authority, equitable intervention was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the county treasurer and collector, challenged an order from the County Court of Champaign County (Illinois), which held that a formula rate in &sect; 162a of the Revenue Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 643a. (1947), was the maximum legal tax rate as applied to appellee railroad company's funds. The collector asserted that the formula provision of &sect; 162a of the Act had expired and was later repealed by several amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court held the 1958 tax rate for six different funds were subject to reduction under the formula provision in the 1947 version of &sect; 162a of the Revenue Act. When the collector assessed the taxes without regard to the formula, the rates were deemed excessive. On appeal, the collector claimed that &sect; 162c was temporary and expired, and was thereafter repealed. Further, it alleged that any attempt to revive it in 1957 was unconstitutional. The court looked the effect, if any, the amendments to &sect;&sect; 162a and 162b made subsequent to 1951, had on the 1958 taxes. The court found that the formula provisions were deleted from &sect; 162a in 1955 only because local rates had already been established under &sect; 162b and the formula was no longer needed. Moreover, a reference to the formula in the 1955 and 1957 amendments to &sect; 162b did not revive any part of &sect; 162a by reference. However, in a case, as here, where the taxing authorities failed to take any action prior to an established date in 1951, the statute provided that the maximum tax rate limit for the funds at issue was the rate provided in the 1947 amended version of &sect; 162a.</SPAN></P>

The tipping statute made it a criminal offense to lease a place of public accommodation for the purpose of demanding or accepting tips, in addition to the regular, ordinary and published rates of charge for work performed, materials furnished or service rendered.

After seven days of trial, the master filed a petition asking the chancellor to direct the parties to deposit additional security for master's fees and costs. Defendant heirs made the deposit but plaintiffs refused, saying they had lost confidence in securing a fair and adequate hearing before the master. Plaintiffs then sought, but were refused a hearing before the chancellor and were ordered to pay the deposit. The chancellor dismissed the action when plaintiffs failed to show up at a subsequently set hearing before the master. The court held that the chancellor did not err in ordering the parties to continue to present their evidence to the master. Further, plaintiffs waived their challenge to the constitutionality of Ill.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 342 (1957) because the gaming industry products were for a lawful use under the Johnson Act; and (3) the 1919 Act was unconstitutionally vague and void because it failed to describe the military facilities giving rise to its prohibition against the manufacture or sale of gambling devices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The solicitor was arrested by the village police for soliciting newspaper subscriptions because his failure to register with the department prior to engaging in that activity was violative of the village's ordinance that required such. The solicitor brought a declaratory judgment action against the village where he sought to void the ordinance because it was unconstitutional. The trial court decreed in favor of the solicitor because the village's ordinance was contrary to guarantees of the freedom of speech and freedom of the press in both the Illinois and the United States Constitutions. The court affirmed on appeal, however, its conclusion was based on the finding that the village was without authority to regulate solicitors for newspaper subscriptions pursuant to their interpretation of a provision of the Revised Cities and Villages Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 23-54 (1871), rather than on a constitutional basis. The court held that because the village failed to show how the regulation was reasonably necessary to overcome the judicial construction of para. 23-54 that the village was not conferred the power to regulate newspaper solicitors, the ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A former patient of the hospital filed suit in the town court against the hospital alleging that due to the negligence of the hospital he fell from a bed and suffered the alleged injuries of which he complained. The sole question raised by the motion to transfer from the town court was whether that court had a right to proceed to try a transitory cause of action arising outside the town, when the hospital was neither a resident of nor doing business in the town. After review, the court granted the hospital's petition for a writ of mandamus. The cause of action arose outside of the town, and the hospital neither resided in, nor did business within the town. There was no ambiguity in the language of the venue provisions that would have deprived a litigant of due process. Nor did the venue provisions offend the provisions of Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29, by providing a different venue for town courts than for circuit courts. Therefore, the court issued a writ of mandamus directing the judge to vacate the order denying the hospital's motion for transfer, and to transfer said cause to the county circuit court.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the sale, the vendor received a building permit from the city for the construction of a gas station.

The trial court granted relief to the gas company but taxed costs and master's fees to the gas company. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision below. The court held that because the city had waited over seven months before revoking the permit and the gas company had completed a substantial amount of its construction, the city's delay could be inferred as a ratification of the permit, and thus, the gas company could raise equitable estoppel against the city. The court held that gas company failed to show an abuse of discretion by the trial court in taxing costs master's fees against it, despite the fact that it was the prevailing party, because it failed to show that it did not cause additional or unnecessary costs, or that there were no other considerations justifying the decision.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed that the case was moot; however, it reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with directions.

The circuit court affirmed; however, the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court held that: 1) although the Secretary was permitted to continue to assign the same grounds for denial of renewal as those asserted for revocation in 1957, he was obligated to prove such grounds without reference to the prior proof and hearing, especially where there was a stay order; 2) the denial was based in part upon the 1957 revocation; and 3) the Secretary failed to provide such proof in the form of findings of fact with respect to the charges upon which the revocation was based.

The State alleged that the Assembly members qualified as members while holding positions, such as deputy coroner, deputy bailiff, deputy clerk, and village president, in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an amended complaint and challenged the title of the defendants to their respective offices or positions.

In all instances, the members took leaves of absence from their respective employment. All the members, except the village president did not receive dual retirement benefits while serving in the Assembly. The State argued that the Illinois Constitution forbid one person from being elected and qualifying as a member of the Assembly while holding another office under the authority of the State, and, further, that acceptance of membership in the Assembly constituted a resignation from the prior office. The court found that the members held relatively minor local ministerial positions. Further, the eight members who were deputies and held their positions at the will and pleasure of the appointing authority, did not fall within the purview of &sect; 3.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's attorney filed four complaints in quo warranto which attacked the reorganization of a city's police department, questioned the city's power to establish the board to supervise the police department, challenged the qualifications of the board's administrator, and challenged the city council's authority to abolish the office of commissioner. When the circuit court dismissed the complaints, the state's attorney appealed. The court affirmed. The circuit court was correct in the dismissals. No valid claim was asserted against the city on account of salary for the office of commissioner. When the commissioner resigned, he relinquished all right to the office. The city did not lack the power to establish a police board. The city council could allocate responsibility for city government to officers with powers and duties as it deemed necessary or expedient. The city council could commit a particular segment of the city's government to an individual officer or to a board of officers. The administrator was an employee, and not an officer. He was subordinate to the police board. His actions were subject to its control and direction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council adopted an ordinance that classified a portion of the landowner's property as &quot;specialty shop,&quot; which permitted apartments over stores as the only residence. The remainder of the property was zoned &quot;residential,&quot; which permitted one-family dwellings as the only residential use. The ordinance made no provision for the construction of multi-family dwellings. The landowner, a builder, desired to erect multi-family dwellings on its property and contended that the classification of its property had no bearing on the health, safety, comfort, morals, or welfare and that the highest and best use was for multiple dwellings. The trial court granted the landowner's motion for summary judgment and declared the ordinance unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment because a genuine controversy remained between the parties. To prove the ordinance unconstitutional as applied, it was necessary to prove the character of the neighborhood, the classification of nearby property, and other factors, which were not shown. Further, the landowner failed to set forth the complete ordinance in an affidavit or pleading.</SPAN></P>

Laws pp. 659, 2035, 1558, 1180, 1567, and refused to restrain defendants, the county clerk and other county officers, from disbursement of public funds thereunder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the amendments, which purported to change the assessment dates of real estate for tax purposes, were inconsistent with each other, and, if not, whether they complied with certain constitutional requirements. The trial court found the amendments were valid and the court agreed. The taxpayer argued that the assessment scheme effected by 1959 Ill. Laws pp. 659, 2035, 1558, 1180, 1567 violated the uniformity requirement of Ill. Const. art. IX, and that because they applied only to Cook County, they constituted a local or special law prohibited under Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. The court held: (1) that the uniformity requirement was met; (2) that classification on the basis of population was not objectionable where there was a reasonable basis therefor in view of the object and purposes to be accomplished by the legislation; and (3) that such an act was not local or special merely because it operated in only one place, if that was where the conditions necessary to its operation existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Secretary of State and chief clerk in the driver's license division, appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) that found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, paras. 6-204(b), 6-206(a)2, 6- 209 (1959) of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Law were unconstitutional, enjoined defendants from causing the surrender of plaintiff's driver's license or his arrest, and ordered that a notice suspending his license be annulled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that the suspension of his license by defendants would cause him irreparable damage for which there was no adequate remedy at law, denied that he had been convicted of traffic offenses within 12 months, and claimed that his civil and property rights were invaded under color of an unconstitutional statute, the Illinois Motor Vehicle Law. He sought to have defendants enjoined from causing the surrender of his license and asked that the notice of suspension be revoked. Defendants brought a motion to strike or in the alternative a transfer to a proper venue. The trial court denied the motion and entered a decree for plaintiff. The court reversed and held that in the absence of specific allegations as to the constitutional rights or provisions involved, and under the circumstance that there was no determination on the merits below, defendants were left to speculate as to the constitutional infirmities upon which the complaint was based. In view of this defect in plaintiff's complaint, the motion to strike should have been allowed. The court ruled that there was a presumption of validity in the Act because it came within the scope of police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decree of the circuit court was reversed and the cause was remanded with directions to grant defendants' motion to strike the complaint of plaintiff alleging that the Illinois Motor Vehicle Law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged that the statute pursuant to which the agreements were executed, Ill. Rev.

The trial court granted the relief requested by the complaint and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court reversed and remanded to the trial court, with instructions to dismiss the complaint, holding that the term &quot;detailed property record system&quot; within &sect; 25.16 was not indefinite and empowered the county board to enter into the contracts at issue. Also, the legislature was empowered under Ill. Const. of 1870, art. IX, &sect; 1 to enact &sect; 25.16. Further, the contracts did not infringe upon the duties of the assessor.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 216 of the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev.

The provisions of the statute had been followed, the bid was for the full amount of taxes, interest, and costs, and the taxing districts became the equitable owners with the legal title, subject to redemption, in the county as trustee. The constitutional provision for a two-year redemption period applied only to the actual tax sale and not to subsequent disposition by the county.

The trial court proceeding was held under &sect; 73 of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 73 (1959). The judgment debtor and the agent argued that &sect; 73 was unconstitutional because it did not provide for pleadings, notice to third persons, or hearings. The court transferred the case to the appellate court, finding that it lacked jurisdiction. No freehold was implicated because a trustee held the title to the land trust, and the interests of the judgment debtor and the agent were in personal property. A freehold was also not implicated because this proceeding was only to sell property to satisfy a judgment. Though it was unclear whether the agent was served with an amended citation, he had personally appeared in the trial court and had testified in response to a subpoena. The agent's due process objection in the trial court was not a constitutional attack on &sect; 73.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The technicians sought a declaration that an amendment to &sect; 5a of the Dental Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91, para. 60a (1959), which restricted, inter alia, certain forms of telephone directory advertisements, unconstitutionally abridged their rights to freedom of speech and contract, deprived them of their property without due process of law, and had no reasonable relation to the protection of public health. The trial court found that the amendment was constitutional and dismissed the technicians' complaint for want of equity. The technicians sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the legislature was acting within the proper limits of its police power in adopting the amendment, noting that the amendment was rationally related to the state's valid exercise of its power to prohibit the technicians from offering their services directly to the public. The court noted that the Act, when taken as a whole, allowed the technicians wide latitude in lawfully advertising their services to members of the dental profession and found that the Act did not violate the technicians' rights under either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered an order granting the owners' motion to dismiss the action. On appeal, the court affirmed the order. The court held that (1) while the company was an interstate common carrier subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission, it had no authority under federal law to exercise the power of eminent domain; (2) under &sect; 59 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 63 (1959), the company had no authority to exercise the power of eminent domain independent of state government supervision; (3) the state's authority to control the use of eminent power in interstate utility projects was not preempted by federal law, and (4) by failing to submit the proposed project to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the company did not comply with a valid condition precedent to its right to exercise the power of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The potential applicant contended that the village did not have express authority to limit the number of scavengers within its boundaries and that the village ordinance limiting the number of scavenger licenses to two violated the due process clause of Ill.

The trial court expressly found that the ordinance was constitutional and dismissed the action. In affirming on appeal, the court found that the ordinance did not purport to grant an exclusive license. Moreover, the restriction of scavenger licenses bore a real and reasonable relation to the objects of public health. In addition, the public health problems involved justified the subordination of the individual rights upon which the potential applicant relied.</SPAN></P>

The People appealed directly to the court. The court found that whether the Board was legally constituted or not, the persons acting as Board members were performing Board duties with apparent right under the color of office. The court held that the Board was composed of, at least, de facto officers and that the Board's acts were apparently valid. The court also held that jurisdiction to hear the issues in the instant proceeding resided in the County Court of Peoria County because taxpayers could be heard on the question of the excessive or fraudulent character of their assessments by a tax objection procedure in the county court. Quo warranto was not, however, the proper action in which to determine the issue. Because the Board was legally constituted as a de facto body, the validity of its acts could not properly be questioned or determined in a quo warranto proceeding.</SPAN></P>

There was no vested right in any plaintiff to exemplary, punitive, vindictive, or aggravated damages, and the legislature was free to restrict or deny such damages without denying any constitutional right to them. The statute did not violate Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 by denying certain damages as a basis for recovery, nor did it impair the obligation of contract, because the marriage contract was within the plenary control of the legislature and subject to its power to enact reasonable police regulations for the public welfare.

The issue was whether any such action against the decedent's estate was barred by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 1 (1957).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow was barred from bringing a tort action against her husband while he was alive by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 1 (1957), but the trial court held that the law also barred any such action against the husband's estate after his death. On review the court examined the common law origins of spousal immunity in tort, and the legislative history of the Married Women's Act of 1874, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 1 to 21 (1951). The court concluded that while the legislature had emancipated married women to the point that they could be sued or bring suit in their individual capacities, the legislative had specifically reinstated and preserved the common law doctrine of interspousal immunity from actions in tort. The court held that it naturally followed that if a cause of action could not exist in favor of the wife and against the tort-feasor husband during his life, it could not survive his death. Thus, the action against the decedent's estate was also barred. The court also dismissed the widow's argument that the act was unconstitutional, holding that it could not say that the statute was an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

The city had brought separate actions to collect penalties for an alleged violation of an ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The livery owner claimed that the city's ordinance was unconstitutional. He drew a distinction between livery and taxicab service. He asserted that a livery service was operated on a call basis with fares fixed by agreement in advance, while taxi service indiscriminately carried passengers, either on a call or pick-up en route basis, used cab stands and cruising operations, and charged according to mileage by use of a taximeter. He argued that by classifying as taxicabs all vehicles not having any fixed route or schedule which carried passengers for hire, the ordinance was arbitrary, confiscatory, prohibitory and unreasonable, and denied him equal protection of the law and deprived him of life, liberty and property without due process of law. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the city's ordinance did not deprive the owner of his liberty or property without due process of law and that the ordinance was reasonably calculated to secure the public welfare. The court ruled that the city, in its exercise of its police power, was justified in prescribing the use of meters to secure uniformity of transportation charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters alleged that the officials failed to count as valid votes those ballots marked with a check or the word &quot;yes,&quot; rather than a cross. They further alleged that, if those votes had been counted, the proposed amendment to Ill. Const. art. VI would have been adopted. The trial court found the contest was timely but entered a dismissal because only those ballots marked with a cross were valid. The court affirmed, holding that the requirement for a cross to be used was not violative of the federal or state constitution and that the trial court would have usurped the power of the legislature if it had made valid other ballot markings. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 7 1/2, paras. 1-8 (1957), specially providing for constitutional amendments, was silent as to ballot marking, and thus it was necessary to turn to the Election Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, paras. 1-1 et seq. (1957), which provided for elections generally. Section 17-11 of the Election Code, para. 17-11, specifically provided for marking ballots by making a cross on a question submitted to the vote of the people. Therefore, the court held that the only valid method for marking the ballots was the cross.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee nonprofit hospital service corporation was organized under &sect; 14 of the Non-Profit Hospital Service Plan Act, Ill.

Appellant state director of insurance had found appellee lacked sufficient hospital contracts and entered orders prohibiting appellee from soliciting or issuing new subscriber contracts and forbade replacement of existing subscriber contracts with new or different forms in any county of the state. Appellee filed suit to review appellant's orders under &sect; 407 of the Insurance Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 1019 (1959). The trial court reversed appellant's orders, finding &sect; 14 of the Non-Profit Hospital Service Plan Act unconstitutional. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 14 of the Act was unconstitutional and violative of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 2 in that a comprehensive plan of governmental regulation already existed concerning hospital service plan corporations and that no purpose was served by private controls in &sect; 14.

The court held that the trial court did not usurp the auditor's right to initially exercise executive authority. The trial court properly found that the auditor abused his discretion in taking custody and enjoined further custody. The auditor, in releasing the report of examination to the press, triggered the run on the association, creating the so-called emergency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an injured fireman, the estate of a deceased fireman, and the firemen's wives, brought negligence, wrongful death, and loss of consortium claims against defendant landlord for the negligent maintenance of a building. Plaintiffs appealed the order of the Superior Court of Cook County, Illinois, which dismissed the loss of consortium claim and issued a judgment notwithstanding the plaintiffs' verdicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the trial court's basis for granting the landlord a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, namely that the fire ordinances were not enacted for the protection of firemen. General ordinances designed to protect human life included the protection of firemen because such statutes did not discriminate against any one class of persons. Therefore, violation of such ordinances could be used as proof of negligence by an injured fireman. The fact that the premises were leased did not relieve the landlord from liability because the failure to supervise was a proximate cause of the injury. The court also rejected a common-law rule labeling firemen as &quot;licensees,&quot; because firemen were due as great a duty of care from the landlord as any other individual on the premises for the benefit of the landlord. The court found that consortium rights extended beyond support to include other factors and therefore the claim did not duplicate the fireman's claim. The court also rejected the landlord's demand for a new trial, finding the evidence sufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case, so that the original verdicts, in favor of the fireman and the estate and against the landlord in the negligence and wrongful death case, could be reinstated. The court reversed the order granting summary judgment and dismissing the loss of consortium claim, and remanded the cause for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor's negligence action against defendant school district for injuries sustained as a result of a school bus accident was dismissed in light of the rule that the school district was immune from liability for tort. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate decision that sustained the dismissal of plaintiff's case. The court held that in this case the school district was liable in tort for the negligence of the bus driver and all prior decisions to the contrary were thereby overruled. The court stated that the doctrine of governmental immunity ran directly counter to the basic concept that liability followed negligence and that individuals and corporations were responsible for the negligence of their employees acting in the course of their employment. The court concluded that the basis of the immunity rule, that the sovereign could do no wrong, was unjust, unsupported by any valid reason, and had no rightful place in modern society. As the doctrine was created by the court alone, and in view of the finding that the doctrine was unjust, stare decisis did not require the court to blindly adhere to its prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a savings and loan association, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted appellee insurers summary judgment in the association's suit to recover a premium paid for an insurance policy on its withdrawable share accounts. The trial court held that &sect;&sect; 1-6(b) and 1-10(j) of the Illinois Savings and Loan Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, paras. 706(b) and 710(j) (1957), were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policy insured the association's withdrawable share accounts. When the association cancelled the policy, the insurers refused to cancel or return the unearned premium. The association sued, claiming that under &sect;&sect; 1-6(b) and 1-10(j) it had no power to contract with the insurers; thus, it was entitled to a refund. The insurers argued that if the sections prohibited the purchase of the policy, they were unconstitutional. The trial court held that the sections were unconstitutional because they deprived the insurers of property without due process of law. On appeal, the court affirmed. The sections allowed a savings and loan association to buy insurance only from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or federally chartered corporations. The sections were not reasonably connected with the protection of owners of withdrawable share accounts and they invalidly designated federal organizations as a favored class without any reasonable basis for the discrimination against insurers authorized to do business in Illinois. The premium paid was a minimum deposit premium; thus, the association was not entitled to a refund in view of the unconstitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners claimed that the Sunday Closing ordinance was invalid because it was an undue interference with their business activities. The village claimed that the ordinance was valid because it assured that there was no interference with the rights of people to attend church. When the owners argued that such a claim did not apply to other businesses, the village sought to distinguish the validity of the ordinance as it applied to certain businesses. The court held that the ordinance was invalid. The court reasoned that the ordinance had to be valid as applied to all businesses to be proper. Because the reason for the ordinance did not apply to all types of businesses, the ordinance could not have been valid only to some businesses. Additionally, because the purpose of the ordinance was essentially religious, it was invalid because the attempt to ensure that the people attended church instead of having attended business was beyond the police powers of the village. Therefore, the ordinance was beyond the power of the village to enact because the businesses did not interfere with attendance at church and did not disturb the peace.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the assignee's redemption action was null and void because it was not made within the time required under &sect; 20, amended 1957, of the Act relating to judgments, decrees, and executions, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 77, para. 20 (1957). The assignee contended that his redemption action was timely because &sect; 20 provided for redemption within 15 months after the foreclosure sale under its provisions that were in effect on December 4, 1953, the date that the mortgage was executed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly found the assignee's attempted redemption was null and void because the 1957 amendment to &sect; 20, reducing the redemption period to 12 months, was procedural and had to be applied to all foreclosure sales that occurred subsequent to its effective date.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 95 1/2, paras. 3-201 to 3-210 (1957), upon which the decision of the trial court was based. The court found that it was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the constitutionality of the Law had not been raised and addressed in the trial court. The court found the record totally devoid of any showing that the validity of the statute in question was either raised or ruled upon in the trial court. Moreover, its validity was not contested on appeal. Rather, each of the parties relied upon the security provisions of the Motor Vehicle Law and contended that violation by the other was what permitted the double financing to be accomplished.

The committee rejected his application to practice law on grounds that he failed to prove good character and moral fitness. The bar applicant contended that the committee abused its discretion and exceeded its function when it inquired into his political views. The supreme court affirmed the committee's decision, concluding that the bar applicant, by failing to respond to the higher public interest, obstructed the proper functions of the committee, and that by his own recalcitrance he failed to demonstrate the good moral character and general fitness to practice law necessary for admission to the bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint in equity against defendant, later deceased, for a partnership accounting. Defendant filed a countercomplaint for dissolution of the partnership on the ground of fraud, and an accounting. In 1954, the trial court entered a decree for plaintiff dismissing the countercomplaint and referring the cause to a master. On the basis of the master's report, the trial court in 1956 ordered defendant to pay plaintiff $ 7387.90. The appellate court held that because the 1954 decree had adjudicated fewer than all the issues, &sect; 50(2) of the Illinois Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 50(2) (1959) made that decree reviewable on appeal from the 1956 decree even though para. 50(2) became effective more than a year after the 1954 decree was entered, then ruled that defendant was entitled to relief on her countercomplaint. The court dismissed plaintiff's appeal, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction where the appellate court's judgment, as distinguished from its opinion, did not draw into question the validity of para. 50(2), or raise other constitutional issues, because the appealable character of the 1954 was established by &sect; 74(1) of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed that, while he was putting a roof on a shed for his employer, he came into contact with an improperly insulated electric supply line owned by the utility. On the utility's motion, the trial court ruled that the complaint was defective because it failed to allege that the employer was guilty of negligence and the proper remedy was provided by &sect; 5(b) (Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 48, para. 172.40 (1957)) of the Workmen's Compensation Act. On appeal, the court held that the complaint was sufficient to withstand the utility's motion. It alleged that, during the course of their employment, the utility's employees knew that plaintiff would be working close to the power lines and knew or should have known that the power lines were not properly insulated and would be a source of danger to those working nearby. The utility was engaged in the hazardous enterprise of distributing electrical energy, an enterprise that required a high degree of care. Any relevant limitation upon the utility employees' authority to cut off the power or to report what they had seen was an issue properly for discovery and trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 24-1. The court affirmed the conviction. The court found that counsel for defendant was afforded full opportunity to examine prospective jurors pursuant to Rule 24-1. His failure to avail himself of the privilege served only to emphasize the fact that the examination conducted by the trial court was thorough enough to reveal any facts necessary to show grounds of challenge for cause. Defendant made no contention that the jury finally selected was not fair and impartial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while working on a defective tank car owned by the company. He brought a personal injury action against the company and obtained a jury verdict in his favor. The company challenged the verdict to re-examine the effect of the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1913 (WCA) upon a common law action for negligence brought by an employee injured in the course of his employment by someone other than his employer. The company first argued that the employee failed to prove the company's negligence and failed to prove his own lack of contributory negligence. The court found sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's verdict because the jury could have found that the company negligently failed to make a proper inspection of the car before returning it to the employee's work station. The company next argued recovery under common law negligence was precluded by &sect; 6 of the WCA, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 143 (1949) and &sect; 29 of the WCA, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 166 (1949). The court found the railroad company was not the employee's employer or a fellow employee, so the action was not precluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a township library board, sought to enjoin defendants, township collector and clerk, from paying over to defendant cities the proceeds of the township library taxes collected on property within the cities, and to declare &sect;&sect; 1 and 10 of the Library Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 81, paras. 1, 10 (1957), unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) entered a decree for the cities, and the library board filed a direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A township levied a tax for a township library. In 1955, &sect;&sect; 1 and 10 of the Library Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 81, paras. 1, 10 (1957), were enacted, and provided that if a city located within the township also levied such a tax for a library the township was to pay the amount of tax it collected on property within the city over to the city for its library. The city was then required to abate its library tax levy by the same amount. The court upheld the constitutionality of the amendments, holding that to invalidate the tax, the uniformity requirement of the constitution would have to have been construed to apply not only to the levy and assessment of the tax, but also to the disposition of the tax after collection. The court concluded that the 1955 amendments which provided for the equal levy and assessment of a library tax upon all taxable property within the township did not offend the constitutional requirements of uniformity. The court could not say that the maintenance of a city library conveniently accessible to all residents of the city, who constituted a substantial portion of the residents of a township, did not directly promote the general welfare of the township.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the 1955 amendments to the Library Act were within the constitutional power of the legislature, and that the tax authorized was uniform in its levy and assessment and was levied for a proper corporate purpose of the township. The decree of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The charges against the attorney arose out of his participation in zoning matters as an attorney for private interests while occupying the position of city alderman. Much of the alleged misconduct arose as a result of the attorney's referral of a large amount of law business to a close friend who assisted the attorney in his successful campaign for alderman. The court accepted the recommendation of the commissioners and censured the attorney, holding that the attorney's representation of a client before the local zoning board of appeals conflicted with his duties as an alderman and tended to bring the legal profession into disrepute because he undertook legal employment that presented a conflict of interests between his duty as an advocate for his client and his obligation to his governmental unit as an alderman. The court noted that the attorney's reputation was good, and that he was not guilty of conduct warranting disbarment or suspension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against the director, seeking to compel him to institute proceedings under the Eminent Domain Act to ascertain damages to the landowner's property. The damage was allegedly caused by certain changes in a highway. The writ was issued, prompting this appeal. The appeal was directly to this court on the ground that a construction of the constitution was involved. The director argued that none of the landowner's land was taken and, therefore, it was error to require him to file an eminent domain proceeding for the ascertainment of damage. The court found the petition for a writ of mandamus was an acceptable method for the landowner to seek relief. However, the pleadings raised factual issues that were not resolved regarding whether the construction on the highway caused the landowner's alleged damage. That question needed to be resolved in the landowner's favor before the director could be compelled to institute condemnation proceedings, the only purpose of which was to determine the amount to be awarded as damages. It was error to issue the writ on the landowner's pleadings without resolving the damage issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank filed an application with a public accounts auditor for permission to change its location. After a hearing, the auditor granted the bank permission to move to a location that happened to be in proximity to the competitor. The competitor petitioned for a trial de novo of the bank's application, alleging that the move would have an adverse effect upon its business. The trial court granted the motions of the auditor and the bank to dismiss the competitor's complaint, on the grounds that the statute purporting to grant the right of trial de novo was unconstitutional, and that in any event the competitor lacked standing to bring a proceeding thereunder. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the determination of an appropriate location for a savings and loan association, and factors to be considered in such matters, were executive, so could not be performed by courts through the medium of trials de novo. The court reasoned that the statute authorized courts to make determinations, the nature of which fell outside the class to which judicial processes were limited, in violation of separation-of-powers principles.</SPAN></P>

Intervenor citizens challenged technical irregularities in the conduct of the election approving issuance of the bonds. The Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) issued the writ of mandamus, and the township clerk and citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The multi-precinct township held a special election to authorize the issuance of bonds, but voting was held only in one location, rather than in each precinct established in the township. On appeal from an order granting the writ of mandamus, the court held that the judgment order was not void nor was it erroneously rendered because the issuing judge signed the formal order in another county before transmitting it to the clerk for entry. In reversing the writ of mandamus, the court held that it was improper to hold the election at just one location. The great number of people who resided within the township could not vote at a single polling place if all, or substantially all, of the electors chose to exercise their right to vote upon the public question. That situation defeated the basic concept of a free and equal election. Further, because part of the township was located within a city with a board of election commissioners, that board was required to supervise the election within the city boundaries.</SPAN></P>

The bus company was properly before the court without service of summons because it made no special appearance to contest service. Its substitution was proper under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 54(1) (1957). An amendment increasing the complaint's ad damnum related back to the original complaint under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 46(4) because the bus company's express assumption of the trustee's liabilities and obligations under the bankruptcy court's consummation order amounted to an acceptance of service of process on the trustee as service on the bus company's agent. The amendment of the ad damnum was not error because it was no more than an additional claim for damages.

Approximately one month later, the zoning ordinance was amended to prohibit the future construction of any dwelling units in districts other than those designated as dwelling districts. In the mandamus action, the village pleaded the amended zoning ordinance as an affirmative defense. The trial court ordered the village to issue the permits for the construction. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in holding that the builder had acquired a vested right under the prior zoning ordinance that entitled it to complete the construction of the town houses.</SPAN></P>

The renter, a master for one of his employer's ships, was a resident of Alabama. The employer was a foreign corporation not licensed to do business in Illinois, but maintaining an office in Chicago, where it solicited business, employed Illinois residents, and sold tickets. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court order dismissing the writ of garnishment for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court found sufficient contacts to subject the employer to Illinois jurisdiction. However, the court found that the wages sought were exempt from attachment under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 62, para. 62 (1957), which precluded jurisdiction when the wages were &quot;payable out of this state.&quot; The court found this statute did not violate Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the decree of adoption, the court held that the burden of showing the notice statute to be unconstitutional was upon the natural parents who raised the issue, and they had not met that burden.

The mother had surrendered the child to a licensed child welfare agency, waived notice, and consented to adoption, and the alleged father had no rights in the proceeding, as previously determined. The motion to dismiss included only issues which were res judicata, or general constitutional questions, presented by parties who had no statutory or constitutional right to intervene in the proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed a complaint against the Illinois company for an injunction. The complaint alleged that the Illinois company owned certain property in violation of a zoning ordinance.

The trial court issued a decree that found that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void. The trial court also denied the county's prayer for an injunction. On appeal, the court noted that the mere fact that the property might have been worth more for the more intensive use did not invalidate the ordinance. The court further noted that the Illinois company's use of the property was not a permitted use, and the fact that the use was not offensive or detrimental was of no consequence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cemetery operators appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which dismissed their complaint against defendant State of Illinois. The complaint alleged that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, paras. 73.101-73.108 (1955) (Act), which provided that money paid for the final disposition of a dead human body was a trust fund was unconstitutional. The trial court continued a temporary injunction pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cemetery operators owned cemeteries in Illinois and were members of a management company that performed accounting services. The cemetery operators contracted for the sale of burial vaults, memorials or markers, and services in connection with graves. The contracts for merchandise and services provided for delivery and performance when items were fully paid for upon request. There was no performance until full payment was made. In over 95 percent of the cases, payments were made in installments, extending over 3 years. In case of default in an installment payments for more than 30 days, the cemetery operator had the right to declare the agreement void and retain the payments as liquidated damages. The Act invalidated such installment agreements and provided that any money provided to a cemetery operator to dispose of human remains was a trust fund and that the cemetery operator was a trustee of the funds, who had to deposit the funds into an account. The court held that the Act was constitutional in that it did not violate due process provisions. The court likened the installment contracts to insurance contracts and held that the Act was a proper use of police power.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; 3 (1870) gave the legislature the power to exempt from all taxation any and all property used for cemetery purposes. The court held that it was a proper purpose of the cemetery association to provide for perpetual care or trust funds with which to maintain the cemetery grounds, so that the property was tax exempt even though not being used for burial purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 2 did not contravene the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., because the McGuire Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45, had resolved the conflict between the Sherman Act and the non-signer provisions of the Fair Trade Act by recognizing the rights of states to authorize agreements prescribing minimum or stipulated prices for the resale of commodities in interstate commerce and to extend the prices prescribed by such agreements to non-parties to the agreements. Reenactment of the Fair Trade Act subsequent to the McGuire Act was unnecessary. The remedy of injunction to prevent unfair competition was proper. The court found that the retailers obtained from the fair trade agreements the liquors which they sold and other benefits in the nature of the substantial benefits of price support, freedom from unfair competition in the sale of trademarked merchandise, and prompt notice of changes in minimum resale prices which occurred as a result of a competitive economy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administratrix instituted suit against defendant railroad in the Illinois court for the death of her husband, allegedly through the negligence of defendant. Defendant obtained a temporary injunction in Cass County, Michigan, where plaintiff resided, restraining plaintiff from prosecuting her Illinois action. The court held that the Michigan injunction was in everything but form an order restraining the Illinois court and determining the cases it may properly try. The court stated that it need not, and would not, countenance having its right to try cases, of which it has proper jurisdiction, determined by the courts of other states, through their injunctive process. The court held that it was not only free to disregard such out-of-state injunctions, and to adjudicate the merits of the pending action, but could protect its jurisdiction from such usurpation by the issuance of a counterinjunction restraining the enforcement of the out-of-state injunction. The court held that it was reversible error for the trial court to dismiss plaintiff's supplemental complaint and her motion for a counterinjunction, and reversed the judgment of the appellate court affirming it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and entered an order dissolving the village. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that under the doctrine of legislative supremacy, the village was prohibited from asserting the protections of the due process clause. Further, the provision of &sect; 7-49.1 that the federal census was conclusive evidence of population did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers. It was the practice of the court's to take judicial notice of the federal census, and additionally, it was reasonable and was based on sound public policy. The court also found that &sect; 7-49.1 did not violate Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. The classification of municipal corporations with a population of less than 50 bore a direct and reasonable relation to the ineffectiveness of such small municipal corporations as agents of the state and constituted a reasonable basis for their dissolution.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly concluded that the exemption provisions were invalid. The court found that the classification in the exemption provisions was not reasonable and was in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22; and Ill. Const. art.

The court held that the trial court erred in restraining the officials from enforcing &sect; 121.02 because the invalidity of the exemption provisions did not render the entire section invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, and held that the treasurer could not be deprived of his discretionary power by the courts. Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority Act &sect; 12, Ill. Rev.

The provisions of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20 prohibiting the state from loaning its credit had no application to the contemplated purchase. The legislature did not, in Deposit of State Moneys Act &sect; 22 1/2, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 130, para. 41a (1957), restrict the state's investment power to unappropriated state moneys, and the fact that there would be insufficient money in the treasury to make the purchase from unappropriated funds did not violate the statute. The court found no unauthorized or unconstitutional action on the part of the authority. The lease from the city park district to the authority of submerged lands was not invalid.

The trial court confirmed the superintendent's order that called for the election. The court dismissed the appeal, determining that the objectants could not raise issues on appeal that were not raised in the administrative proceedings. The record was insufficient to give the court jurisdiction on the ground that a constitutional question was involved because the trial court did not rule on the constitutionality of &sect;&sect; 8 -- 9 of the School Code of 1955. The constitutional question was moot because the legislature had removed repugnant tax rates by combining the sections into one act as Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 8 -- 9 (1957). The appeal was improvidently allowed in view of the absence of any constitutional question and the failure of the record to reflect that any error was raised or preserved before the superintendent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed the provisions of the Sentence and Parole Act and concluded that it required juvenile offenders under the age of 17 to be committed to the Illinois Youth Commission. The term of that commitment would be the maximum sentence they could have received for the crime. This provision of the law did not render the sentence indefinite because the maximum sentence was imposed even thought the Youth Commission had the discretion to release them sooner. If the Youth Commission determined to incarcerate defendants it could do so. If defendants reached majority while still incarcerated, there were provisions for transferring them to the penitentiary to complete the term.

The court said that there was a reasonable basis for the legislation which did not require its extension to cities and park districts having a population of less than 500,000. In the light of the objectives sought to be attained, the court held that the legislative classification by population was based upon a rational difference in situation or condition found to exist between the municipalities of the state. The court determined that the enactment was a general law based upon a reasonable classification by population, and, as such, it was immaterial whether it affected certain of the powers of the city.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found in favor of defendant sanitary district and held that the amendments to &sect; 9 of &quot;An Act to create sanitary districts and to remove obstructions in the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers,&quot; Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 42, para. 328 (1957), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State objected to the sanitary district borrowing money for corporate purposes and issuing bonds. The trial court held that the district, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 42, para. 328 (1957) had the power to borrow money for corporate purposes, and issue bonds therefore, but could not, inter alia, become indebted in an amount exceeding five per centum of the valuation of the taxable property within the district. On review, the court affirmed. The two amendatory acts to the above statute did not violate any constitutional provisions. They were valid and operative statutes, and the bonds issued pursuant to their provisions were likewise valid obligations. The district could establish a corporate working cash fund and a construction working cash fund by the issuance of bonds without referendum because the statute allowing it was constitutional. Working cash funds were approved as a proper method of municipal finance. The assessment of taxes to establish and maintain such fund was &quot;needful&quot; as providing a method for current financing of corporate expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holding in favor of the sanitary district and the constitutionality of the Act challenged by the State.</SPAN></P>

By order of the Director of the Department of Public Safety, he was transferred to the State Penitentiary. The statute authorizing such transfer, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 118, para. 15 (1957), was constitutional. It did not violate Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 8, because the right to a grand jury could be abolished by the legislature in cases of transfer. It did not violate the constitutional prohibition that one branch of government could not exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, because the Director was not exercising a judicial function. Indeed, the legislature had full authority to provide prisons and to determine where to send prisoners and the courts had no discretion as to the place to which criminals might be committed except as the legislature prescribed. Further, because the difference between the various institutions in the penal system was no longer a difference in the degree of discomfort imposed upon prisoners but rather a difference in the security or treatment needed for particular individuals, transfer of individuals was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad company in 1923 had paid its license fee based upon authorized capital and upon stock actually issued. It amended its articles of incorporation in 1956 to reduce the number of preferred shares and increased the common shares, but the total authorized capital stock remained the same. The stated capital was increased when the preferred stock was redeemed. The court reversed, finding that the present statute enacted in 1933, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 157.128 (1955), required the payment of a license fee at the time of filing the first report of issuance of shares and an additional fee was required whenever additional shares were issued, or an increase was reported in stated capital without the issuance of shares. The court found that the railroad company's argument that the paid-in surplus should haven been excluded in computing the license fee was contrary to the plain language of the statute had to be rejected because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 157.129 (1955) proscribed as the basis for an additional license fee the amount of increase in the sum of the stated capital and paid-in surplus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company transported automobiles by truck. Prior to 1952 the company had filed for Illinois licenses for its trucks, not to exceed the gross weight of 24,000 pounds. In 1951, the General Assembly amended the Motor Vehicle Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 9 (1951)) establishing license fees and classifications by weight, for trucks operating upon Illinois highways. The Secretary of State instructed the company that it could only apply for the classification of 24,000 to 41,000 pounds established by the old act. The company paid the necessary additional fees prescribed in the amendment for trucks of 24,000 to 30,000 pounds. The Secretary contended that such payment was insufficient. The court found that the company filed the application for license plates for trucks from 24,000 to 41,000 pounds because the Secretary refused to file any other. It was necessary for the company to file such application in order to obtain license plates and to avoid statutory penalties. Therefore, the filing of the application and payment were made under duress and compulsion and were not voluntary. The court concluded that the company made payment of all sums due and owed nothing more.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 67 1/2, para. 63 et seq. (1955).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The validity of the Act was challenged on the grounds that it was a taking of private property for other than a public use, constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power, and was vague, indefinite, and uncertain in its terms. The commission could make no sale until it had prepared and approved a development plan for the area that was approved by the state housing board. If the commission in five years had not sold the property, the property would be sold for cash to the highest bidder. The court held that the elimination of the blighted vacant area was itself a public purpose regardless of the type of redevelopment thereafter. No community could exist for residential purposes only. To determine the best or proper purpose to which land unfit for residential use may be put required expert and reasoned attention and determination. The court held that the Act did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority and power to the commission. The words used in the Act were of common usage. The court held that the use of words, which were commonly understood, when taken in conjunction with the context, did not render the Act invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city denial plaintiff license applicants a license to operate a nursing home. The applicants filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for a declaratory judgment that the frontage-consent provisions of Chicago, Ill., Code &sect; 136-6 (code) were invalid. The trial court held the code invalid as applied to the license applicants. Direct appeal was taken to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The code provided that no license to operate a nursing home in a residential area would issue without the consent of a majority of the area's residents. The license applicants sought to establish a nursing home in an area zoned &quot;apartment house&quot; district. The court held that the city's application of the ordinance deprived the license applicants of their property without due process of law. If an ordinance permitted lot owners to impose restrictions on others' property by use of consent provisions such limitations were an invalid delegation of legislative power, but a consent provision that merely waived or modified a valid legislative restriction was permissible. Thus, the code was a valid provision. However, no rational basis existed to bar the nursing home from the apartment house district. Such districts were zoned to allow hotels and boarding houses. There was no legislative finding that the proposed use was a nuisance or would have worked an injury to public health or safety. The city's general zoning plan declared a nursing home appropriate for apartment-house-use district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, in the license applicants' challenge to a zoning ordinance, affirmed the trial court's ruling that the ordinance regarding zoning of nursing homes was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

Since the death of the mother, the operator occupied the property as a rooming house. The village, under the authority of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 23-87.1 (1957), had the express authority to license, locate, and regulate the use and construction of rooming houses. The operator contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was unreasonable and arbitrary when applied to the operator's property. She argued that the village could not pass an ordinance that affected existing established property rights. The court held that the statute on which the ordinance was based was a valid exercise of police power and applied to the existing rooming house, even though the building in which it was located antedated the enactment of the statute. It held that the ordinance was presumptively valid and that the operator failed to meet the burden of showing its invalidity.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the verdict and held that there was a long history of interpretation that the Scaffold Act was not superseded by the Workmen's Compensation Act, and that it was not vague and indefinite so as to violate due process and improperly to delegate legislative authority to those who were charged with its administration. The court held that the owner of the property and every contractor and sub-contractor were equally bound by the act to comply with its provisions, and in case of willful failure were liable to the party injured for any direct damages sustained by reason of such failure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land at issue was a tract of about 10 acres in an unincorporated area classified as a farming district. The desired use of the land as a trailer park was not a permissible use. The property owner did not file a formal application before the zoning board of appeals because its secretary stated it would be useless because the board of county commissioners had issued an oral directive not to rezone any more property for trailer park use. The county claimed that the property owner had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court reversed, finding that where it was alleged that a statute was valid on its face, but was applied in a discriminatory or arbitrary manner, resort to the appropriate administrative board was required. Pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, para. 152i et seq., the county had created a board of appeals with authority to vary the zoning regulations in cases where they resulted in practical difficulties and particular hardship on the owner. The court found that the necessity of making application before the board was not dispensed with because the application may have been denied. Thus, the property owner had a remedy before the zoning board of appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1953, the Illinois legislature amended its fireworks statutes to limit the distribution and sale of sparklers. Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 276.1 - 26 (1957) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 276.27 - 31 (1957), the sale of sparklers was limited to those who had been issued permits by local governments to conduct public fireworks displays. The sparkler company filed a complaint seeking a ruling that the statutes were unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the sparkler company sought review. On appeal, the court found that sparklers did fall within the definition of fireworks and that the legislature had restricted their sale to reduce injuries to children. The court determined that the legislature's objective was a proper one and the means used to achieve it were reasonable. The court upheld the statutory amendments as proper exercises of the legislative power to act in the interest of public safety.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that it could not be said that the procedure provided by the amendatory act put an unreasonable hazard upon an owner to deprive him of just compensation; therefore, due process was not violated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff was injured when he fell from a ladder while climbing to a scaffold located on a construction site for the railroad.

The employee also argued that the doctrines of assumed risk and the fellow-servant rule that were considered in the Workmen's Compensation Act did not apply to his action. Finally, the employee argued that if the two statutes were read together, the Scaffold Act violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and was invalid as special legislation under Ill.

Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.5 (1957) were given its natural scope because the employee still had an action against the railroad and the absence of precise symmetry caused by the legislative determination to treat separately and specially the rights of employee and employer did not result in unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Just west of the owners' property, on property likewise zoned for single-family residences, the city constructed a water tower, pumping station, and weighing station.

In so ruling, the court noted that the clearly showed that the ordinance substantially diminished the value of the owners' property. Indeed, there had been no offers to buy even at the lowest value placed upon the property for residential purposes. Further, the record was almost devoid of evidence from which it was reasonable to infer that there would be any substantial gain to the public if the residential classification were maintained.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each petition alleged that the children did not have proper parental care and that the parents were unable to care for, protect, train, educate, control and discipline the children. The mother moved to dismiss the petitions, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional in numerous respects. The court found that the parents were unable to care for the children. The question was whether the relief granted deprived the mother of a constitutional right. The court stated that the mother's motion to dismiss admitted the allegations of the petitions. The contentions of the mother on appeal concerned provisions of the statute and interpretations thereof as abstract propositions. No attempt was made to show how the proceedings, under the authority of the statute, had deprived her of some right. The court declined to discuss the constitutionality of a provision of an act where the party urging its invalidity was not in any way aggrieved by its operation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff promisee sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of De Kalb County (Illinois), which denied defendant promisor's motion to dismiss the amended complaint for the cause relating to a breach of the promise to marry, but dismissed the entire rest of the cause including the claims relating to actual damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The promisee filed a claim against the promisor on three counts alleging a breach of the promise to marry, mental anguish and injury, compensatory damages, along with aggravated, punitive, and exemplary damages. Promisee moved to dismiss promisor's motion to strike, contending that the sections of the statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 83, pars. 25 through 34 (1955), relating to breach of promise to marry, were unconstitutional under the state constitution. The court denied promisor's motion to dismiss count I of promisee's amended complaint, and dismissed counts II and III. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the statute did not take away the cause of action for breach of promise or the right to the damages, but it denied a right to aggravated or exemplary damages for a seduction and pregnancy by reason of his agreement to marry. The court held that the counts relating to the alleged seduction, the ensuing pregnancy, and the damages arising were stricken. The statute had limited the damages recoverable to actual damages, and because punitive damages could not be recovered, the statute was not in contravention of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's striking of counts relating to the promisor's alleged seduction, the ensuing pregnancy, and the damages arising therefrom, and found that the promisee had waived any right to a finding of error in that the trial court should have stricken only those portions that contained improper elements of exemplary and aggravated damages, rather than dismiss all of count III.</SPAN></P>

Thereupon the village brought their appeal directly to the court, the constitutionality of a statute being involved. The only issue left to be tried at the hearing had been the number of electors in the area to be disconnected, and whether a majority of them signed the petition. The issues presented on this appeal were whether para. 7, &sect; 39 was unconstitutional, and whether the landowners proved that a majority of the electors residing in the area signed the petition. The village contended that the landowners failed to prove that a majority of &quot;electors&quot; residing in the area sought to be disconnected signed the petition. The court held that the legislature had differentiated between an elector and a registered voter. The landowners proved that 16 of a possible 18 &quot;electors&quot; did sign the petition. Thus a majority of the electors, proved to reside in the district, signed the petition, and all niceties of proof necessary to the allowance of the petition for disconnection were met. The court found no merit to the constitutional argument pressed by the village.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner sought direct appeal of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Whiteside County (Illinois), which ruled that a dwelling owned by the owner was used for prostitution and constituted a public nuisance under the provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 100 1/2 (1955). The circuit court enjoined the owner from maintaining such a house and directed a sale of all fixtures and movable property in the house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court denied a motion to vacate the decree and the owner filed a direct appeal. On review the court found that the record showed no basis for a direct appeal. The answer merely disputed the facts alleged in the complaint and presented no question of the statute's validity. The court noted that to confer jurisdiction by direct appeal a constitutional question had to be presented to the trial court. The general charge of unconstitutionality did not constitute the presentation of a constitutional question. Where a statute was charged to be unconstitutional, the objection had to be specific and complete in order to fully present the matter to the trial court. A mere assertion that an act was unconstitutional was not sufficient to clothe the court with jurisdiction upon a direct appeal. Moreover, the right to question the validity of a statute might be waived by a participation in litigation that by fair inference acknowledged the statute to be valid. Because the owner denied that the house was used for prostitution she participated in forming a factual issue under the provisions of the statute and she acknowledged the validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the nonprofit corporation, there were two boards of directors and two sets of by-laws, one elected by the members and the other created by the board of directors. In determining which was the valid board of directors and which was the valid set of bylaws, the court found that (1) there was neither a constitutional right for members to vote for directors, nor a constitutional prohibition of the staggered election of directors because nonprofit corporations were not governed by the constitutional mandate of Ill. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3; (2) the action was governed by the General Not for Profit Corporation Act of 1944; (3) the board of directors alone had the power to amend the bylaws at all times and the right to amend the bylaws to provide for a self-perpetuating directorate; and (4) the members entered into the contract with the reserved power to amend the bylaws outstanding in the corporation and this power was validly exercised by the board of directors. The court concluded that the amendments to the bylaws, which were adopted by the directors, were valid and subsisting.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sold food to the federal government, some of which was served in military mess halls and some of which was sold in post exchanges to service personnel and authorized civilians. The company filed a complaint for an injunction against the state officials seeking relief from the retailers' occupation tax on food sales to the government. The trial court granted the officials' motion to strike the complaint and dismissed the action for want of equity when the company elected to stand by its complaint. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court agreed that the food sold for use in enlisted mess halls was subject to the tax because enlisted personnel did not pay for their food. Thus, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 (1955) the food was transferred to a purchaser for use or consumption, which constituted a retail sale under para. 441. However, the court ruled that food sold to serve in officers' mess halls or to resell in post exchanges was not subject to the tax because pursuant to para. 440 such food was resold for valuable consideration. Thus, there was no retail sale of the food. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The property owner challenged the validity of the county's zoning ordinance as depriving it of its property without due process of law, as a taking of property for public use without just compensation, and as denying equal protection of the laws. The circuit court found that the county's zoning ordinance ignored the intermixed character of the neighborhood, the surrounding uses, the traffic situation, and the highest and best use of the property and that there would be little gain to the public by limiting the use to residential purposes and a great financial loss to the property owner. The county appealed. The court held that the circuit court's findings and judgment were supported by the evidence and affirmed, holding that (1) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 75(1)(a) (1955) authorized direct appeals in all cases in which a construction of the constitution was involved; and (2) the ordinance failed, and its presumption of validity was dissipated, because there was no reasonable basis of public welfare that required the zoning limitation and the resulting loss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners owned buildings improved with the same type of elevators, a power freight elevator that traveled upward and downward in a shaft or hoistway. The elevators were periodically inspected by the city and were found to comply with existing ordinances. The city then enacted and retrospectively applied an ordinance that required powered elevators to be equipped with hatchway door interlocks. Despite the city's amendment of the ordinance, the trial court held that the retrospective application of the ordinance was an improper exercise of the police power. The court disagreed and found that the issue of an arbitrary classification between elevators became moot with the amended ordinance. The court reversed the judgment because the owner of property acquired no immunity against the exercise of the police power because he constructed it in full compliance with the existing laws. The court held that while regulations restricting the use of property did not ordinarily have retroactive effect, municipal corporations in the exercise of their police power could, within reasonable bounds, enact ordinances or regulations having such effect.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the words &quot;approximate the fair, cash market value&quot; of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 440-6 (1953) were vague, inexact, incapable of legal definition as applied to a given situation. The also contended that the statute under which the Commission sought to have the deed set aside was special legislation. Defendant claimed that the statute was punitive and penal in nature and scope, but lacked the safeguards required of such legislation. The court concluded that the statute was not subject to the constitutional objections urged. The challenged terms were not inadequate. Tax provisions commonly used such terms, which had frequently been interpreted and upheld as proper standards of measurement. The statute was not unconstitutional &quot;special legislation.&quot; By its terms, the statute was applicable to all recipients who transferred real property under the conditions set forth.

Rev. Stat. chap. 95 1/2, para. 218b (1955). The driver filed a direct appeal challenging the constitutionality of the statute, which required the installation of specified splash guards on second division vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a law was passed requiring the installation of specified splashguards on second division vehicles (trucks), the driver was fined for failure to install the proper equipment. In upholding the constitutionality of the statute, the court held that if the means were appropriate, the ultimate aim of safeguarding life, health, and property upon the highways was clearly within the power of the Illinois General Assembly. The legislature could properly enact such a law even though it might have interfered with the property of an individual, the overriding consideration being that the safety of the people was paramount to the unfettered use by an individual of his property. The requirements and specifications for the splashguards were intelligible and ascertainable, and the standards for their implementation were fully spelled out. The classification requiring the guards only on second division vehicles was reasonable and based on substantial differences which had a rational relation to the subject matter. The court took judicial notice of the difference between vehicles of the first and those of the second division so far as the need for splashguards was concerned.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers appealed on grounds that the appropriation in question violated the Illinois Constitution. The court affirmed the decree of dismissal, and held that there was no constitutional violation. The court determined that the construction and maintenance of a television station was well within the powers of the university without any additional statutory enactment upon the subject. The appropriation of state funds for the television station was valid. The statute, which appropriated funds in a lump sum, did not violate the itemization provisions of Ill. Const. art. V, &sect; 16, even though it failed to specify the object or purpose for which the appropriations were made, and was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power in violation of Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city sought to acquire the assets of the private water utility, the utility obtained an injunction against the condemnation. In reversing the injunction, the court stated that the situation was exceptional and that the value of all waterworks property, including that necessarily added subsequent to the date the condemnation petition was filed, had to be determined in an eminent domain proceeding. Because of the circumstances, the ordinary rules of valuation also had to change so as to put the utility in as good a financial condition after the transfer as it was before. Nothing short of such an amount conformed to the constitutional requirement of just compensation. While the purpose of the utility was public in its nature, it could not be said to be strictly identical with the municipal purpose. The city was a public and governmental agency, holding property for the general benefit, with a larger scope of use, so that its taking of the property of the utility by eminent domain was proper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings and entered a declaratory judgment granting the relief prayed, and defendant department. The court held that the legislature was not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious in determining that the nature of plaintiff's business was such as to render it hazardous and dangerous to the public safety and security, warranting police regulations.

The court ruled that both beneficiaries were older than 15 when the decedent married their father. The court ruled that evidence of the decedent's involvement in the beneficiaries' lives prior to their turning 15 was insufficient to establish that she stood in the acknowledged relation of a parent to the beneficiaries. There was no evidence that the decedent assumed any significant duties of parenthood before the beneficiaries became 15. The court ruled that the requirement that the relationship must have commenced before the child's 15 birthday was not arbitrary.

Stat. ch. 67 1/2, paras. 63-91 (1953), defendants, builders and others, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which overruled their traverse to plaintiff land clearance commission's condemnation petition and denied their motion to vacate the judgment and dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission determined that the area was a &quot;blighted vacant area&quot; under &sect; 14, and the city council and the State Housing Board approved the determination. In a previous action, a quo warranto proceeding, a court upheld the commission's power to proceed under the act and the act itself against claims of unconstitutionality. In this action, the trial court overruled defendants' traverse to the petition. On appeal, they contended that the commission's finding that the area was a blighted vacant area was fatally defective because it was based on a finding that tax delinquencies exceeded the &quot;assessed value&quot; of the land, instead of its &quot;fair value.&quot; The court disagreed and affirmed. Neither the commission's determination, the city ordinance approving it, nor the State Housing Board resolution approving it, contained any reference to the assessed value of the land. Moreover, a finding that taxes or special assessment delinquencies exceeded the fair value of the land was not essential to the determination. Also, due to the quo warranto proceeding, the four-delay delay between the commission's approval of the redevelopment plan and the condemnation petition was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

Seventeen years later, the incompetent filed a petition to remove the bank as successor conservator and contended that the probate court's order appointing a conservator was unconstitutional. The probate court dismissed the incompetent's petition. The circuit court also dismissed the petition on appeal. On review of an alleged constitutional question, the court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that there was no showing that the probate court interpreted or applied Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 86, para. 53 (1937) to only physical incompetency. The court also ruled that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 86, para. 53 (1937) was constitutionally valid. The court ruled that the evidence in the probate court was contrary to a finding of physical incompetence. The incompetent lived 14 years in an institution for the feeble minded, and both of the trial judges expressed doubt as to her present mental ability to handle her own affairs. There was no evidence of any physical disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state's attorney challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which upheld the constitutionality of the Public Building Commission Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34. Thereafter, the circuit court granted the motion to strike brought by defendant public building commission boards and dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's attorney contended that revenue bonds issued by a building commission became general obligation bonds of the municipality entering into leases with a commission and that the municipality was constitutionally required to levy and collect taxes for their payment. The commissions argued that such leases did not create a constitutional indebtedness for the lessee municipalities. The court affirmed dismissal of the action, holding that: (1) the bond obligations were to be paid solely from the revenues and income derived from the leased public property; (2) a municipality's obligation under a lease of public buildings from a commission was not an indebtedness within the proscriptions of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 12; (3) the lessee municipality was not obligated to repay the bonds issued by a commission; (4) the commissions and the municipalities were separate and distinct entities, each exercising separate and distinct functions, and nothing warranted a finding that one corporate body was but a shadow of the other; and (5) municipalities had no control over the commissions or over the exercise of any of the essential governmental and public functions given to the commissions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's findings to reflect that leases executed by a municipality with a public building commission did not create a municipal indebtedness prohibited by the Illinois constitution. The court affirmed the judgment that the Public Building Commission was constitutional and the dismissal of the state's attorney's action.</SPAN></P>

The resident later brought the automobile into the state of Illinois.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident and amici curiae raised numerous other constitutional objections to the use tax. The most fundamental contention was that the Illinois constitution prohibited the passage of any general use tax. The resident also argued that the tax was not a franchise or occupational tax, and that it could not be sustained as a property tax because it was not levied on an ad valorem basis, or as a privilege tax because it did not involve conduct over which the general assembly had a special power of control. The circuit court dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed the decree of the circuit court. In so ruling the court determined that the general assembly was not without power to enact a use tax and that constitutionally, the legislature could shape the use tax that it imposed to conform to the tax upon retailers. The court further concluded that the act was not fatally vague and indefinite.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's decree that dismissed the resident's complaint and sustained the validity of the Use Tax Act.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para 1-15, for the damages awarded in a prior suit against one of the city's police officers who, while off duty, shot and blinded appellee injured party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party first obtained a judgment against the police officer for injuries resulting from a shooting; and, in the instant suit, the injured party then obtained a summary judgment against the city for indemnification under &sect; 1-15 of the Revised Cities and Villages Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 1-15. The city questioned the constitutionality of &sect; 1-15 and its liability thereunder. The court reversed the summary judgment, holding that &sect; 1-15 created an obligation for the city to indemnify its officers from liability resulting from an injury caused by a policeman, who was performing his duties when the injury was inflicted, if the injury did not result from the officer's willful misconduct. The court found the judgment in the first suit was res judicata as to the issue of the officer's act, but it did not determine whether the officer shot the injured party while &quot;on duty&quot; or whether there was willful misconduct by the officer. These were questions of fact, which required remand and further proceedings in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interrogatories requested the names and addresses of all persons who were occurrence witnesses and the names and addresses of all persons who witnessed the victim's injured condition after the accident until he was removed to the hospital. The transit authority argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para 58 (1955), which provided that a party shall not be required to furnish the names or addresses of his witnesses, and excused it from complying with the interrogatories. The transit authority also argued that Ill. R. Civ. P. 19-11 and Ill. R. Civ. P. 19-4 were invalid to the extent that they were inconsistent with the statute. The court noted that the statute protected a party from being compelled to identify the witnesses he intended to use at trial, that is, witnesses in the technical sense, but did not preclude discovery regarding occurrence witnesses, or persons that had knowledge of relevant facts. The court rejected the transit authority's argument that the information was protected because it was work product and was mad by or by the transit authority in preparation for trial, noting that it was not applicable to the facts and affirmed the decision of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's ruling that the transit authority was guilty of contempt for refusing to answer the interrogatories because the information sought was not protected work product and the witnesses were occurrence witnesses who had knowledge of the relevant facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners applied to a board of appeals for a variance to use the land for a gasoline service station. Their request was denied, and they sued for injunction. The circuit court granted the injunction. On appeal, the court reversed. The circuit court had jurisdiction because the board of appeals record was not before it, and it did not purport to review the board's decision. The circuit court proceeding was not one to &quot;review&quot; the board's decision; rather, it was called upon to exercise its traditional role of determining the constitutionality of legislation. The overwhelming weight of the evidence established the reasonableness of a residential classification, The character of the neighborhood was residential, and heavy traffic on an adjoining street was insufficient to establish the unreasonableness of the classification. Even though the property would have had a much greater value if used as a service station, neighboring residential properties would have substantially declined in value if a service station were operated on the property. There was room for fair difference of opinion on the classification's reasonableness, and the city's legislative judgment was respected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a foreign corporation engaged exclusively in interstate commerce activities within the state. It owned and operated three pipeline systems and pumping stations that transversed the state. The secretary of state assessed an increased license fee and franchise tax against the taxpayer. The taxpayer paid the tax and fee under protest and filed the instant action for a refund, which the circuit court dismissed. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court erred in dismissing the suit. The Business Corporation Act imposed franchise taxes on foreign corporations authorized to do business in Illinois under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 157.138 (1955) and imposed license fees on foreign corporations under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 157.135. The taxpayer argued that it did not transact local or intrastate business and was thus not liable for the assessments. However, the court held that the state could tax the privilege of carrying on intrastate business within reasonable limits by applying the tax rate to a fair proportion of the taxpayer's business done within the state.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered judgment for the Board, and the teachers appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the school district was a political unit separate and apart from the city, which was exempt from the statute; (2) the teachers' had failed to demonstrate a deprivation of life, liberty, or property that was required to invoke the Due Process Clause; (3) a state could validly provide that a person who was knowingly a member of an organization which advocated the overthrow of constitutional government by unlawful means was not eligible for public employment; (4) the affidavit was a proper means for the state to determine fitness for employment; and (5) the Act was not a bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 73.1 et seq. (1955), was unconstitutional. The Director sought review. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that: (1) the provision of the statute that required a funeral director to be a registered embalmer was pivotal; (2) its validity depended on the intervention of the funeral director with the embalmer, and upon the degree both were related to the public health and welfare; (3) embalming prevented the spread of communicable diseases, and the public interest, and public health considerations, justified the regulation of the handling of dead bodies; and (4) the record did not establish that a funeral director be a licensed embalmer, and the trial court was correct in holding that that provision violated Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 92 of the Criminal Code, under which he was convicted and sentenced, was unconstitutional in that it failed to provide for like punishment for the same or similar offenses in violation of Ill.

Defendant also argued that &sect; 92 was not meant to apply to a convict who aided a fellow convict escape. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the statute was constitutional and that, by its terms, it applied to anyone guilty of the proscribed conduct. The legislature acted within its authority in imposing a more serious offense for aiding a prisoner escape than aiding a burglar or robber, and the punishment reflected the greater danger to society resulting from the escape of a prisoner who might have serious criminal propensities. Hence, although that resulted in severity of punishment in some cases, it did not constitute an unreasonable classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband brought an action against his wife seeking a divorce, and the wife filed a counterclaim. Thereafter, the trial court denied the wife's request for a jury trial, granted the husband's divorce, and dismissed the wife's counterclaim. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the wife waived her right to a jury trial under &sect; 7 the Illinois Divorce Act of 1874, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 8 (1953), and &sect;&sect; 1, 64(1) of the Illinois Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, paras. 125, 188(1) (1953), by failing to demand a jury trial when she filed her appearance. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the wife's jury demand because it was filed four years after she entered her appearance. The court determined that no special circumstances existed warranting the conveyance of the husband's property to the wife and that the evidence supported the trial court's findings regarding the wife's alcoholism. Finally, the court held that under the circumstances, the wife was entitled to alimony, as well as payment of costs and attorney fees pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 16 (1955).</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the authority was a municipal corporation and the legislature had the power to authorize it to enact such ordinances, rules, and regulations as were necessary for its operation and to enforce them with proper sanctions.

The property owners alleged that the amendments to the zoning ordinance were unconstitutional, illegal, and invalid. The court affirmed the trial court. It rejected the property owners' contention that judgment on the pleadings was not proper because the allegations of the complaint established that the ordinance failed to comply with the substantive requirements of the enabling act. The allegations of the complaint did not indicate in what manner the proposed use was dissimilar to presently permitted uses under the zoning ordinance. Although the property owners had a right to rely upon the classification of property and that classifications would not be changed unless required for the public good, they also acquired their property knowing amendments could be made to the ordinance within the limits of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners bought a house because it contained two flats. They moved into one and hoped to rent the other but then discovered that the property was restricted to single-family occupancy under the County ordinance. The area in which the property was located was classified as a &quot;farming&quot; district. The County's board of commissioners upheld a decision by the board of zoning appeals denying a petition to change the classification. The court overturned the judgment that granted declaratory relief. The County's expert had testified at trial that the area was for single-family dwelling and that the only way the County could restrict the density of occupancy in areas with inadequate public facilities was by establishing such zones. The property owners presented no evidence showing the extent to which the restriction impaired the value of their property. Moreover, there was only meager evidence by which to compare their hardship against the public gain. Thus, the court concluded that they failed to show by clear and affirmative evidence that the ordinance, as applied to their property, was arbitrary or without substantial relation to public health and safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property was zoned residential, and the owners wished to devote the property to light industrial uses. The property was adjoined by residential property to the east and north, but was adjoined by light industrial and railroad property to the south and west. The owners stressed the proximity to the industrial areas and the undesirability of residences near a railroad switching yard. The Village emphasized the extensive residential development and that the only access to the property was through the residential area. The court found that there were factors that favored both sides. The court held that because there was room for differing opinions regarding the reasonableness of the ordinance, it was required to respect the legislative judgment of the Village. A residential classification was not precluded simply because the property touched industrially zoned areas. The owners' argument that the residential classification was imposed upon them without notice and hearing as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, paras. 73-2 and 73-8 (1955) was rejected. An ordinance that was specifically made applicable to the property was passed after proper notice and a public hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant zoning board of appeals granted a variation to defendant bank from the setback provisions of a zoning ordinance. Plaintiff, the owner of property in the same zoning district, filed a complaint under the Administrative Review Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 264 et seq. (1955), seeking to reverse the board's decision. The Superior Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the complaint, and plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The variation allowed the bank to construct a building up to the front line of the lot instead of 11 feet back from the front line as required by the zoning ordinance. Plaintiff owned property 184 feet west of the bank's property. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the board's decision. The right to review a final administrative decision was limited to those parties of record in the proceeding before the administrative agency whose rights, privileges, or duties were affected by the decision. Plaintiff had no right to challenge the board's decision because plaintiff failed to show that it was injured or damaged by the decision. Allowing the variance did not adversely affect plaintiff's building. The mere fact that the two properties were in the same zoning district did not give plaintiff standing to maintain the action.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that &sect; 5(a) was not unconstitutional because if co-employees were permitted to bring common law claims it would engender a staggering amount of litigation and would tend to disrupt harmonious relations between workers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the property owner received a permit to build a service station on its property, the city passed a driveway ordinance requiring the owner to obtain a permit before building any driveway in or across any public walk, curb, or parkway. The court affirmed the circuit court's declaratory judgment in favor of the owner and found that the ordinance was invalid because it did not impose any restrictions or standards on the city council's absolute discretion to deny permission to build or maintain driveways. Moreover, the driveway ordinance was invalid because the city did not show how that ordinance was necessary to facilitate the exercise of a power delegated to the city by the state legislature. In finding that the ordinance was not authorized by statute or by the Illinois Constitution, the court found that the ordinance not only failed to spell out any reasonable standards that the property owner was required to meet as a condition precedent to acquiring a driveway permit, it also purported to authorize the outright denial of a permit in any situation, depending upon the city council's will.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance required the installation of curbs and gutters along proposed streets of subdivisions.

They argued that the requirements set forth in the ordinance were unnecessary under the circumstances and that they created an unreasonable burden upon them without any relationship to the public, safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare. The trial court enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance's provisions against the landowners. The trial court declared the ordinance to be arbitrary, discriminatory, unreasonable, and void. The trial court's judgment was reversed on appeal.

The taxpayer filed objections to the application of the county collector for judgment fixing the correct amount of real estate taxes paid by the taxpayer. The taxpayer claimed that it was entitled to a refund because: the improvement assessed on the property leased by the taxpayer was owned by the lessor, the board of education; the improvement was on school fund property and thus not taxable regardless of the use to which it was put; and the taxpayer owned only a leasehold in the improvement, which had no taxable value. The trial court overruled the taxpayer's objections and denied the taxpayer a refund. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) the mere fact that the property was owned by the board of education was insufficient to support a claim of exemption; and (2) the taxing officials had the authority to levy the tax objected to in the manner they did and such tax did not result in an unconstitutional perversion of school funds or grants.</SPAN></P>

The agriculture department and others (department) filed a motion to strike the complaint and dismiss the action, which the trial court granted. The association appealed, and the court affirmed. The court rejected all of the grounds on which the association attacked the amendment's constitutionality. First, the court stated that the new provisions of the act had a natural and logical connection to the retained provisions, which were conceded to have been conditions on the expenditure of public funds, and thus, were within the scope of the act's title. Second, the words used in the act were not vague, indefinite, or uncertain. Third, the delegation to the agriculture department was constitutional.

The court determined that the property owner failed to show that the city was prompted by arbitrary or discriminatory considerations or that the zoning limitations that were employed were unrelated to the public good. The zoning ordinance did not contravene any provisions of the State or Federal Constitutions because there was no showing that the boundary lines between the use districts were drawn in a manner that discriminated against any particular persons or property.

Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 7e (1955). Because the constitutional validity of a statute was involved, the court had jurisdiction on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife filed an action in mandamus to compel the clerk to file her complaint for divorce despite her refusal to comply with the statute. The circuit court denied her request, and the wife appealed. She argued that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and found that the statute provided immediate access to the courts by a procedural means applicable alike to all litigants and that a postjurisdictional delay of 60 days was not unreasonable. The court also found that the legislature, mindful of the state's interest in maintaining the integrity of the marriage relation, did not act arbitrarily or unreasonably in requiring that a divorce complainant wait at least 60 days before making the charges a matter of public record and having a hearing thereon. The court held that the authority of the circuit court to exercise judicial discretion in determining whether the immediate filing of the complaint was warranted or necessary satisfied due process of law, and since all divorce litigants were subject to its provisions, it was not special legislation violative of Ill.

The circuit court allowed the employer's motion to dismiss on the ground that &sect; 5(a) of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.5 (1951), barred the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in the course of his employment, although he was not permanently disabled from working. In addition to filing suit against the employer under &sect; 8(e) of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.8 (1951), for the loss of use of his testicles, the employee filed a negligence suit. The employer moved to dismiss, claiming Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.5 (1951) barred the suit. The court affirmed the grant of such motion, holding &sect; 5(a) of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.5 (1951), barred the suit. The court held the employee's injury was sustained during the course of employment and the injury was compensable under the Act, which covered not just the loss of the testicles but also their permanent and complete loss of use. The court further held that even if the injury was not covered by &sect; 8(e), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.8 (1951), &sect; 5(a), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.5 (1951) still barred the action. Finally, the court held the Act was not unconstitutional in that it required the employer to give up certain defenses and required the employee to give up certain recoverable elements of damages of a common-law negligence action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the indictment was not fatally defective. The court carefully examined the indictment and found that it clearly stated the offense in the terms and language of the applicable statute and specifically alleged that the money was given to a duly qualified and acting weighmaster of the city, with intent to influence and cause him to act with favor and partiality toward the defendant in the execution of his official duties as weighmaster of the city by recording false weight upon goods bought by the defendant.

Because the property owners' lot was smaller than one-fifth of an acre, they alleged that the zoning law rendered their property worthless. However, no proof was offered to show the property's value. In addition, the property owners did not show that the ordinance had no reasonable relationship to legitimate objects of the police power: the health, safety, and welfare of the town's citizens.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gas company sought to restrain the enforcement of a city ordinance that imposed a tax on persons selling gas and electricity for use in the limits. The ordinance also provided the electric company with a credit against the tax in an amount equal to its street use payments, which resulted in the electric company paying only an added one percent tax, while imposing a five percent tax on the gas company. The circuit court dismissed the gas company's complaint and the court affirmed. Even though electricity and gas were both forms of energy, the two occupations were not identical and their differences allowed them to be classified separately. Although the gas company once provided energy for lighting purposes, the gas light era had passed and lighting was done almost exclusively by electricity and, at the time the ordinance was enacted, the gas company was engaged almost entirely in the sale of natural gas for fuel purposes. Finally, there were basic differences in the means by which the two products were produced, distributed, and used and so many factors involved in determining their respective market positions as to negate the absolute necessity for a single classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor, as a taxpayer and citizen, questioned the validity of a deed of the city that conveyed certain real estate to the corporation. The real estate was originally conveyed to the city as a gift for public purposes. The city conveyed the land to the corporation, who was the high bidder. The mayor objected to the transaction and contended that the authority conferred upon the municipality under the Revised Cities and Villages Act, Ill. Comp. Stat. 24/59-1, 59-2 (1953), was unconstitutional if it permitted the sale of land dedicated to public uses to a private corporation. The court held that the legislature did not have the power to permit diversion of an express trust created by the grant of the settlor. The settlor's deed clearly indicated a general charitable purpose for the benefit of the public. Under the doctrine of cy pres, the proceeds from the sale of the land must be applied to a charitable purpose. Thus, the court remanded for further determination of whether the proceeds were applied for city purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the wife of a deceased worker (wife), instituted an action against defendant railway company. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered a judgment on behalf of the wife. The railway company sought an arrest of judgment, judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), or a new trial. The railway company's motions were denied, and the railway company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railway company appealed the wife's judgment, arguing that it was not negligent and that the admission of the actuary's calculations of the projected pecuniary loss was in error. On appeal the court held that the wife was able to recover under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 51-59, because there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude the railway company was negligent and that the negligence was the proximate cause of the accident that killed the worker. The actuary was not allowed to testify that the wife was deprived of a specific amount of monthly contribution for a certain amount of time. However, on cross-examination it was made clear that the actuary did not mean for the jury to adopt her figures. The jury assessed damages fairly, after they heard and considered the evidence. Thus, the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence the testimony tending to prove the deceased worker's earning capacity. The wife did not have to prove the value of the financial loss of the care given by the deceased worker, any more than it would have been necessary to prove the value of pain and suffering. The jury's assessment of the value was not in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which denied the railway company's motions for an arrest of judgment, a JNOV, or a new trial. The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which entered judgment in behalf of the wife.</SPAN></P>

Also, the litigants contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 11 18.1 and 4B 25 (1953) were unconstitutional because they delegated legislative power in violation of Ill. Const. art. III. The court held that the legislature could give an administrative body discretionary powers to decide an issue if it established standards under which the discretion could be exercised. The court found that the statutes were constitutional because they were as definite as could be formulated without being too rigid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Paragraphs 8 and 9 of &sect; 5 of the Dentist Practice Act made it unlawful for dental laboratory technicians to take impressions for false teeth, or to make or repair them, except when engaged or employed to do so by a licensed dentist. Section 5a of the Act prohibited technicians from selling their products directly to the user or prospective user, even though a licensed dentist was otherwise involved. The trial court found &sect; 5a unconstitutional. The court reversed, holding that the statute was reasonably related to a legitimate end, being the protection of the public and dental profession. In so ruling, the court noted that the knowledge and skill of the dentist was necessary with respect to prosthetic dentures. However, due to persistent and blatant advertising, the control of dental patronage had come into the hands of technicians who had directed it to such dentists as they saw fit. Prohibition of direct dealing between the technicians and the public was, thus, desirable to avoid the danger that the profession of dentistry might become subservient to the business of those engaged in the making of plates. The advertising by a specific technician should have been enjoined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order insofar at it permitted the technicians to sell directly to the public and insofar as it permitted one of the technicians to advertise and in all other resects the order was affirmed. The matter was remanded with directions to proceed in conformity with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court had previously ruled that amendments to the Act that increased license and registration fees and privilege tax imposed upon owners of motor vehicles of the second class was unconstitutional. While the state's appeal of that ruling was pending, the vehicle owner applied for certificates and license plates at the lower rate provided by the Act before its amendment. When the court held that the amendatory act was constitutional, the secretary filed suit in the circuit court to require the vehicle owner to pay the difference in fees. On appeal, the court held that venue was proper in Sangamon County, noting that every step taken by the plaintiff in acting upon defendant's application occurred there. The court found that the secretary had express statutory authority to collect the fees and privilege taxes in question. The court further noted that the vehicle owner was bound by the class suit brought to challenge the amendments, and could not, therefore, retain any advantage obtained by the erroneous decree of the circuit court, for reversal left the case as though no such decree had ever been entered. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 158 -- 1 to 158 -- 8, (1955) violated Ill. Const. art IV, &sect; 6, 7, 8 and that the reapportionment was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen alleged that the Reapportionment Act of 1955 violated the state Constitution because the senatorial districts on their face violated the constitutional mandate that they had to be formed of contiguous and compact territory and that area was to be the prime consideration in their formation. The citizen alleged that the districts were not compact and that they are not equal in area. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to determine whether the legislature achieved the nearest approximation to compactness, it could only determine whether the legislature applied the appropriate principals. The court noted that the record did not show the existing political, natural, and artificial boundaries within the city and that it did not have judicial knowledge of such matters. Nor was there any evidence to indicate that the legislature gave prime consideration to population, ethnic groups or the preservation of political sinecures rather than area. Further, the legislature was presumed to have acted correctly. Because there was no evidence to rebut that presumption, the court held that the act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county authority owned housing projects within the city's limits. It refused to meet with the city authority to discuss the transfer of its assets. The State Housing Board directed the county authority to transfer its assets to the city authority, but the county authority did not transfer all of the assets. The city authority sought a writ of mandamus to compel the county authority to transfer its assets. The lower court issued the writ, and the court affirmed. The court held that the Housing Authorities Act (Act) required the successor city authority to take over not only all county authority property within its territorial limits but also all county authority obligations. It was the legislature's intent that funds attributable to any project within the city would pass to the city authority with the property. A directive from the Public Housing Administration to the county authority was within its jurisdiction and clearly spelled out the procedure by which all property was to be turned over to the city authority.

After the other first adoptive parent died in 1952, a similar finding was entered by the probate court. The alleged heir filed objections to the probate court's 1952 finding and appealed to the trial court, which ruled that the readoption of the alleged heir did not alter the alleged heir's right to inherit from his first adoptive parents. After the blood relatives appealed the trial court's decision, the appellate court reversed the trial court's ruling. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. The court held that (1) the alleged heir's contention that the readoption decree was void upon its face was without merit, as no issue to the validity of the Wisconsin decree was presented in the lower courts; and that (2) the alleged heir's readoption by his natural parents destroyed any relationships created by the first adoption, including the right to inherit.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a decree that perpetually enjoined the lot owners from further violations of the ordinance and retained jurisdiction for the purpose of assessing attorney's fees and costs.

On appeal, the court focused its attention on the subsequent decree because it found that no timely appeal was taken from the original decree. The court affirmed the allowance of the attorney's fees. The court held: (1) the 1953 amendment to the zoning law was constitutional because the legislature was authorized to impose sanctions that it considered appropriate; (2) the provision for attorney's fees did not create special privileges and immunities; (3) the lot owners did not have a right to a jury trial as to attorney's fees because the awarding of fees was within the purview of the trial court; and (4) the fact that the amendment embraced more than one subject posed no constitutional violation because the intent was to enlarge the class of plaintiffs and increase allowable costs.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the trial court's decision was reversed and remanded with directions. The court found that while the parties argued the case on constitutional grounds, the determinative issue was whether, on the allegations of her complaint, plaintiff complied with the statutory notice requirement.

On appeal, the court found that the taxpayer properly sought injunctive relief to prevent a wasteful expenditure of substantial public funds in holding an election under an unconstitutional statute. The court also found that para. 117 was so inconsistent and unworkable that it left town officers in confusion. If para. 117 was valid, there was no present board in existence competent to act under the prevailing township law because prior to the statute, the justices of the peace, town clerk, and supervisor, and no less than three, could act as a board of auditors. Paragraph 117 violated the separation of powers principle by stating that justices of the peace, appointed by judges, continued their membership in the board of auditors until their successors were elected and qualified. The statute made no provision for the justices of peace not so appointed to continue as members of the board of auditors.</SPAN></P>

She sought to enjoin the county from extending a tax levy to a detached territory in its refunding bond resolution and a declaration that Ill. Rev.

On appeal, the resident claimed that the court erred in dismissing her complaint and in not declaring that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 11-13-1 contravened Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9. The court found that the bonds issued by the board did not create additional indebtedness and that the board acted validly as a state agency, pursuant to Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, to refund an existing bond debt and provide for its liquidation. The court found that the new levy for the refunding bonds merely continued a prior levy for the funding and refunding bonds that was still a subsisting debt upon the detached territory. Thus, the constitutional prohibition against taxation of territory beyond municipality boundaries did not apply. The effect of refunding the debt was only to alter the form of the obligation and not to create a new one. Hence, the resident had no right under Ill. Const. art.

On direct appeal the heirs argued that the mortgagee wrongfully sold the property without properly notifying them. The court found that it had no jurisdiction over the matter because the constitutionality of the Civil Practice Act was not raised in the trial court and therefore was not an issue on appeal.

The court dismissed the appeal, holding that because the case was wrongfully appealed to it, the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 110, paras. 210 and 259.47 (1953), required that it be transferred to an appellate court. Furthermore, when no useful purpose was served by transferring the case, it was proper for the court to dismiss the appeal. Finally, because there was no constitutional question pending and the owner's complaints went to the correctness of the circuit court's decree there was no useful purpose to be served by transferring the case.</SPAN></P>

The grantee argued that the county court erred in ordering the reconveyance of mineral estates to the former owners under the Reconveyance Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 736-738 (1951).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former owners possessed mineral rights, including oil and gas, underlying land conveyed by tax deeds to the grantee. The former owners filed an action to recover possession under the provisions of the Act requiring a grantee to take possession land within one year of conveyance. The county court ordered reconveyance. The grantee appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the Act was applicable to mineral interests. Under the Act the grantee was required to take actual possession of his mineral interests or to bring an action in reliance on the superiority of his title. Under the tax deeds, the grantee took title subject to the statutory redemption rights of the former owners. Therefore, because the grantee had not taken possession of his interests as provided in the Act, the former owners were able to divest the grantee of title. The Act did not violate Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 or the due process clause because the class of freehold mineral estates were uniformly treated. In buying mineral estates, the grantee was presumed to know the provisions of the Act, and the fact that compliance with the provisions of the Act was difficult did not excuse his lack of compliance.</SPAN></P>

Thus, under the circumstances, the court could not say that the ordinance as applied was unconstitutional. Specifically, the court held that in challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance and seeking equitable relief against its enforcement, the owners and the lessees assumed the burden of proving that, as applied to their property, the law was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and bore no substantial relation to the public health, safety, comfort or general welfare.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were whether appellee city had authority generally to enact a so-called Sunday closing ordinance, and whether, as applied to the automobile dealers, the ordinance in question was a reasonable exercise of that authority. The court held that Sunday ordinances had to be based on a reasonable classification, and an ordinance prohibiting the sale of a commodity was not discriminatory against particular dealers who were accorded the same treatment as all other dealers in the commodity. Municipalities could classify businesses for legislative purposes, as long as the classification rested on a reasonable basis and the legislation was applied uniformly to all members of the same class. The court held that the exceptions allowed in the ordinance did not appear unreasonable, and each could certainly be distinguished from the sale of new and used automobiles. The court held that the city had demonstrated that it had the authority to enact the ordinance involved, that the ordinance as applied to the automobile dealers was a reasonable exercise of its police power, and that it did not violate any constitutional guarantees of the automobile dealers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees anticipated the possibility of sale of two abandoned school sites and filed actions to have declared invalid, under the Reverter Act, any possibilities of reverter that might exist by reason of the deeds under which the school sites had originally been acquired. The trial court rejected the master's recommendation that title be quieted in the school districts and held that the Reverter Act was unconstitutional. The trustees appealed, and the court reversed. Each deed had provided that in the event the land ceased to be used as a school, the land would revert to the tract from which it was taken. The court found that the statute reflected the General Assembly's appraisal of the actual economic significance of reversionary interests, weighed against the inconvenience and expense caused by their continued existence for unlimited periods of time without regard to altered circumstances. The court held that the time period allowed under &sect; 5 of the Reverter Act was reasonable and afforded adequate opportunity for the heirs to enforce rights which had vested prior to the statute's enactment.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to try one defendant as a habitual criminal pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 602 (1953). According to the court, the indictment contained a count specifically charging one defendant with having previously been convicted of burglary. The court noted that the fact of such prior conviction was established by stipulation. The court also found that the trial court properly instructed the jury. According to the court, the language of the given instructions did not tend to force a verdict. Finally, the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions. According to the court, there was a sufficient positive identification of defendants as the perpetrators of the crime to support the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the 1951 and 1953 amendments to the Motor Vehicle Law were unconstitutional because they levied a tax upon the privilege of using the highways for interstate commerce which was in excess of a fair contribution for such use, levied confiscatory taxes that rendered operation of a business upon the highways impossible, and they did not bear a reasonable relation to the use made of highways. Plaintiffs also contended that the 1953 act unconstitutionally discriminated between owners of similar vehicles and unreasonably discriminated between persons similarly situated with regard to reciprocal arrangements between the states. On appeal, the court found that its earlier decisions were conclusive as to the issues concerning the 1951 amendment, but there were several issues pertaining to the 1953 amendment that had not been considered by the court. Plaintiffs' attack on the validity of the 1953 amendatory act on the theories that it levied confiscatory taxes and that it bore no reasonable relation to the use made of the highways because it was not proportional to the mileage traveled were not valid attacks or objections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Franklin County (Illinois), which found that a municipal ordinance prohibiting the drilling and operating of oil wells within a certain vicinity to protect the public water supply was unconstitutional. The circuit court dismissed the city's complaint that sought to enjoin defendant petroleum company owners from drilling for oil near the municipal water system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance that declared property around a lake as a drainage area and prohibited oil and gas operations to protect the public water supply. The owners had oil and gas holdings within the designated drainage area. The city sought an injunction to prevent the owners from drilling, alleging a threatened pollution of the water supply. The circuit court found the municipal ordinance unconstitutional and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the city's police power delegated by the legislature. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 75-3 (1953) gave the city express statutory authority to prevent or to punish any pollution or injury to its public water supply 10 miles beyond its corporate limits and regulatory jurisdiction was implicit in the statutory grant. The city's ordinance was not an unreasonable exercise of its police power, nor did it deprive the owners of due process of law. There was evidence that the salt water discharge from the exploratory operations could contaminate the water supply. A valid exercise of police power that precluded the most profitable use was not a &quot;taking&quot; of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and remanded with directions to overrule the owners' motion to dismiss, to reinstate the temporary injunction, and to proceed with a hearing on the merits of the city's complaint.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer claimed that the taxes levied for the corporate fund of the District was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District had appropriated money from its corporate fund levy of taxes for each fiscal year. One part of one year's appropriation had not provided an amount for loss and cost, but the District levied taxes for that amount anyway. The taxpayers challenged the method by which the District would levy taxes based upon its needs to pay their obligations. The trial court overruled the taxpayers' objections to the tax levy and they appealed. The court affirmed the judgment except for the portion of the taxes that had been levied in excess of the amount appropriated by the District. The court stated that the methods used by the District for appropriating and levying the taxes was permitted. The court held that the District was required to appropriate for loss and cost, and their failure to do so precluded them from levying a tax for those items. The court found that the difficulty in estimating the amount for loss and cost was not a reason not to appropriate for it. The court found that the District had not needlessly accumulated its inventories and that sound business practices required the District to keep inventories on hand in order to meet the day-to-day needs of the District.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in so far as the District illegally levied taxes in excess of the amount appropriated for the budget year.

Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 222.1, 222.2 (1953), which gave banking powers to building and loan associations. The taxpayer contended that such powers violated the Ill. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5, (1870), which provided that the legislature could not authorize or create associations with banking powers of deposit without a vote of the people. Thus, at issue was determining the meaning of a &quot;banking power of deposit&quot; as used in the constitution. Section 10.2 of the Act authorized building and loan associations to issue investment certificates. The court held that the action of issuing investment certificates constituted receipt of deposits from the general public, clearly a banking function. Accordingly, Section 10.2 of the Act was unconstitutional and void. Under the doctrine of separability, the other provisions of the Act were not invalidated because of the unconstitutionality of Section 10.2.

The employees filed an action, based on &sect; 17-15, to recover the wages they would have earned had they not taken the time off to vote. The circuit court found in favor of the employees, and on appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the &quot;pay-while-voting legislation&quot; was not a valid exercise of the state's police power because the statute was not reasonably designed to remedy the threat to voter participation. The court concluded that to shift the whole voting burden from the voting employee to the employer because he happened to stand in an economic relationship to the employees was unreasonable. The court found that there was no justification for a view that the problem of decreased election participation had arisen from the master-servant relationship.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Director of Public Safety and the Attorney General, challenged the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered a declaratory judgment for appellee, a fireworks corporation, holding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 276.27 (1953) did not apply to the &quot;manufacture or sale&quot; of sparklers or that, if the legislature so intended, the act was invalid and unconstitutional insofar as it applied to the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue was whether the legislature, by the amendatory enactment of para. 276.27 in 1953, intended to prohibit the manufacture or sale of &quot;sparklers&quot; in Illinois. Affirming the judgment, the court noted that all prior legislation on the issue clearly excepted sparklers from the definition of fireworks, but para. 276.27 did not do so. However, para. 276.27 also did not expressly state that the sale of sparklers was prohibited. Thus the court resorted to rules of construction to decide the issue. Noting that para. 276.27 had to be strictly construed because it was in derogation of common law, the court held that it was not permitted to extend the meaning of the statute. The court could not have found that para. 276.27 prohibited the manufacture or sale of sparklers except by implication, and the rule of strict construction prevented it from doing so. Further, &sect; 2 of the Fireworks Regulation Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 276.2 (1953), did not include sparklers in the definition of fireworks. It was unlikely that the legislature intended to define sparklers as fireworks for one purpose and as not being fireworks for another purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that an amended statute did not prohibit the manufacture or sale of sparklers. The court therefore did not have to reach the question of whether the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court agreed with the shareholder and found that the statute, and therefore the bylaw adopted pursuant thereto, was unconstitutional and void. The court affirmed, holding that the classification of the directors permitted by the statute and their election for staggered terms violated Ill. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3, which guaranteed shareholders the right to cumulate their votes in director elections. The statute was in conflict not only with the purpose of affording proportional representation, but also with the natural effect of the constitutional language. The long period of time that the statute had been in effect did not immunize it from constitutional attack, and the trial court was correct in its judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People challenged a ruling of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois), which denied a petition for a writ of mandamus directing appellee county clerk to extend a tax to the rate of 10 cents on each $ 100 valuation so as to meet an amount set by the county board of supervisors. The clerk extended the tax at a lower rate which was the maximum authorized by &sect; 162a of the Illinois Revenue Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 643a (1953).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People argued that para. 643a was unconstitutional and that the clerk exceeded his authority in extending the rate. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. Initially, the clerk attacked the sufficiency of the People's brief for lack of full compliance with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 39. However, those requirements were procedural, and because the brief sufficiently defined the issues raised therein, the appeal could not be dismissed for noncompliance. As to the merits, the court noted that the clerk had a duty to extend the lower tax rate under the terms of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 643a (1953) which directed the clerk to disregard the additional, unauthorized amount. Moreover, there was no merit to the People's claim that para. 643a was special legislation in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. The opinion the People relied on in advancing that claim did not apply because it related specifically to a statute which sought to establish variant tax rates for libraries and similarity between the two statutes was not a sufficient argument upon which to base a claim of invalidity. Consequently, there was no basis for reversing the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Appellants attacked on due process grounds the constitutionality of the notice provision of the annexation statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 4B-4 (1953), and claimed that the proceedings should have been held in abeyance until a decision was reached in a prior, related proceeding. Affirming the circuit court, the court held that para. 4B-4 did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in light of the legislature's authority to form school districts and fix boundaries without giving any notice whatsoever. The court also found appellees were not prohibited from acting until the related annexation proceeding was finalized.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 228 (1947).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had already been sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment when he was convicted of larceny. While confined in jail, defendant attempted to assist a fellow prisoner's escape attempt. Defendant unsuccessfully filed a motion for a new trial on the aiding an escape charge, asserting that the indictment was defective because it did not allege specific intent or specify his prior convictions. Defendant appealed and argued that the trial court did not have authority to impose consecutive sentences, the indictment for the aiding an escape charge was defective, para. 228 was unconstitutional, and his sentences were impermissibly vague. In affirming, the court held that the trial court clearly had authority to impose consecutive sentences; the fact that the legislature required such sentences to be imposed for certain crimes did not abrogate the trial court's power. Because defendant was charged with aiding in an escape, no allegation of specific intent was required. Para. 228 was constitutional because there was a rational reason for punishing someone who aided an escape, rather than the escapee, due to the security risk posed by internal collusion. The sentences were not vague.</SPAN></P>

The accountants argued that para. 28 was an ex post facto law insofar as it allowed the university to issue certificates to persons who had passed an examination that &quot;heretofore&quot; had been conducted by the university, as the legislation defining such prior examinations was deemed invalid. On appeal, the court determined that para. 28 was concerned with the qualifications of candidates for certificates as certified public accountants, and that a relevant consideration was the fact that a candidate had shown his knowledge by successfully passing a prescribed examination.

Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 264 et seq. (1953). Reversing the circuit court judgment that declared the challenged provisions unconstitutional, the court stated that when the action for declaratory judgment was commenced in the circuit court, the county court proceeding had reached the point where the matter was to come on for hearing on the objections to the petition for annexation. As the matter was pending in county court, and that court's jurisdiction was based upon a statutory grant of power, the declaratory judgment process could not have been used to oust the county court of its jurisdiction to pass upon the matter.</SPAN></P>

Section 52.1-1 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because the general assembly could lawfully enact a statute, the operation of which was dependent upon a contingent event. The power to approve a proposed plan was not unfettered as the required approval carried no legal consequences unless and until the city council took action by passing an ordinance. The court rejected the landowner's argument that the petition to condemn did not sufficiently aver compliance with the statutory requirements for condemning property.

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 et seq. (1953), expired prior to dates of contested assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a retail business, contended that Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18, prohibited a continuing appropriation, and Ill Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 should have been interpreted as requiring each General Assembly of the State of Illinois to impose taxes to meet appropriations it made. Under this reasoning, the General Assembly would have been prohibited from passing any revenue measure that extended beyond the biennial period for which an appropriation could have been made, and the assessment of the tax in question was invalid, as the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act was not in force on the dates in question. The court reiterated its prior validation of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. It was further determined that although the plenary power over the subject of taxation was vested in the General Assembly except insofar as the power was restricted by the state or federal constitutions, the framers of the Constitution of the State of Illinois did not intend to limit the effect on tax legislation as contended by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

At the time of his application, an action of the legislature repealing a provision of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Law providing for an optional mileage weight tax in lieu of a flat tax had been declared unconstitutional in a class action, and the relevant case was pending appeal. Because the Secretary had been enjoined from enforcing the flat tax pursuant to that action, the taxpayer paid the weight tax. The court reversed the prior judgment, holding the legislation constitutional, and the Secretary brought an action against the taxpayer seeking the additional tax due under the amendment. The taxpayer paid the tax under protest and filed an action to enjoin appellants from transferring those funds from the protest fund and seeking a refund. The trial court dismissed the Secretary's action on the grounds that full payment had been made and granted the taxpayer injunctive relief. Appellants sought review of the order for injunctive relief, and the court held that the taxpayer was not entitled to retain the benefit of the erroneous decision holding the legislation in question invalid because the reversal abrogated that decree.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint and rendered judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff appealed directly to the court on the grounds that a constitutional question was involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he was a real-estate broker, resided in the village, and had his principal place of business therein, but alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void. The trial court found that the ordinance, in so far as it applied to brokers, was uncertain, incomplete, and constituted an unwarranted delegation of legislative power to the enforcing officer. The questions presented were whether the ordinance by which plaintiff purported to exercise such power was so indefinite and uncertain as to deprive defendant of due process of law and whether it unlawfully left to a ministerial officer the determination of the class to which it applied. The court found that the term &quot;broker&quot; being one of generally accepted definition, the ordinance did not vest in the village clerk discretion to determine the class to whom it should be applied, and, therefore, did not constitute an unwarranted delegation of legislative power. The legislature had expressly authorized municipalities to license, tax, and regulate brokers, and the court saw no reason why an ordinance requiring a license of every broker doing business in the municipality was not a valid exercise of such power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance in dispute provided that the Treasurer was also to serve as the ex officio township collector, that all commissions due him in the matter of collecting taxes were to be paid into the City's treasury, and that his only compensation was to be a salary as fixed by the City's council. The Treasurer filed a complaint alleging that the ordinance was invalid and that he was entitled to retain the commissions allowed by statute upon taxes collected by township collectors in addition to his salary as Treasurer. On appeal, the court considered Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 9-99 (1953), which restricted a city employee's compensation to that fixed by statute, and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 139, paras. 134, 135, 60 (1953), which permitted cities such as the City to unite the offices of city treasurer and township collector and thereafter to elect only a city treasurer. The court ruled that under those statutes, the City was authorized to combine the offices of the Treasurer and the collector, and when such consolidation was effected, the salary to be paid to the Treasurer was to be determined by the City council. Thus, the Treasurer was entitled to no compensation other than his salary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the question of whether a variation of use should be granted was a legislative decision and that the legislative decision would not be overruled by the court unless it was arbitrary and capricious. The court also held that the question of whether a variation was related to public safety, health, and welfare was a legislative question and would only be overruled if there were an abuse of discretion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenants in low-rent public housing projects owned and operated by appellee housing authority challenged the judgment of the Municipal Court of Chicago (Illinois), which granted summary judgment in favor of the housing authority in its multiple forcible entry and detainer actions against several tenants. The tenants appealed on the theory that constitutional questions were involved. The causes were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants were served with notices terminating their tenancies for failure and refusal to subscribe to the loyalty oath required by such tenants by &sect; 25.01 of the Housing Authorities Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 67 1/2, para. 25.01 (1953). One tenant argued against the certificate of nonmembership in subversive groups. The tenants argued that the housing authority had no power under the statute or the constitution to require the oath or certificate. The housing authority argued that because, under the lease, it was able to evict the tenants at any time upon notice, the fact that it assigned a reason therefore was immaterial and did not raise any constitutional issue. The court reversed the lower court's judgment. The court held that even though the tenants had no right to remain as tenants of the housing authority, they could not as a condition of continued occupancy be required to comply with unconstitutional requirements. The court found that the tenants had standing even though none of them were actually in violation of what the oath forbade because the ground for eviction was not membership or affiliation itself, but the failure to take the prescribed oath.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged an annexation to their school district. Appellants urged that &sect; 4B-4 of the School Code, Ill. Rev.

The court rejected appellants' contention that &sect; 4B-4 did not constitute a sufficient guide by which the board could determine whether or not the petition for annexation should be allowed. Section 4B-4 specified the type of evidence that should be heard and considered at a hearing on an annexation petition. The court concluded that the statutory specifications as to what evidence could be submitted and the detailing of what matters could be considered by the board were as definite as could be formulated. The court held that the notice of the hearing was sufficient. The court rejected appellants' contention that the decision of the board and of the circuit court was not in the best interests of the schools in the area and was against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

G of the Industrial Home Work Act was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1,2, and Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 2 prohibited the processing of metal springs by home workers. Plaintiffs' evidence showed that the hand tools used by the workers were completely harmless and that over a period of eight years there had never been any injuries associated with the use of foot presses. The lower court entered a permanent injunction against the enforcement of &sect; 2, and the court affirmed. The court held that every citizen was guaranteed the right to engage in any lawful, useful, and harmless business. The court further held that that it was not within the constitutional authority of the State legislature in the exercise of its police power to interfere with that right of an individual where no interest of the public safety, welfare or morals was threatened. Because the processing of metal springs did not invoke any matters of public concern because the process was safe, the court ruled that &sect; 2 was an invalid exercise of police power and violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1,2, and Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village reclassified the owner's property under its zoning ordinance from industrial to residential. The trial court held that the ordinance was unreasonable, unconstitutional, and void as to the owner's property. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that the trial court was correct in its determination that the property was wholly unsuited for residential purposes and that to solely restrict its use destroyed substantial values. Industrial activity surrounded the owner's property on three sides. In addition, it was also bounded by railroad tracks frequently used by freight and passenger trains. The court ruled that the village's ordinance bore no relation to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare and was therefore unconstitutional, illegal, and void. The court ruled that there was no proof that the residential properties adjacent to the owner's property would suffer if one more industrial operation was added to the great number in that area. However, if only residential use was enforced, the owner would suffer appreciable damage. The value of the land as industrial was $ 105,000. The value of the land as residential was $ 30,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to serve two years in a county jail. The appellate court's decision was based on a case that was decided after the court originally transferred the case to the appellate division. That case held that the first offense of possession of a narcotic drug was a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment in a county jail and not by imprisonment in a penitentiary. Defendant argued that the municipal court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter or of defendant and that defendant was convicted without due process in violation of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 8 and U.S. Const. amend. V. The court, however, found that U.S. Const. amend. V imposed restrictions on the federal government and not on the states. Therefore, that amendment was not controlling. The court next found that it was not necessary that defendant be prosecuted only by indictment of a grand jury because the crime of possession of any narcotic drug was a misdemeanor in that it was punishable by a fine. Finally, the omission of a place of confinement in &sect; 2 of the Municipal Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 357 (1951), raised a conclusive presumption that confinement was proper in a county jail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question for review was whether the 1953 amendment to the Family Court Act violated any constitutional right on the part of the mother whatever, either to due process procedurally, or in substance to the eventual custody, care, tuition, and control of her child. The mother was adjudged to be a mentally ill person by the county court and committed to a state hospital for the mentally ill. A decree of the same court adjudged her son to be a dependent child. The state petitioned the lower court to allow the child to be adopted because his mother was mentally ill and his father had died. The mother's guardian argued that the 1953 amendment violated substantive due process. The court found that although the possibility existed, it did not invalidate the Family Court Act. It further held that the 1953 amendment did not constitute a violation of the substantive requirements of due process. Ordinary notice of the intended application for the entry of an order was all that was necessary. Furthermore, the retrospective operation of the amendment did not render it invalid.
