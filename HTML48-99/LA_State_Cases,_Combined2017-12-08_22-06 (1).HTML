<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing for the partition of property held after the husband and wife were divorced, the trial court found that two assets, a piece of real estate and an automobile, were the husband's separate property. The document of purchase of the piece of real estate contained a declaration by the husband that he was purchasing the property with his separate and paraphernal funds and that the property was to be his separate and paraphernal property. The wife acknowledged that declaration. The court affirmed the trial court determination that the property was the husband's separate property because the rule that a husband would not be heard to contradict his prior acknowledgment that property purchased by his wife was her separate property applied equally to a wife who acknowledged that property purchased by her husband was his separate property. The determination that the automobile was the husband's separate property was also affirmed because the husband had purchased the automobile when the couple were domiciled in Pennsylvania, which was not a community property state, and the law of Pennsylvania governed the classification of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother sought to have defendant declared the father of her child. On defendant's appeal, the issues presented were whether the blood test evidence was admissible, whether the mother proved filiation by a preponderance of evidence, and whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:396-398 was constitutional. A doctor testified at trial concerning the procedures involved for maintaining the integrity of the tests and his conclusion that the probability of defendant being the father of the child was 99.8 percent. The trial court, exercising its discretion under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:397.2, admitted the evidence. On appeal, the court found no abuse of that discretion and would not disturb the trial court's ruling on admissibility. The court also found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9:396-398 was not unconstitutional due to vagueness. The court was not impressed with defendant's complaints that the terms &quot;blood tests,&quot; &quot;experts,&quot; and &quot;blood types&quot; were not adequately defined in the statutes. The court found that men of common intelligence could clearly understand the meanings of these terms.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed, by a writ of certiorari, a judgment of the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Section E (Louisiana), which granted defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence which was seized from his person pursuant to a warrantless search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving his motorcycle when he was pulled him for not wearing eye protection. The officers noticed that defendant's driver's license did not have a motorcycle endorsement and because he lacked the proper endorsement, they effected a custodial arrest of defendant. They also performed a search incident to the arrest and found a concealed gun and knife. Defendant was charged with being a convicted felon in possession of the firearm. The trial court suppressed the gun. Defendant contended that the gun was properly suppressed because he was unlawfully arrested. The court held that anyone who operated a motorcycle in Louisiana had to obtain the proper endorsement on his license and that failure to do so constituted a misdemeanor offense. It rejected defendant's contention that instead of arresting him, the police could have issued him a summons and it held that defendant was subject to a full custody arrest because he would have continued to commit the offense of driving without a proper endorsement had he not been arrested. The court further held that defendant was subject to a search incident to the lawful arrest and thus, the evidence seized was not suppressible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice suit, plaintiff, as curator for the patient, sued defendants for injuries suffered by the patient during her hospitalization and treatment in the psychiatric ward of a medical center owned by the state and operated by defendant. Plaintiff successfully proved at trial that the patient was misdiagnosed for psychotic depression and wrongly administered certain antipsychotic drugs over a period of five weeks in dosages and combinations which reached toxic levels in her bloodstream. Weakened and poisoned by the drugs, she eventually suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and suffered massive permanent brain damage as a result. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the patient, but under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 40:1299.39 limited defendant's liability. On appeal, the court held that the statutory limitation was applicable and was constitutional. The court reasoned that the statute applied in any claim against the state that could rationally be classified as one for malpractice, whether based upon the negligence of an individual health care provider or upon the negligence of the medical staff of a state-owned health care facility as a whole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), granted plaintiff wife a divorce from defendant husband. The wife appealed the portion of the judgment dismissing her claim to a community property interest in the proceeds of a $ 285,000 worker's compensation settlement received by the husband, resulting from a personal injury sustained on his job three months prior to dissolution of the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the trial court's judgment, holding that the settlement was the separate property of the husband, subject to an equitable apportionment for community loss from the date of the injury to the date of dissolution. Because the wife had already received $ 10,000 from the husband following his recovery of the settlement proceeds, an amount that exceeded any amount or equitable apportionment reasonably due the wife for losses to the community during the three-month period, she was not entitled to any further recovery. The court noted that the husband was injured in December of 1979, and prior to January 1, 1980, personal injury awards inuring to the husband were deemed community property. The trial court had based its decision on the newly enacted La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2344, which provided that damages due to personal injuries sustained during the existence of the community by a spouse were separate property. The wife argued that the court should have applied the old law. The court held that under both the new law and the old law, as it had been interpreted by the courts, the settlement was the separate property of the husband, less the equitable apportionment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of negligent homicide that resulted when he crossed over into on coming traffic and killed a passenger in another vehicle. Defendant raised numerous points of error on appeal. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting statements made by defendant to officers at the scene immediately following the accident because he was not yet in custody. The trial judge did not err in admitting testimony and evidence regarding the photoelectric intoximeter test, including its results. Defendant admitting to signing a rights form when he took the test, which fully complied with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:661(c). The evidence further showed that the inspecting technician's testimony established the validity of the test and its results. Statements made by another driver to his wife moments before the accident were admissible under the res gestae exception. The court found that the State presented sufficient evidence that the defendant had committed negligent homicide to warrant the trial judge's denial of the motion for acquittal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before being charged with the instant offense, defendant pled guilty to an arson which arose from a fire at a business and he was placed on probation. He subsequently made two threats of arson to the carpenters who were working on the reconstruction of the business. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the bill of information because the allegations against him did not constitute proscribed conduct under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:54.1. The court held that the language of &sect; 14.54.1 did not appear to have a generally understood meaning sufficient to give adequate warning of the proscribed conduct and that men of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning. Because &sect; 14:54.1 was capable of at least two reasonable, but conflicting interpretations, it was unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the maximum penalty imposed for a violation of &sect; 14:54.1 was disproportionate to the severity of the crime and thus, its sentencing provision violated the Eighth Amendment to the federal Constitution and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court held that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to quash and it dismissed the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial, the prosecutor was permitted to cross-examine both defendant and a defense witness concerning their use of drugs. After conviction, the State filed a multiple offender charge under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. &sect; 15:529.1, and defendant was sentenced to the maximum of 24 years at hard labor. On review, defendant brought six assignments of error, complaining chiefly about improper cross-examination and an excessive sentence. The court rejected defendant's arguments, finding that defense counsel had opened the door to cross-examination and that the trial court had given a proper curative admonition to the jury when requested by the defense. The court examined the sentence and found that the record supported adequate compliance with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. Also, the court held that the sentence was not constitutionally excessive because the trial court had stated on the record that the maximum sentence was required to prevent the commission of other crimes by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee commenced an action against the employer for worker's compensation benefits. The trial court awarded benefits to the employee. The employer moved for a suspensive appeal and after a reviewing court amended the trial court's findings, the employer sought a rehearing to determine whether it was entitled to reduce its worker's compensation payments under &sect; 23:1225. The trial court determined that the employer could reduce the worker's compensation payments from the date the employer had specifically demanded the benefits of &sect; 23:1225. The employee appealed, arguing that the trial court erred by not considering defendant's demand to have been made only after the date of the trial court's judgment on remand, or, alternatively, only after the case was remanded to the trial court. The court held that the employer's blanket assertion of payment of all sums due did not mention social security payments and did not give the employee the required notice. The employer's judicial demand was made when the employer filed a petition with a court to receive the reduction provided for in &sect; 23:1225. The employee's attorney was entitled to an increase in fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, which convicted her of possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance and sentenced her to 10 years at hard labor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to sentencing, the trial judge received a presentence report, and defendant's counsel submitted a memorandum and orally argued mitigating factors in defendant's favor. Defendant had been law abiding since a previous conviction, worked, and got along with others. Her counsel argued that defendant was only in trouble because she turned to a drug dealer after the deaths of several family members and that incarceration would be an undue hardship on defendant's children. The record reflected that the trial judge adequately considered the guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in particularizing the sentence to defendant. He noted the mitigating factors but also stated that defendant had previously committed a violent crime and had knowingly and indiscriminately sold the drugs. He saw no excuse for her conduct and determined that a lesser sentence would deprecate the crime's seriousness. The court could not say that the sentence violated La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 by being excessive. There was no manifest abuse of discretion in the trial judge's imposition of the sentence, which was within the statutory limits and took into consideration the mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Governor of Louisiana, appealed a judgment from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which had ruled in favor of plaintiff individuals, including the Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana, in their action for a declaration that the Governor's line item veto, as applied to the Lieutenant Governor's office budget, was unconstitutional. The Lieutenant Governor was granted a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal involved essentially procedural issues rather than substantive questions as to whether the trial court correctly issued a preliminary injunction in connection with a suit for declaratory and permanent injunctive relief. For information purposes, the substantive issue in the main demand concerned constitutional limitations both on the exercise of the Governor's veto power and on judicial review of actions by a co-equal branch of government. The Lieutenant Governor had persuaded the Senate Finance Committee to increase the salaries item for his office in a budget bill. The Governor, pursuant to La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5(G)(1), then vetoed the salaries line item. The Lieutenant Governor and others sued to have declared, and permanently enjoined as unconstitutional, the gubernatorial line item veto of the salaries item from the operating budget of his office for that fiscal year. The trial court held the line item veto to be unconstitutional. The court reversed and held that the Lieutenant Governor failed to make a prima facie showing either that the veto was unconstitutionally exercised or that it resulted in irreparable harm to the Office of Lieutenant Governor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Supreme Court for the State of Louisiana, the court was instructed to reconsider its earlier decision, which held that La.

Ann. &sect; 33:1992 et seq. did not apply to defendant City because of the City's Home Rule Charter with constitutional status, was still viable after the adoption of the 1974 constitution. Plaintiff firemen brought a class action seeking recalculation of accrued longevity, overtime and holiday pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had affirmed the lower court's decision that the class action was appropriate, that estoppel by laches did not bar collection of that part of the extra pay against which prescription had not run, and that the rights granted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:1992, 1994 and 1999 were not automatically bestowed by the adoption of the Constitution of 1974 without some additional action on the part of the legislature. The court reconsidered its decision in light of the Supreme Court's decision in another case, which held that La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 removed the obstacle to the application of the provisions of the firemen's minimum wage law to the City. The court, applying that decision, held that further legislative action was not necessary. The court cited language of the Supreme Court's decision stating that the fire and police minimum wage provision of art. 6, &sect; 14 was not only an exception to the home-rule financial autonomy created by the remainder of the section, but also is a positive reaffirmance of the plenary power of the legislature to guarantee adequate fire and police protection for all citizens of Louisiana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish police jury passed an ordinance in which it designated the parish treasurer as the official collector of the parish occupational license taxes.

The sheriff sued the police jury seeking (1) to enjoin them from collecting these taxes, (2) seeking to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional and (3) seeking a decree declaring the sheriff to be the proper official to collect these parish taxes. The police jury and parish appealed from a judgment in favor of the sheriff. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the parish police jury had the authority to designate someone other than the sheriff of the parish as the collector of the parish's occupational license tax.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction asserting that the trial court erred by not allowing both of his defense counsel to make a closing argument. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:20 and his sentence. The appeals court affirmed. The court held that defendant failed to preserve the error for review because defense counsel failed to proffer a reason at the time the objection was made. The trial court was not given an opportunity to rule on the objection and to cure any defect. The court held, however, that there was no prejudice because one of the defense counsels gave a closing argument. The trial court had great discretion in limiting the amount of time for giving a closing argument and there was no abuse. Second, because defendant failed to rise the constitutionality argument at the trial level, the issue was not preserved for appellate review. Third, defendant's sentence was not excessive given the fact that defendant shot the victim at the time the victim actually attacked him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a teacher's association and its member, challenged the judgment from the Seventh Judicial District Court Parish of Concordia, State of Louisiana, which denied their prayer for an injunction to prevent the distribution of any funds pursuant to an incentive pay plan of defendant school board, declared that the pay plan was both lawful and constitutional, and dismissed the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher's association and its member argued that the incentive pay plan authorizes a deduction from teachers' salaries for the use of sick leave in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1201 et seq. They also claimed that the pay plan constitutes a donation of public funds in violation of La. Const. Art. VII, &sect; 14 (1974.) On appeal, the court found it unnecessary to reach the issues raised because the action had become moot. The trial court had denied the request of the teacher's association and its member for a temporary restraining order pending the resolution of the suit. The association and its member did not apply for supervisory writs to review the ruling by the trial court. Thus, the school board proceeded with the implementation of the plan. It was uncontested that the funds had been distributed at the time of the appeal. The record showed that the school board had not adopted such an incentive pay plan prior to the school year at issue, and that there were no plans to re-institute the plan in future years. Under such circumstances, a declaration by the court concerning the validity of the plan would serve no useful purpose, nor could it afford any practical relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal of the trial court's judgment was dismissed as moot. All costs were assessed to the teacher's association and its member.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed suit to collect sales tax on the spa's sales of memberships under Lake Charles, La., Ordinance 1535. The trial court rendered judgment for the city. On appeal, the spa argued that the city assessment was barred by a decision of the state tax appeal board, that the ordinance was unconstitutional, that its facilities were not athletic or recreational, and that penalties were not warranted. In affirming, the court held that, although the definition of sales under Lake Charles, La., Ordinance 1535, art. 301, &sect; 1(b)(2) was identical to the state tax definition, the city was not bound by the state tax appeal board decision interpreting the state tax provision to exclude its tax on spa membership sales. The court adopted the trial court's finding that the spa's facilities were recreational and athletic, as well as the trial court's holding that the ordinance was constitutional. With regard to penalties and fees, the court found that the spa had stipulated to the amount of the assessment if judgment were rendered in the city's favor and that this amount included the penalties and fees.</SPAN></P>

The transcript from the previous conviction that the previous court asked whether defendant understood that by pleading guilty he gave up the right to an attorney for trial, while the minutes indicated that defendant was more fully advised of his right to counsel at all stages if he were indigent. The court held that defendant was clearly not advised of his right to counsel in accord with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 514, and that the previous conviction could not be used as evidence to enhance the penalty on the present offense. The court held that the U.S. Const. amend. V privilege against self-incrimination did not apply to real and demonstrative evidence, such as field sobriety tests, and that the officers' failure to advise defendant of his Miranda rights before administering the tests was not reversible error.</SPAN></P>

He alleged 15 errors on appeal, including the failure of the trial judge to allow his counsel to rehabilitate him after his testimony was impeached by the use of prior convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers responded to a telephone call that a rape was in progress in an abandoned apartment. When the police got to the address, a child stated that her &quot;daddy&quot; had just rapped her. The police entered the apartment and a 10-year child stated that her &quot;daddy&quot; had attempted to rape her. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence from the trial court. Defendant had complained that the trial court's refusal to allow him to explain the details of his prior conviction for manslaughter violated his rights in that he had no opportunity to rehabilitate himself as a witness. The court held that the trial court properly denied his attempt to introduce the facts surrounding his previous conviction for manslaughter because the facts would not have tended to prove or disprove any material fact in his trial. Defendant complained that his counsel was never served with a copy of the amended jury charges. The court held that his counsel was entitled to a copy under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 801. The court held that this error was not prejudicial because the charges were discussed in chamber and only slight changes were made to the original charges which the counsel had received.</SPAN></P>

Defendant &quot;whipped&quot; a child for braking the taillight in the car. The child was taken to the hospital, but was not hospitalized. Defendant pleaded guilty. The district court accepted the plea. Defendant was given a three year suspended sentence at hard labor and was placed on supervised probation for four years. A special condition of probation was that defendant serve six month in the parish jail. Defendant appealed the sentence imposed, asserting that the district court improperly considered factors set for in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 and in imposing a six month jail sentence. Defendant urged that the six month sentence was excessive. On review, the court found no merit in defendant's contentions. The court held that the district court judge fairly considered the provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court stressed that defendant could have received a 10 year sentence and hardly viewed a six month term in jail as excessive.

Initially charged with aggravated rape, he pleaded guilty to sexual battery. In affirming the imposition of the maximum sentence for the offense, the court held that the trial court was not unduly influenced by the initial charge. While the court acknowledged that the maximum offense was reserved for the most serious violation of the statute and the worst type of offender, the sentence was not inappropriate considering that the facts demonstrated the worst type of sexual battery. The court also noted proof that the battery was the victim's first sexual encounter, that defendant had six prior convictions which resulted in three jail or prison terms and three probated sentences, and that during each probationary period defendant was convicted of a subsequent offense. The court also held that the trial court had complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 and that the plea bargain was a proper factor to consider in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The victim was alerted to the intrusion and shot it out with the intruder, sustaining four bullet wounds. Defendants were charged with attempted murder, but pleaded guilty to the lesser offenses. In affirming their convictions, the court first held that defendants' motion to recuse the district's trial judges under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 674, which they filed after they pleaded guilty, was filed too late for consideration. The court next held that defendants failed to prove that the trial court was influenced by a newspaper ad and letter writing campaign that exhorted the imposition of the maximum sentence. The court also held that the sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, given that the evidence tended to prove the more serious, originally charged crimes. Finally the court held that the State was not required to file a bill of information charging defendants under La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the caesarian section delivery of her child, the wife developed a serious infection that required additional hospitalization. In response to plaintiffs' suit, the doctor and his insurer filed an exception of prematurity alleging that plaintiffs failed to present their complaint to a medical review panel as required under &sect; 40:1299.47(B)(1). Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the entire Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47 et seq., as a denial of equal protection and procedural due process. In support of their challenge, plaintiffs cited case law from other jurisdictions. The court found that the posture of the case--a response to a plea of prematurity grounded solely in the provisions of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. He was sentenced to 25 years at hard labor with credit for time served. In affirming the decision, the court held that it was within the trial court's discretion to refuse to disclose the pre-sentence information because the presentence report was not shown to be materially and prejudicially false. Further, the sentence imposed was not excessive. The criteria as set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 were properly considered. Because of the serious nature of the offense, which endangered human life, a lesser sentence tended to diminish the seriousness of the crime. In fact, the sentence was nearer the minimum side of the statutory range, showing that the mitigating factors were given due weight, than the maximum. However, the sentence was illegal because a sentence for armed robbery was to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant complained that there was no evidence to establish the required specific intent. The court disagreed and held that the State had proven specific intent. The court noted that specific criminal intent was that state of mind which existed when the circumstances indicated that defendant actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:10(1). The court noted that that the State was required to have proven specific intent on the part of defendant to kill the victim. Although intent was a fact question it need not be proven as fact. Instead, it may be inferred from the circumstances of the transaction. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:445.

The court then recalled the writs, set aside a stay order, and remanded the case. The court found that the writs were improvidently granted. Although the court had supervisory jurisdiction over all cases within its circuit, pursuant to La. Const. art.

On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued that the pretrial identification should have been suppressed, that the evidence was insufficient, and that the trial court erred in denying a continuance. In affirming, the court ruled that defendant failed to establish that the photo arrays and the line up were suggestive and that, although the victim's one-on-one encounter was not condoned, it did not violate his rights because, even if it was suggestive, the evidence showed the identification was reliable. The court also ruled that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offense and that the degree of force employed warranted the greater punishment of aggravated rape under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42(2) rather than that for forcible rape under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42.1.

La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1. The trial court sentenced him to nine years and 11 months' imprisonment at hard labor and a $ 3,000 fine. In lieu of payment of this fine, defendant was ordered to serve an additional 30 days in jail. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially charged with attempted murder. An officer on patrol observed a person yelling from a balcony. He then saw persons running for a truck. He then saw a gray car driving off. He stopped the car, which was occupied by defendant and a female companion. The officer found a loaded pistol on the dashboard. Affirming the conviction, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant. The trial court did not err in refusing to allow defense counsel to ask the jury pool whether they were proponents of gun control legislation, or in excusing for cause a juror that stated unequivocally that he looked on all police officers negatively based on a bad experience he had had with an officer in the past. The investigation of the shooting incident and the determination that the gun had been fired formed part of a continuous transaction involving defendant's possession of the firearm. Therefore, officers' testimony was relevant and clearly admissible as part of the res gestae. The court set aside the sentence because the trial court failed to adhere to the statutory guidelines for sentencing, preventing the court from determining whether it was excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was given a letter of warning and charged with insubordination.

The court also held that the commission had no power to declare the constitutionality of state statutes and vacated its decision to that extent. The supreme court reversed and remanded. On remand, the court held that the commission did not establish a legal cause for the disciplinary action as required by La. Const. art. 10, &sect; 8(A). The fact that the employee failed to submit overtime requests prior to the work being performed on three occasions did not constitute an impairment of the efficiency of the public service. The court ordered the reprimand stricken from his personnel file. The court also held that La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his six-year sentence at hard labor as being excessive. The appeals court affirmed the sentence. The court held that when the sentencing guidelines had been adequately considered, the court's standard of review was to determine whether the penalty imposed was so disproportionate to the crime committed, in light of the harm caused to society, as to shock the court's sense of justice. The trial court's judgment would not be set aside absent a showing of manifest abuse of the trial court's discretion. The evidence indicated that although defendant was a first time offender, he was addicted to drugs and alcohol, that he was unemployed and that he was likely to continue selling illegal drugs. The court noted that the mere fact that other offenders who were convicted of the same offense did not receive the same punishment did not render defendant's sentence excessive. A controlled environment of incarceration would ensure the abstention from alcohol and illicit drugs, which defendant required, and that would best prevent defendant's return to illegal drug activity.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge rendered judgment in favor of the legatees and against the children, sustaining the exception of no cause of action and dismissing the plaintiffs' claims. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the children stated a cause of action. The court found that a prior decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that La. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a trial court judgment holding that defendants did not unconstitutionally exclude the employees from a pay adjustment put in effect by the Civil Service Commission. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants implemented a pay adjustment in a pay plan for classified employees, which affected only 521 out of 2,442 existing classes of state employees, and that plaintiffs were members of classes which were excluded from the pay adjustment. They alleged that the exclusion was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. On appeal the court held that the evidence was clear that not all classes were treated equally, that is, all classes did not receive comparable pay increases. The issue was whether the difference in treatment of the classes was supported by a rational basis. The trial court properly held that before the increase the salaries for positions included in the pay adjustment were far below the rate paid for similar jobs in private industry, and that the salaries for positions excluded were already in line with market conditions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim noticed defendant's hand in her purse. Her husband grabbed defendant and brought him to the police station. He was convicted of attempted purse snatching and adjudicated a third felony offender. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction but reversed the third felony offender adjudication and remanded for resentencing. The court held that the offense described in &sect; 14:65.1 was not unconstitutionally vague and that there was sufficient justification for the greater penalty provided for this offense than for simple robbery, considering the widespread exposure of the public to the crime, the personal nature of a wallet or purse, and the potential for loss of greater value. The prosecutor's reference to &quot;force and intimidation&quot; as elements of the crime in his rebuttal argument, even if improper, did not influence the jury or contribute to their verdict. Defendant's intention to permanently deprive the victim of something of value could be inferred from his actions. A predicate for the multiple offender bill was inadequate because the minute entry of the plea agreement did not establish a prima facie case of a knowing and voluntary waiver of defendant's rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed the victim during a drug buy. Defendant was charged and found guilty of first-degree murder. Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that he was denied a fair trial. The court held that the admission of gruesome photographs of the victim and the crime scene were properly admitted at trial, because their probative value outweighed the possible prejudice that might result from their display to the jury, and the photographs were extremely relevant and corroborative of the testimony of the witnesses. The court also determined that the photographs of the crime scene were admissible as evidence of other crimes and therefore formed the res gestae. In addition, the court observed that the prosecutor did not commit misconduct during closing arguments by commenting upon defendant's failure to take the witness stand, because the overwhelming amount of evidence of guilt did not cause the jury to be swayed by the prosecutor's comments. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could only be raised on a writ of habeas corpus. The court upheld defendant's conviction and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:39 and sentenced him to a suspended sentence of six months in the parish prison, placed him on probation for two years, and ordered him to make restitution as a condition of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's car and another car collided as defendant was making a left turn, and the occupants of the other car were injured. As a result, defendant was convicted of negligent injuring under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:39, received the maximum sentence of six months in the parish prison with the sentence suspended, placed on probation for two years, and ordered to pay restitution. On review pursuant to a writ of certiorari, the court affirmed the conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded the case for resentencing. Defendant's failure to comply with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:122 when turning left provided sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant was criminally negligent under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 14:12. Thus, the evidence was sufficient for the conviction. The La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 576 dismissal of the traffic charge before defendant was charged with negligent injuring did not constitute double jeopardy under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 592, because the traffic charge was dismissed before trial. The trial court's failure to list any of the factors in La. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave her car keys to two undercover officers and told them to sample the 50 pounds of marijuana in her car. The officers did so; defendant then got into her car but was surrounded by sheriff department vehicles before she could drive off.

After her motion to suppress was denied, defendant pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 50 pounds of marijuana under La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant consented to the search of her car when she gave the officers the keys; the officers' discovery of the marijuana gave the deputies probable cause to search the car without a warrant when defendant was about to drive off. Thus, the deputy's search was lawful. The element of intent in &sect; 40:066A(1) did not make it unconstitutionally vague, and the district attorney's discretion under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The respective parents of sons who where killed in a civil disturbance on a university campus sued the former Louisiana governor and others. Six years after the court dismissed the parents' appeal of the judgment granting an insurer's motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted defendant's La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 561 motion to dismiss the suits for lack of prosecution over a five-year period. The trial court then denied the parents' motion to set aside the dismissal. On appeal, the court held that the withdrawal of the parents' counsel 21 months after the dismissal of their prior appeal was not a prosecution of the action and did not interrupt the five-year period. Although the parents were not notified of the actual date of their counsel's withdrawal, they received notice in federal court that their attorney had withdrawn. Thus, the neglect of their case caused by their former counsel's withdrawal did not constitute circumstances beyond their control.

The charges were based on the fact that the professional law corporation employing appellants represented the City of New Orleans on a contractual basis and that appellants' father was the city attorney and head of the city's law department. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the Commission and the trial court did not err in finding that the Commission's exercise of jurisdiction over appellants, as persons other than public employees, was proper under La.

From a plea bargain, one count of aggravated rape was reduced to forcible rape and the other counts were nolle prosequi'd.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed that part of the sentence made not subject to probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant contended that no more and no less than two years could be so designated as not subject to probation, parole, or suspension of sentence because of unconstitutional vagueness and ambiguity in the penal section of the forcible rape statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42.1. Defendant construed the statute as allowing the sentencing court to designate no more than two years before the specified leniency could be allowed. The court disagreed, holding that such an interpretation ignored the clear wording of the statute. Defendant's construction would have been contrary to both the letter and spirit of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:3, requiring that the provisions of criminal statutes be given a genuine construction, according to the fair import of their words taken in their usual sense in connection with the context, and with reference to the purpose of the provision.</SPAN></P>

He moved to suppress statements on the grounds of an alleged delay of compliance with a continuing discovery order. He also complained that he should have been allowed to introduce certain impeaching evidence and should have been allowed to introduce surrebuttal to show bias.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to suppress statements allegedly made to jail inmates on the grounds that the state purposely delayed its compliance with a continuing discovery order. However, the argument that the state purposely delayed notifying defendant of the statements was sorely lacking. Defendant complained that he should have been allowed to introduce, as impeaching evidence, four statements made to investigators by his companion. The companion distinctly admitted the substance and inconsistencies in his statements. He admitted to making four different statements and to lying in the first three and one-half statements. The converse of the impeachment statute was that if the witness, whose impeachment was sought, distinctly admitted making inconsistent statements, evidence of the statements was rendered inadmissible. Therefore, the court found this assignment without merit. Defendant complained that he should have been allowed to introduce surrebuttal to show an inmate's bias against him because they had engaged in homosexual conduct. However, the district court had discretion to allow surrebuttal and its ruling was not disturbed, as it was not determined that this was an extreme case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife appealed from a judgment of the Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jackson (Louisiana), which sustained defendant former husband's declinatory exception to the Louisiana court's personal jurisdiction over him. The wife sought post-divorce alimony from her former husband who moved to Texas after the parties' divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced. The wife filed an action for initial permanent post- divorce alimony claiming that she was free of fault, not remarried, and had insufficient means to support herself. The husband, after the divorce, became a Texas domiciliary, and filed a declinatory exception to the Louisiana court's personal jurisdiction over him. The trial court sustained the husband's exception and dismissed the wife's action. The wife appealed. The issue on appeal was if the long arm statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3201(f), allowed a Louisiana court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident in a case of non-support to a former spouse. The court found that the trial court was in error in dismissing the wife's action after sustaining the declinatory exception where the record was void of any evidence to support jurisdiction over this Texas defendant under the Louisiana long arm statute. However, this particular ground that justified sustaining the exception could be removed by amendment of the petition or other action of plaintiff. Therefore, the court amended the trial court judgment to order that the wife be granted leave to amend her petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment of the trial court sustaining the husband's declinatory exception to delete dismissal of the action, and ordered the action remanded to the trial court to grant leave to the wife to amend her petition within a fixed time after the court's judgment became final.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were involved in tort litigation. The primary issue in the trial court was: when two or more health care providers were solidarily liable for damages arising from patient care, did the patient's timely action for tort damages against one keep alive his rights against the others beyond the three-year limit of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. The trial court held that the patient's rights were not extinguished as to all the health care providers. The health care providers sought review. The court agreed with the trial court and concluded that &sect; 9:5628 established a simple prescription, even in its three-year period. The court noted precedent that stated that even in the timely action against a solidary co-obligor had not been filed, the three-year limit of &sect; 9:5628 would have defeated any action, notwithstanding that the malpractice was neither known nor reasonably knowable by the patient prior to the three-year limit. The court deemed the three-year limit of &sect; 9:5628 simple prescription then added a limit upon the one-year-from-discovery by providing that in all events such claims had to be filed at the latest within three years of the malpractice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court against the health care providers which refused to declare those rights to hold them solidarily liable for damages extinguished.</SPAN></P>

The district court jury found defendant guilty of attempted simple burglary of a vehicle, and sentenced defendant as a multiple offender to 12 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed, contending that his sentence was imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. The court noted that the statutorily prescribed penalty for attempted simple burglary was punishable by incarceration of up to six years, with or without hard labor. Where a defendant was a second offender, the penalty could be enhanced to provide for imprisonment, with or without hard labor for not less than two years nor more than 12 years.

The court held that the illegitimate children may not inherit from the decedent's estate, and that the surviving spouse was entitled to inherit the entire estate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action seeking to have the parish ordinance declared invalid. The ordinance provided for a $ 100 annual permit fee for each emergency auto wrecker that was operated in the parish. The trial court determined that the ordinance violated La. Rev. Stat.

The court reasoned that because the statute specifically limited the license fee to $ 10 per person per year, the ordinance was invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient initiated a medical malpractice action against the doctor following complications with surgery to the patient's shoulder area. The doctor filed an exception of prescription on the basis that the suit was not initiated within three years of the date of the alleged act of malpractice, as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. The trial court maintained the exception of prescription, and the patient appealed and claimed that &sect; 9:5628 was an unconstitutional deprivation of due process and equal protection. The court affirmed and found that the statute did not affect a fundamental right or create a suspect classification. The court held that the classification was rationally related to the state objective sought to be achieved. The court held that the interest sought to be advanced was the alleviation of the insurance crisis by reducing medical malpractice claims, thereby reducing medical malpractice insurance rates, resulting in health care being more accessible to patients at reasonable costs. The court therefore found that &sect; 9:5628 bore a rational relationship to the state's interest in reducing the costs of health care to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lessor sought to recover past due rental payments on a copy machine. An ad hoc judge granted the lessee's motion for a directed verdict and dismissed the lessor's claim. The court reversed. On appeal, the lessor argued that the &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge was without authority to decide the case because his appointment pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:2561.9 was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, ruling that the statute's constitutionality could not be considered on appeal. Explaining, the court stated that the rights and duties of a judge de facto could only be inquired into by suit to which he was a party. The court then ruled that the trial judge erred in dismissing the lessor's claim on the basis that a lease agreement was not proven. Because the lessee admitted in its answer to lessor's suit that it had a lease-purchase agreement, lessee was bound, under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2291, to its judicial confession, which constituted proof of the lease agreement. Due to the dismissal, the lessee did not have an opportunity in support of its defense to prove that the machine was defective, which was why it halted its rental payments. Resolution of this issue was required on remand.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs filed an action for a declaratory judgment that the veto and order were null and void and for a writ of mandamus ordering defendants to make the appropriations. The trial court held that the veto and order were void, but denied the request for a mandamus. The court reversed, holding that the executive order did not violate La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of simple burglary and was sentenced to eight years at hard labor on each count. Defendant did not object to his sentence at the time of sentencing.

Civ. Code Ann. art. 139.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife filed a divorce action against the ex-husband after he was convicted of a felony and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment at hard labor. The district court subsequently granted a divorce &quot;a vinculo matrimonii&quot; based on the grounds set forth in La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 139. The court affirmed the judgment. Specifically, the court held that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 139, which set forth the grounds for divorce, was not unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of church and state because every state had the power to determine the status of inhabitant, marital or otherwise. Furthermore, the court found that the ex-husband's entry of a guilty plea to the felony was tantamount to a conviction for the commission of that crime for purposes of art. 139, thus, it was not error to grant the ex-wife a divorce based on the ex-husband's conviction. Finally, the court held that the district court correctly refused to appoint an attorney to represent the ex-husband in the civil proceeding because under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 5251(1), the ex-husband was clearly a resident of the state where he was incarcerated in a state penitentiary.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the record indicated that the trial judge made finding as required under the sentencing guidelines found in La. Code Crim. Proc.

An incomplete record as to the factors considered did not provide a basis to overturn a sentence as excessive if enough information was present in the record to demonstrate the trial judge was not arbitrary in imposing the sentence, and considered the nature of the offense, the character of the offender, and the need for protection of the public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In denying the former wife permanent alimony the trial court found that she failed to show that she was free from fault as required by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160. The court found that the only testimony tending to show legal fault on the former wife's part concerned her refusal to follow her former husband when he changed domiciles. This failure ran afoul of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 120 requiring that a wife live with her husband and follow him wherever he chose to reside. The former wife contended that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 120 was unconstitutional and also that she was free from fault. The court found La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 120&nbsp;unconstitutional in that it discriminated against women on the sole basis of gender by arbitrarily forcing them to follow husbands wherever they chose to live, in clear violation of equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. As the former wife's unwillingness to live with her husband and to follow him was the solitary reason she was denied permanent alimony, the court reversed the district court decree and remanded with instructions to schedule another hearing and determine the amount, if any, of permanent alimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled and set aside the judgment of the district court denying the former wife the right to seek alimony and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature adopted 1978 La. Acts 690 which amended La. Rev. Stat.

When the Commission began expropriation proceedings in another parish, the landowner brought a declaratory judgment action in the East Baton Rouge Parish trial court to have the Act declared unconstitutional. On review from an adverse judgment, the court dismissed the appeal, finding that it did not have a viable issue for review. The court reasoned that the underlying expropriation proceeding conferred jurisdiction over a sister circuit court of appeal and that advisory opinions were not permitted under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 40 years on his rape conviction, 30 years on the burglary conviction with the charges to run concurrently, and 10 years on the crime against nature conviction to run consecutively to his other sentences. Defendant challenged his sentences on the grounds that they were excessive. The appeals court affirmed. The court held that a sentence was considered excessive if it was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime, or was nothing more than the needless imposition of pain and suffering. The court noted that defendant's actions were brutal, violent, demeaning, prolonged and performed repeatedly over a several hour period. The maximum sentences for the forcible rape and aggravated burglary convictions were justified by these circumstances and the fact that defendant was a first-time offender and was briefly employed at the time of the offense did little to mitigate the atrocity of the crimes. In addition, the nature of the offenses, the violence displayed therein by defendant and his apparent lack of remorse indicated dangerous propensities on his part, which pose a risk to public safety. Consecutive sentences were justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State agents discovered defendant in a patch of marijuana. Defendant was charged by a bill of information with the production of marijuana.

After all 12 jurors had been selected in the second trial, a juror reported that he had spoken to one of defendant's accomplices after the arrest. The trial court declared a mistrial. A third trial resulted in defendant's conviction. The court affirmed. Defendant had not been placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense. The choosing of 6 jurors out of 12 in the first trial was not sufficient to trigger the attachment of jeopardy. Jeopardy had clearly attached after the mistrial was declared in the second trial; however, defendant's silence was a consent to the mistrial order. Defendant's claim that his right to a speedy trial was violated lacked merit; the length of the delay was not inordinate, the reasons for the delay did not indicate a purposeful attempt on the State's part to prejudice defendant or delay the trial, and defendant had not shown that he was prejudiced by the 19-month delay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Surgery was performed on the patient by the physician in 1976. In 1980 the patient discovered that t piece of metal had been negligently left in his hand.

The court rejected the argument and affirmed, holding that the argument ignored the plain meaning of the statute. The court reasoned that under &sect;9:5628, a claim had to be filed within one year of discovery but no later than three years after the negligent act. The court also found that the statute did not unconstitutionally deny the patient access to the courts because a malpractice action was not a fundamental right and the state had a rational basis for limiting malpractice actions.</SPAN></P>

The parties again separated in January 1980 and were divorced on May 29 of that year. The ex-wife filed a petition for partition of the property acquired by the parties between 1972 and their divorce, particularly the family home, stock in the corporate business conducted by the ex-husband, and other assets. The trial court rejected the ex-wife's demands to be recognized as the owner of an undivided one-half interest in and for a partition of property allegedly belonging to the community which existed between her and her ex-husband, or allegedly owned in indivision by the parties. The court held that the evidence did not establish that ex-wife and ex-husband agreed or consented to engage in a partnership or joint venture.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners succeeded in obtaining a judgment to annul and void a tax sale of their property to the purchaser. On appeal, the purchaser argued that it was error for the district court not to give retroactive effect to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2184. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that &sect; 47:2184, which prohibited the tax collector from dividing an owner's property into smaller quantities for sale than that contained in the description of the property, was not retroactively applicable to the present case because it was a substantive law that would effectively deprive the owners of their vested property rights to bring their action to annul the tax sale as provided for in the Louisiana Constitution. Furthermore, the court found that the failure of the tax collector to determine whether or not the property subject to sale was divisible in kind, and the failure to offer only a specific portion of the whole for sale to satisfy delinquent taxes rendered the sale a nullity.</SPAN></P>

The attorney claimed that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1873, which had a residency requirement, violated the city home rule charter, which did not, and, therefore, did not apply. The trial court held, to the contrary, that &sect; 13:1873 did not violate the structure, the organization, nor the distribution and redistribution of the powers and functions of the local governmental subdivision, and that La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25 indicates that whatever limitations may be found in La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 are inapplicable to laws affecting the courts and their officers. The trial court reasoned that, if the legislature could abolish a city court, it surely can establish the qualifications to run for that office. The court held that the power of the legislature transcended that of the parish and city home rule charters. Therefore, the residency requirement of two years, set by the legislature, was applicable, and the attorney, having become an elector of the city only five weeks before the election, was not qualified to be a candidate in the election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's succession was opened and a judgment of possession was signed and filed in 1980, but before the Louisiana Supreme Court held that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919 was unconstitutional in prohibiting acknowledged natural children from inheriting intestate from their father when the father had other relatives. Thereafter, the tutrix filed suit to reopen the succession, alleging that she represented the decedent's acknowledged illegitimate offspring. Reversing the trial court judgment, which sustained peremptory exceptions of no cause of action and prescription and dismissed the suit, the court held that the unconstitutional statute did not bar the suit because the Supreme Court decision was retroactive to 1975. Accepting the allegations of the petition as true, the petition stated a cause of action. Although the birth certificate and baptismal certificate filed in evidence by the tutrix did not satisfy the requirements of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 203 (1979) and the child would have to prove his filiation to the decedent pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 209, a filiation suit was not prescribed because it was brought within the grace period provided in 1981 La. Acts 720.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, 59 engineers employed with the Department of Transportation and Development, sought review of a decision from defendant Department of State Civil Service Commission (Commission) (Louisiana), denying their petition for correction and determination of pay scales that sought pay parity with engineers employed at other state agencies under a statewide unified pay plan authorized by La. Civ. Serv. R. 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The engineers argued that the unified pay plan adopted by the Commission eight years earlier had been inadequately implemented, resulting in pay disparity between comparable levels of state engineers and de facto discrimination. The Commission interpreted La. Civ. Serv. R. 6.12 as permitting employees to be demoted during the implementation of a new pay range as long as no reduction in salary occurred and decided that the governor's approval of a partial pay plan implementation, occasioned by an inadequate state budget, was not unconstitutional. On appeal, the court disagreed. The purpose of the classified civil servant system was to achieve parity between state employees based upon longevity of service. Partial implementation of the pay plan failed to achieve that goal. La. Civ. Serv. R. 6.12 unconstitutionally created pay inequities that rewarded state employees who had the shortest longevity while penalizing those with the greatest longevity. The governor acted unconstitutionally by only partially approving the pay plan under La. Civ. Serv. R. 6.2, which authorized him only to accept or reject the pay plan in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded to the Commission with orders to conduct further proceedings to revise the unified pay plan to effectuate parity between plaintiff engineers and engineers employed by other state agencies and to fully implement the plan as to all state employees who had not yet received the parity benefits of the plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the illegitimate children of their deceased father, sought to be recognized as his heirs. The 10th Judicial District Court, Parish of Natchitoches (Louisiana), rendered judgment recognizing them as the deceased's illegitimate children, and, as such, they were entitled to a proportionate share of his succession. Appellant, the deceased's widow and legitimate children, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues were: (1) whether the Louisiana Supreme Court's decision in Succession of Brown, declaring La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919&nbsp;unconstitutional, had to be applied retroactively; and (2) whether the illegitimate children proved filiation within the time limits prescribed. The record showed that the deceased died intestate on November 7, 1975. Therefore, the appellate court held that the illegitimate children, having proved their filiation, were entitled to a pro rata share in the estate of their father. That was notwithstanding the fact that he died some 5 years prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Brown, unless it was established that the illegitimate children failed to make such proof within the time limits prescribed by the legislature. The illegitimate children filed suit on July 9, 1981, well within the 1 year grace period, and they were over 19 years of age at that time. Thus, if 1980 La. Acts 549 &sect; 4 was to be given a literal interpretation, it had to have been concluded that the illegitimate children's suit was timely filed. As 1980 La. Acts 549 &sect; 4 was intended to benefit illegitimates, the illegitimate children were entitled to a pro rata share of the estate.</SPAN></P>

The father was married to another woman when the children were conceived. The father signed the acknowledgment on December 10, 1976, admitting that three illegitimate children were his. The trial court dismissed the suit, on the ground that former LA. Civ. Code Ann. art. 204 (Repealed 1979) prohibited the acknowledgment by the father, as he and the mother were incapable of marriage at the time of conception. The trial court concluded that the acknowledgment was invalid. The appellate court found that: (1) former LA. Civ. Code Ann. art. 204 (Repealed 1979) was unconstitutional, because it created an invidious discrimination, which was barred by LA. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974); (2) the declaration herein, that former LA. Civ. Code Ann. art. 204 (Repealed 1979) was unconstitutional, was retroactive to January 1, 1975, the effective date of the 1974 Louisiana Constitution; thus, (3) the father's acknowledgment was valid, and the trial court erred in dismissing the mother's suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A convenience store operator applied for a license to sell beer at its store in Many (Louisiana), but the mayor and board of alderman denied the license, as they concluded that the store was located within 300 feet of a building that was used as a training center for retarded citizens and that the training center qualified as a school under Town of Many, La., Ordinances &sect; 8. At the time the application was denied, a landowner who rented a building to the organization that operated the training center was renovating a nearby building and planned to rent that building to the organization, but had not done so. The trial court measured the distance between the building that was occupied and the convenience store, and it concluded that the distance was more than 300 feet. The appellate court held that the trial court properly decided that the measurement between the training center and the convenience store had to be taken from the building that was occupied, not the building under renovation, and correctly ordered the Town to issue the license based on its determination that the distance between the training center and the convenience store was more than 300 feet.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pled guilty to the offense of a simple crime against nature, in violation of La. Rev. Stat.

A psychiatrist recommended probation, but the trial court imposed a sentence of five years' imprisonment, the maximum period of imprisonment authorized by law. The appellate court held that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ignoring the psychiatrist's recommendation, because evidence showed that the recommendation was based on only one interview and that defendant had not told the psychiatrist about other crimes he committed; and (2) evidence that showed that defendant engaged in similar unlawful conduct in the past, had a juvenile record, committed his crime upon a victim of a tender age, and had already been afforded leniency when he was allowed to plead guilty to a lesser offense was sufficient to sustain the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred in maintaining the peremptory exception of no right of action filed by the wife, individually and as administratrix, and dismissing the action. The court held that a case, which declared unconstitutional a statute that prohibited illegitimate children from inheriting from their father, was applicable retroactively to January 1, 1975. The court applied the case retroactively to the putative children's action because the decedent died on January 14, 1979, the wife was not a third person, and the succession was intestate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sued to recover benefits, alleging that he was totally and permanently disabled as a result of injuries suffered in a work-related accident.

The trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the claimant for total and permanent disability, ordering the insurer to pay benefits for the period of his disability and any medical bills. The insurer contended that the trial court committed manifest error in finding the claimant to have been totally and permanently disabled. The claimant answered, complaining of the trial court's failure to award him statutory penalties and attorney's fees. The court reversed and held that the insurer properly terminated benefits when the claimant became gainfully employed in work similar to that he was performing at the time he was injured. Under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband acquired four tracts of land in partition of his father's succession between him and his co-heirs, but the deeds were in the form of sales and recited cash contributions. On appeal of the trial court's finding that the tracts were not community property, the wife argued that the property was irrebutably presumed to be community property without the double declaration that the property was acquired with the husband's separate funds and that it was being acquired for his individual estate. In affirming, the court acknowledged that a judicial interpretation of former La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 2334 and 2402 required the double declaration to avoid the irrebutable presumption but ruled that the requirement did not apply to partitions of succession property. The court held that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2340 abrogated the rule by permitting the presumption to be rebutted and that art. 2340 was procedural and could be applied retroactively to allow the husband to introduce evidence of the nature of the acts as partitions of a succession.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband appealed a judgment that made past due alimony pendente lite that he owed his wife executory and ordered him to pay costs and attorney's fees. The husband contended as his only assignment of error that the trial court erred in awarding the unpaid and past due alimony pendente lite because in making the award, the trial court erroneously enforced an unconstitutional judgment awarding alimony pendente lite. The husband argued that because his assertion of unconstitutionality had not been finally adjudicated, the judgment awarding alimony pendente lite was not enforceable. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment in all respects. The court held that La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3943, which provided for no suspensive appeal from an alimony award, was a reasonable and valid legislative restriction on the right of judicial review which was necessary in order that a spouse could be provided support during the pendency of an appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Carroll, Louisiana, which was entered on a jury verdict convicting him of malfeasance in office in violation of La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a chief of police, was charged with making false statements in an unsworn affidavit and orally in the course of obtaining a warrant from the mayor for the arrest of a police officer for disturbing the peace at a junior high school in violation of a town ordinance. In reversing defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element of the crimes charged. The conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:126.1 was not proved because there was no proof that defendant made false statements. Defendant's affidavit accurately reported that the police officer came to the school for the purpose of discussing an affair that his wife, a teacher, was allegedly having with the principal, and the affidavit noted the frightened reaction of school personnel. Further, the police officer's alleged violation of a municipal ordinance did not concern the commission of &quot;crime.&quot; The State also failed to prove that defendant intentionally performed a duty lawfully required of him in an unlawful manner pursuant to La.

The State appealed the Commission's decision on its own behalf and own behalf of the employee. On appeal, the court vacated the part of the Commission's decision that declared &sect; 42:1451&nbsp;unconstitutional because the Commission lacked authority to declare state statutes unconstitutional. The court determined that the function of interpreting the constitution and laws of the state rested exclusively upon the courts. The court found that the Commission committed manifest error by refusing to apply the provisions of &sect; 42:1451 and denying attorney fees to the employee. However, the court dismissed the appeal with respect to whether just cause existed for the employee's reprimand because the attorney general had no right of action to raise the matter on appeal. Pursuant to La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, the court determined that the attorney general was without authority to appeal the employee's reprimand because no right or interest of the State was aggrieved by the Commission's affirmance of the employee's reprimand.</SPAN></P>

She alleged that his motion for a new trial was not filed within the required three days and that the notice of appeal was not filed within the required ten days. The court amended the judgment from the trial court and reduced the award for back wages and increased the award for attorney's fees. The court found that they had agreed that she would not be paid for sick leave and that she would be allowed to make up any time lost due to sickness. At the time that she resigned, the court found that she had not made up all of her sick time. The court approved the award of attorney's fees because he should have paid the amount of wages for which there was no dispute. The court held that the delay in filing the required notices was because of the failure of the employer to receive notice as to the signing of the judgments.</SPAN></P>

The board contended that the trial court erroneously overruled its peremptory exception of no cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a lengthy litigation that was brought by 35 landowners seeking relief and damages for the construction of levees as part of the flood control plan. The board claimed that the landowners had no cause of action under existing law because the petition failed to state that the property was assessed for taxes the preceding year. The court amended the judgment to delete interest on attorney's fees and reduced the awards for severance damages. The court affirmed the amended judgment. The court noted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5111 did not provide for interest on attorneys' fees. The court noted that the amended petition cured the earlier failure to state a cause of action. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing a grant of continuance despite the withdrawal of one of the board's attorneys four weeks prior to trial. The court stated that La. Code Civ. Procedure Ann. art. 1601 provided a trial court with great discretion in determining whether to grant a continuance. The court also upheld the ruling that a change in statutes did not affect the landowners' rights to be paid a fair market value for their property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought a building permit for a mobile home park on a 7.4 acre tract of land that he owned in the town.

The trial court found that the zoning ordinance which preceded the one at issue prohibited the mobile home park, as did the ordinance at issue. The owner appealed. The court held that the ordinance at issue was improperly promulgated and was therefore null and void.

He was re-employed by the railroad and continued to work for about six months when he was terminated. The termination letter stated that he was erroneously allowed to return to work. The trial court awarded him a year's pay plus attorney's fees. The court affirmed. The court found that the FELA was within the scope of laws designated in La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court denied appellants' request for a preliminary injunction to enjoin appellees from implementing 1982 La. Acts 352 (the Act), which replaced the administrative agency that oversaw a park and which transferred administrative jurisdiction over the park to a state department; appellants argued the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held that the Act was constitutional and denied appellants' request for a preliminary injunction. The district court also severed as unconstitutional &sect; 1766(A) of the Act, which provided the city would pay a certain sum to the park. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Because the State owned the park, it had every right to administer the park in whatever manner was in the State's best interest. That the State had previously administered the park through municipal agencies did not confer ownership of the property on the municipality. Insofar as the Act changed the composition of the Board of Commissioners, it was not a local or special law. However, the district court should also have declared unconstitutional the concluding sentence of &sect; 3(E)(2) of the Act, which required the city to spend its own funds for the benefit of the park. Section 3(E)(2) was inconsistent with the city's home rule charter, and it was also clearly a local or special law that had not been published pursuant to La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 13. The court severed the concluding sentence of &sect; 3(E)(2) from the Act and upheld the rest of the Act as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Civil Service Commission of the City of New Orleans appealed a judgment of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which upheld the constitutionality of 1980 La. Acts 690 (Act), which amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:255 and 15:256. The Commission argued that the Act conflicted with La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10(A)(1). The State argued that the Act was supplemental and required payments of fees not compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original &sect;&sect; 15:255 and 15:256 gave discretion to the City of New Orleans to enact a plan for payment of witness fees to off-duty law enforcement officers who testified in court. On appeal, the court held that the Act could be interpreted to require the Commission to adopt a plan to pay fees in addition to the existing time and one-half pay or it could be interpreted to preempt the Commission's pay plan and substitute the statutory fee plan. While it was true that a statute enjoyed a presumption in favor of its constitutionality, when a statute conflicted with a constitutional provision, the statute had to fall. The court held that art. X, &sect; 10(A)(1) vested the Commission with the exclusive powers to regulate the classified service in matters of compensation disbursements to classified employees, including police officers. If the Act were interpreted to require the Commission to adopt a plan for payment of witness fees, it enlarged the Commission's constitutionally limited scope of authority. Given its holding, the City of New Orleans was excluded from the application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:256, as amended, so the court did not consider the constitutionality of &sect; 15:256.</SPAN></P>

Further, the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 402 precluded any state court from reordering the distribution of federal social security benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Specific performance of a contract between plaintiff and defendant husband for a one-year option to buy certain immovable property was sought. The First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) sustained defendant wife's exception of no cause of action and rejected plaintiff's demands against her, holding that the option was invalid. Plaintiff and the husband urged reversal of the district court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contention that the contract was void because the husband and plaintiff breached fiduciary obligations owed to the wife had not addressed the petition's allegations, instead, it was a factual allegation of a possible defense. As such, the contention had not supported an exception of no cause of action. Another ground set out was that the option was void for lack of consideration. The option was granted in a contract of lease that provided sufficient consideration for an option to purchase. Therefore, this contention was not a basis for sustaining the exception. It was also contended that the option was void for inspecificity as to payment terms. Yet, the contract provided for payment of a stated determined purchase price. The contract's failure to specify payment terms simply meant full payment in cash. The contention that the option was invalid because the repealed La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2404, which gave the husband authority to enter the option contract, was unconstitutional. Yet, the contract was entered into on September 28, and on December 12, art. 2404 was held unconstitutional. The unconstitutionality of repealed art. 2404 should not have been given retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the district court erred in sustaining the exception of no cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor's privileges were suspended after she threatened to finance a patient's lawsuit against the hospital, and numerous nurses were threatening to resign because of her conduct. After refusing to comply with conditions for her return, she applied for privileges and was denied, prompting her suit. Her petition for a preliminary injunction was denied, and the denial was affirmed. In the subsequent trial, after three weeks, with only testimony from the doctor and her accountant left in her case, she failed to appear after attempting suicide. Her attorney opposed a continuance and moved for a mistrial. The district court ordered dismissal with prejudice, and after a remand, held a hearing and re-entered the same judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the district court should have treated the doctor's motion as one for voluntary dismissal under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1671. In response to such a motion, the district court had discretion to order dismissal with prejudice. The court found no abuse of discretion because the doctor had failed to prove her case due to a lack of sufficient evidence, and further proceedings would not substantiate her claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer's letter of dismissal listed several incidents dating over six years, which purportedly formed the basis for his dismissal by the Superintendent of Police. Those incidents included civil lawsuits in which the officer was a party defendant, along with the City of New Orleans. The subject letter indicated that the officer was terminated as a result of the various incidents listed therein and violations of the police department's regulations. The Civil Service Commission found that the city, as the appointing authority, failed to carry the burden of proof as to the charges leveled against the officer. The city claimed the commission erred in finding no legal cause for his dismissal. The court found the commission's findings well-articulated and affirmed the judgment of the commission, reversing the officer's dismissal. The court noted that, at the hearing before the commission, the city did not intend to get into the specifics of each and every complaint. The court found that the city not only failed to carry its burden of proving any of the incidents listed, but failed to show any misconduct or neglect of duty sufficient to sustain the officer's dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation (the department) assessed tax in the amount of $ 250,841 against the corporation. From that assessment, the corporation appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals, which affirmed. The district court also affirmed. On review, the corporation argued that the assessment was in error. According to the corporation, it properly followed an accounting procedure recognized by federal law that permitted it to establish a new type of corporation known as a domestic international sales corporation (DISC). The court disagreed that the accounting procedure applied to state income taxes. According to the court, because Louisiana had no comparable provision reducing the income tax on corporations engaged primarily in the export of goods, the Secretary of the Department of Revenue and Taxation was well within the statutory authority of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:95 when she reallocated the accumulated DISC income. Further, the court held that the corporation's constitutional attacks upon &sect; 47:95 were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court rejected the husband's adultery-based demand for a divorce after excluding the evidence of the wife's abortion. The court set aside that judgment, with the exception of ruling on a rehearing that not showing changed circumstances or other claims required that a support award not be modified, and remanded the action for the consideration of the excluded evidence, which the husband's completely effective vasectomy made relevant. The court reasoned that the wife waived her statutory privilege under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3734B and her federal right to privacy by demanding a separation, by testifying that she was free from fault, and by claiming an ultimate entitlement to post-divorce alimony based on that alleged innocence. The court also held that not allowing the husband to respond to the wife's claim was inequitable. The court further found that denying the husband's request to admit the recordings of the telephone conversations was proper because only one tape purported to contradict a witness, and that was on an irrelevant point, and that the wife admitted to being upset when she made another recorded statement that the husband sought to admit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review of a judgment from First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), rendered in consolidated separation and divorce actions. The husband sought review of the judgment insofar as it awarded appellee wife alimony pendente lite and permanent alimony and insofar as it enjoined the husband from alienating, encumbering, or disposing of any assets belonging to the former community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that the trial court erred in making an excessive award of alimony pendente lite and in making the award retroactive to the date of judicial demand. Because the divorce was granted contemporaneously with the retroactive award of alimony pendente lite, the court held that the husband's assignment of error was moot. The court rejected the husband's contention that the court's denial of review violated his right to judicial review under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19. The court held that the legislative restriction on judicial review of alimony awards under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3943 was reasonable and valid. The court also rejected the husband's assertion that the trial court unconstitutionally applied La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 148. Regarding the trial court's award of permanent alimony, the court found that the award exceeded the limitation in La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160. Therefore, the court amended the judgment to reduce the award to the correct amount. The court also amended the judgment to delete the paragraph that provided for an injunction, finding that the wife made no showing of irreparable injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surety appealed from Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge's (Louisiana) dismissal of its action in which it sought a declaration that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:84 was unconstitutional. The surety contended that &sect; 15:84 deprived sureties of procedural due process because it did not provide notice to a surety of a criminal defendant's reassigned appearance date and allowed forfeiture in the absence of notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A surety challenged the constitutional validity of &sect; 15:84, which regulated the forfeiture of bail bonds in city, parish, and juvenile courts. The surety argued that its due process rights were violated by both the difference between the bond forfeiture procedures in district and city courts and by the failure to require that notice be given to a surety of the rescheduling of a defendant's appearance date. In affirming the trial court's judgment that &sect; 15:84 was constitutional, the court found that: (1) the surety had no basis for its claim that bond forfeitures must be treated in the same manner in the courts of limited jurisdiction as in the district courts; (2) the distinction between the notice procedure was entirely rational on the grounds that it was simply impracticable to give written notice in misdemeanor cases and that sureties received initial notice in felony cases; and (3) La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 337 provided that notice of reassignment of a new appearance date in a district court or a court of limited jurisdiction need not be given to a surety because it had a full opportunity to determine the new date from public records and to protect its interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the surety's declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The district court declared the contested portions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1427 to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three troopers were former municipal police officers and one was a former noncommissioned officer with the Department of Public Safety, who had been rehired as a commissioned officer. Plaintiffs challenged La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1427(B)(1), (2), (3) and its amendments that limited the amount of retirement system credits that could be purchased for prior service on municipal police departments, withdrew such an opportunity for former noncommissioned officers, and denied the purchase of credits for summer and weekend service in the reserves and National Guard. The district court held such did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and rejected the claim by the former noncommissioned officer of equitable estoppel. On appeal the court affirmed. The court ruled the troopers' rights were not vested and thus subject to legislative amendment until they were eligible for retirement, and that &sect; 40:1427(B)(1), (2), (3), as legitimate acts for improving actuarial integrity, were constitutional and valid. The court ruled that &sect; 40:1427(B)(2) properly prevented a double credit, and that equitable estoppel could not prevail over the positive written law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who was employed by the actual employer as a pipefitter welder, was working at a chemical plant owned by the statutory employer. The actual employer had entered into a contract with the statutory employer to convert an existing ethanol unit to production of isopropanol. While the employee was welding a flange on a gas line in order to install a metering device, a seal plug, which had been inserted in the line to isolate a section thereof, blew out causing severe injuries to his left arm and shoulder. He brought an action against defendants and a worker's compensation carrier intervened. Defendants in turn brought a third party action against the actual employer and two insurers seeking indemnification. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of defendants and the third-party defendants. The employee, the carrier, and defendants all sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that an employee of a contractor could not maintain a tort action against the contractor's principal for an accident that occurred during the course of work that was a part of the principal's business because his exclusive remedy was in workers' compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a suit for the annulment of an adoption. The parents contended that the statute of repose was designed to remedy minor procedural defects and not to cure absolute nullities that arose from the failure to follow basic substantive requirements of the law. The court found La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:440 to be entirely clear. The court found that &quot;for any reason&quot; meant what it said, and that it was now too late for the parents to seek the nullity of the adoption, assuming that the proceedings were, in fact, absolutely null for the reasons stated. The parents also contended that they were entitled to the benefit of the doctrine contra non valentem agere, nulla currit praescriptio. They contended that they believed they could do nothing until they knew the whereabouts of their child, and that the one-year period of prescription or peremption prescribed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:440 did not begin to run until that time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased officer was killed in the line of duty on his third day on the job, and he was not receiving state compensation at the time of his death. The district court held that he did not fall within the class of &quot;law enforcement officer&quot; so as to entitle his survivors to benefits under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2201. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 33:2201 was unambiguously limited to officers to whom &quot;state compensation was or could be paid,&quot; that La. Rev. Stat.

The court rejected those arguments. Terms were clearly defined, provided fair notice of what conduct was prohibited, and there was a rational relationship to the state's interest of avoiding conflicts of interest without creating unnecessary barriers to public service. Sections 42:1111C, 1112B did not prohibit business dealings between state mineral lessees and legal entities in which the board member had a controlling interest. These sections were applicable to public servants. The board member could not be equated with his corporation under these sections.

The court stated that the general rule was that amendments to statutes of limitations, which reduced the time period for filing a suit, applied retroactively. The court rejected the insured's argument that retroactive application would impair his rights under the insurance contract. The court found that no vested right under the contract was impaired by the reduction of the limitations period.

The trial judge found that plaintiff was not granted a permit to construct the driveway and that the police jury acted within its police power to provide for the safety of the public. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the police jury found that there would be a hazardous situation caused by the location of the proposed driveway, and it acted within its police power to protect the safety of the traveling public by passing a resolution prohibiting construction of the driveway. The court reasoned that the resolution passed by the police jury was a valid exercise of its police power and was under authority granted it by legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans (Dock Board) and its members, appealed from a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which granted exceptions of prematurity and no right of action filed by defendant, the Commission on Ethics for Public Employees, and dismissed plaintiffs' suits to enjoin the Commission's investigation into the member's business affairs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission issued an opinion that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 42:111(C)(2)(d), 42:1116, part of the Code of Government Ethics (Code), applied to Board members. The Commission then commenced an investigation to determine if the members were involved in rendering services to those seeking business relationships with the Board, or in seeking contracts with entities regulated by the Board. In a trial on the exceptions, the district court excluded as hearsay an affidavit offered by the Board, then dismissed the member's suit as premature, and the Board's suit for no right of action. On appeal, the court held that the Code applied to the Board under La. Const. art. X, &sect; 21. The court found that the hearsay affidavits were not competent evidence thus were properly excluded under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 930, 931. The court held that the prematurity exception was properly granted because there had been no decision or exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court held that Board might have a right of action if enforcement of the Code made it impossible to appoint qualified members under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:1(A), thus it was premature to sustain that exception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court judgment which granted the exception of prematurity and reversed the judgment granting the exception of no right of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbors filed suit against the developer that sought to obtain a mandatory injunction against the developer to have the trial court declare the roadways and streets within the subdivision public, and the ownership thereof, vested in the public and to force the developer to reopen the entranceway, which had been relocated since the original plat was filed with the clerk of court. There were no allegations or proof that the agenda for the Police Jury was not duly posted and published or that newspaper advertisements were not published in accordance with the then prevailing requirements. The court found that the ordinance was presumed, as a matter of law, to be valid and constitutional unless competent evidence was adduced which demonstrated that the ordinance was so clearly arbitrary and capricious as to be unreasonable and oppressive. The court further found that the Police Jury, in accepting all of the streets and roadways into the road maintenance system and thereby acquiring title to the subsurface thereof, had rendered moot any issue with respect to the exercise of ownership of the substrata by the developer.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:4.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board member argued the school board's regulation, which prohibited the member's tape recording of executive sessions, was a prior restraint of speech. The court disagreed and stated the member remained free to disseminate any information entertained by the school board during their executive meetings limited only by his own discretion and the laws regarding defamation. The member also argued the school board's regulation was an unconstitutional abridgment of his right to gather information, as protected by the First Amendment. The court refused to give the member any special rights under the First Amendment over and above those which resided with the general public. Under Louisiana law, the school board's public meetings could be recorded; however, no such provision existed permitting the recordation of executive sessions. The court held the legislature's silence meant that each public body should have the prerogative to allow or prohibit tape recording at closed meetings. The court held that the school board's prohibition was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable and that it must be upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state employee was injured at work and received workmen's compensation. After appellee appointing authority reduced his paycheck by $ 223 pursuant to La. Civ. Serv. R. 11:21 to offset part of his workmen's compensation benefits in relation to the employee's &quot;buy-back&quot; of sick leave, the employee appealed the reduction. The Louisiana Civil Service Commission held that the appointing authority acted reasonably. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee first received workmen's compensation in May and June of 1978. Since the total of his compensation benefits and sick leave benefits exceeded his regular salary by the amount of his compensation benefits, he endorsed his compensation checks over to the appointing authority, thus &quot;buying back&quot; his sick leave. After June 6, 1978, the employee still received sick leave benefits, but his compensation benefits were discontinued. The employee later settled a workmen's compensation claim for $ 1,116, $ 223 of which went to his attorney as a contingency fee, and the remaining $ 892 was tendered to the appointing authority to &quot;buy back&quot; sick leave. The $ 223 was deducted from the employee's back pay. The Commission interpreted Rule 11:21 to require that an employee's gross workmen's compensation benefit be used in determining the amount to be tendered in buying back sick leave. The appellate court held that this interpretation was not unjust or unreasonable, as the attorney's fee was a debt of the employee and not the appointing authority's responsibility. Contrary to the employee's contention, Rule 11:21 did not deny equal protection, as it treated all employees equally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the Commission's determination, at the employee's cost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The levee district instituted appropriation proceedings under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 665 for the purpose of taking the landowners' property for a protection levee. Th landowners sued, claiming that their land was improperly taken. The trial court found in the levee district's favor, and the landowners appealed. The court held that art. 665 provides a servitude in favor of the public upon lands adjacent to navigable rivers and streams for the construction and maintenance of levees, and that the burden of proving the riparian character of the land as a prerequisite to acquiring the servitude fell upon the levee district. In addition, the court noted that the levee must be necessary for the control of flood waters from the river or stream to which the land is riparian. The court determined that in this case, the levee district proved the riparian nature of the tracts in question by the introduction of a survey map showing that at the time that the land was separated from the public domain, it was riparian. The court concluded that this created a servitude in favor of the public and, therefore, art. 665 was correctly used to appropriate the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant supermarkets appealed a judgment by the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, holding that La. Dairy Stabilization Board R. 12.9 was constitutional, ordering appellee, the Louisiana Dairy Stabilization Board, to grant licenses applied for prior to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:931.13D, and enjoining the supermarkets from selling milk products until assessments were paid. The Board appealed devolutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supermarkets argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:931.13D and its companion amendment to La. Dairy Stabilization Board R. 12.9 were unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the Board never attempted to collect the assessment from a retailer who purchased from an in-state processor. As the law was applied, the free flow of interstate commerce was discriminatorily burdened. The law resulted in local enterprises being favored at the expense of out-of-state businesses. Further, the law clearly circumvented a federal court ruling. The law only applied to retailers who dealt with processors who had not paid the assessment, which in all likelihood would always be out-of-state processors. The application of the law left a discriminatory difference between in-state retailers, depending upon whether they bought their dairy products from in-state processors or from out-of-state processors. The selective application of the statute constituted a discriminatory burden upon interstate commerce, in violation of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1. &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed insofar as it upheld the validity of La.

The trial court merged the hearing on the employees' motion to recall the temporary restraining order with a hearing on the merits of issuing a preliminary injunction. On the merits, the trial court enjoined the employees from carrying weapons on the strike line. On appeal, the court held that the employer had violated &sect; 23:844 by seeking the temporary restraining order without a hearing, without giving the employees 48 hours of its intent to seek injunctive relief, and without posting bond. The employer also failed to allege or prove that public officers charged with the duty of protecting the employer's property had failed or were unable to do so as required by &sect; 23:844(6).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker, a city employee, filed suit against the city, its insurer, the park commission, its unnamed insurer, and a co-worker for injuries suffered when he was attacked by the co-worker while the two of them were working for the park commission. His claims against the city and park commission were grounded on the doctrine of respondeat superior. Citing La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032, as amended by 1976 La. Acts 147, the city, its insurer, and the park commission filed exceptions of no cause of action based on the premise that the worker's exclusive remedy was a claim for workers' compensation. The trial court granted the exceptions and the court affirmed. The amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032 allowed a worker to sue a co-worker in tort for an intentional harm, but not the employer if the employer's only liability was based on a theory of respondeat superior. Workers' compensation was not to be the exclusive remedy, and the employer was to be subject to a fine or penalty under any other statute or the liability, civil or criminal, resulting from an intentional act only if the employer committed the intentional tort personally or caused it to be committed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion, and the illegitimate children appealed, arguing that because art. 919 had been found unconstitutional, the decision so holding should be applied retroactively and that their challenge should be allowed. The court disagreed, holding for policy reasons that judgments of possession which relied on the substantive law of art. 919 should not be declared invalid because such a holding would engender new litigation in every case where there had been justified reliance on the statute. The court held that the high court's declaration that art. 919 was unconstitutional should only be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Within a few minutes after the man suffered a heart attack, a city emergency vehicle manned by two firefighters arrived on the scene. They resumed cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rushed the man to the hospital. Although the man's heartbeat was restored, it was determined that he had suffered brain damage from a lack of oxygen. The man died from resulting medical complications. The man's surviving spouse and child filed a suit against the city and the two firemen for negligence in rendering emergency assistance to the man. The trial court dismissed the suit. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly ordered a bifurcated jury trial on the liability of the firemen and a bench trial on the city's liability pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105. The court found that the medical evidence supported the finding that the firemen were not grossly negligent. In connection with the claim against the city, the court could find no support in the record for a finding that the brain damage occurred after the arrival of the firemen or that improper CPR had been administered because of a lack of equipment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trainer and his brother were both licensed by the Commission to train racehorses. The trainer transferred three horses to his brother before they ran in separate races on the same day. Urine tests taken after each horse finished third determined that each had been doped with an amphetamine banned by the Commission's rules. The Commission held the trainer jointly accountable with his brother because the trainer directed overall stable operations. The trainer was suspended from racing horses at any state track for three years. The trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:150(A), which made a licensed trainer the &quot;absolute insurer&quot; of his horse's condition on race day regardless of the acts of third parties was constitutional because it was rationally related to achieving the public purpose of protecting the betting public. Section 4:155, which failed to set out specific penalties for violations of the Commission's rules, did not foster unequal application of the law but merely promoted flexibility in meting out punishment. Due to the trainer's record of past violations, the three-year suspension was not unduly harsh.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court held that La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court affirmed that judgment, holding that defendants were immune under art. 215 and that there was no liability under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2322 because the customer did not show how the alleged defect in the retailer's detection device damaged her. The court concluded that not removing the tag caused the damage and that the detection system defect merely delayed the damage's occurrence. The court also held that the immunity under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 215 applied because the detention and the search were reasonable in force and in duration and because it was irrelevant that the tag triggered a detection device in a store other than where it was purchased. The court further found that art. 215 did not violate La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5 because it did not authorize unreasonable searches or seizures.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court was not clearly wrong in concluding that the candidate neither abandoned nor lost his life-long Louisiana residence by his stay in New York, when, as the candidate testified, he always intended to return to Louisiana. The court found that the issue of residency depended primarily on the intent of the individual. The court held that the candidate's move to New York, where he registered to vote, did not preclude him from continuing to be a resident of Louisiana because a change in voter registration for the candidate was not a momentous matter.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the wife could not challenge the constitutionality of art. 141 because she had not raised the issue in the trial court. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to increase the father's child support obligation because there was no evidence that the child had been subjected to a lower standard of living than he would have had if he had been living with his father. The court found that the denial of the wife's claim for attorney's fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:305 was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two oil companies brought suit against a school board and others, representing that when they made purchases of fuel oil, a sales tax was collected on the transactions for the school board under its ordinance of July 14, 1965, under the authority of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2737 and &sect; 47:301. The oil companies contended that they were not subject to the tax because they were not consumers or retailers and the fuel oil was in turn sold by them to others as wholesalers or distributors. They demanded a refund of the taxes from the school board. The school board filed exceptions of no cause of action in each suit, and the trial judge maintained the exceptions and dismissed the suits. On review, the court affirmed that the oil companies had not sufficiently alleged that they were entitled to a refund of sale taxes imposed because they did not show, as was required by the ordinance, that they protested the taxes at the time they were due. However, the court remanded the cases so that each oil company could amend for the limited purpose of providing evidence of a timely protest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner boarded up his property after extensive renovation and destruction done to the property. The owner did not pay property taxes on the property for six years, and liens were filed against the property. On June 19, 1978, plaintiff sought an injunction to restrain the city from demolishing the property. Negotiations took place on settling the suit, but after expiration of the temporary restraining order, the city began demolishing the property. The owner contended that the liens were authorized and that the city breached an agreement not to demolish the property. The court held that the owner failed to prove an agreement existed. Testimony from an assistant district attorney established that any agreement was between the owner's attorney and two other district attorneys, and that if they agreed that the property should not be demolished, so did he. The owner's attorney did not testify that the agreement was with the assistant, and no explanation was given for failure to call the other district attorneys in court. The owner failed to show that the liens were unconstitutionally or improperly placed upon the property, and therefore failed to show an illegal demolition.</SPAN></P>

From a judgment in favor of the firefighters, the commission and the city appealed. On review, the court noted that the question of whether a city civil service commission was mandated to include the state supplement in computing a fireman's overtime benefits was one of first impression. The court found that the legislature, in its wisdom, had seen fit to supplement the compensation of firemen. The constitution and laws of the State of Louisiana recognized the necessity of increasing firemen's wages to protect the public. Under these circumstances, the court reasoned that the rule-making authority of the civil service commission should not be interpreted to thwart these expressed desires to further the public need.</SPAN></P>

In reversing in part, the court ruled that, although &sect; 42:261E did not unconstitutionally preclude access to the courts, it was limited in use and application by public officials and that the parish police jury was not a public official.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A leasing company's business was to lease automobiles for periods in excess of six months. The company did not maintain a fleet, but purchased each automobile simultaneously with the obtaining of a new lease. The company retained title, but the lessee's name and address were reflected on each registration. The parish school board, by summary proceeding, sought to compel the leasing company to pay a two- percent tax on the leases. The trial court denied recovery, characterizing the simultaneous sale-lease as one taxable transaction. On appeal, the court noted that the State collected no tax on the long term leasing of vehicles by virtue of an exemption granted by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305.23. However, the court noted that this exemption did not affect the taxation powers of local authorities. Because no express tax provision dealt with this matter, the court found that the trial court was justified in resorting to the state code to reach an equitable result. Because it was equitable only to tax the sale and not the lease transaction, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the owners' arguments that &sect; 30:12, La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:2(5), which governed expropriation actions, were unconstitutionally broad. The commissioner's findings could inform a court as to whether expropriation was necessary for a public purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an appeal in consolidated expropriation suits brought by a pipeline company against certain landowners. The trial court heard and passed on the right of the pipeline company to expropriate a twelve-inch gas line across the properties at issue. After the pipeline was constructed, the second phase of the trial was conducted to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded to the landowners. On review, the landowners contended that the uses of natural gas delivered through the pipeline did not meet the public purpose test under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. In support of this contention, the landowners urged that the pipeline would not serve any interest located in the area of expropriation, but would instead serve some industries 100 or more miles from the location of the pipeline. The landowners argued that industries and individuals outside the immediate area of expropriation did not constitute the public for purposes of the public purpose test. Affirming the decision below, the court concluded that this construction of the term public was extremely narrow and was contrary to Louisiana jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured driver and passengers brought an action for damages against the other driver and her insurer when they suffered injuries in a car accident. They later filed an amended petition adding the underinsured motorist insurer as a defendant. The underinsured motorist insurer flied an exception of prescription, which the district court sustained. The injured driver and passengers appealed their dismissal. The court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5629, which provided that actions for the recovery of damages brought pursuant to uninsured motorist provisions were prescribed by two years from the date of the accident, became effective July 1, 1978. The court found that the accident occurred on April 1, 1978, but that the action against the underinsured motorist insurer was not filed until August 21, 1980. The court held that the provisions of &sect; 9:5629 applied retroactively such that the cause of action filed against the underinsured motorist insurer was untimely in that it prescribed on April 21, 1980. The court found that the one year and 10 months in which the injured driver and passengers had to file their action was a reasonable period of time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incident that gave rise to this litigation occurred when a man was killed when a trench in which he was digging collapsed. The incident occurred within the course and scope of the man's employment. His wife brought suit against his employer and a supervisory employee, asserting intentional as well as negligent acts. Defendants filed a peremptory exception of no cause of action, on the ground that the wife's exclusive remedy was in workmen's compensation. The trial court sustained the exception. On review, the court noted that, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032, an employee's, or his dependent's, remedy was limited to workmen's compensation unless the injury or death was caused by an intentional act. The court concluded that, in this case, there was no well-pleaded factual allegation of an intentional act that caused the accident and death of the employee. There was no fact in the pleadings to indicate that either defendant entertained a desire to bring about the results obtained or should have believed that the results were substantially certain to follow anything they did, or did not do.</SPAN></P>

She argued that her post separation earnings were exempt from seizure due to the separation of property agreement executed by the wife and the husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realty company employed the law firm for legal services. Subsequently, the husband, as president of the realty company, and individually, signed a note to settle a claim for attorney's fees. The law firm obtained a judgment against the realty company and the husband. The judgment was made executory, and the trial court ordered that the floral shop, as garnishee, pay to the law firm 25 percent of the wife's disposable earnings. The couple separated thereafter, and the wife appealed dismissal of her motion to discontinue the garnishment. The court held that although the judgment of garnishment was rendered against the wife before she and her husband became separate in property, both their separation and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2357 came into effect at the same time. The provisions of this statute were remedial and were subject to retroactive application. Thus, the court found that the application of the statute did not unconstitutionally impair the law firm's vested contractual rights because those rights could be satisfied from the property of the former community or the separate property of the husband.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business was assessed by the department as owing sales tax, penalties, and interest. The business filed a protest. The Board of Tax Appeals found no taxes were owed but ordered the business to file sales tax returns even though its sales were exempt from tax. The business again failed to file a return and received a notice of assessment. The business filed an action for injunction against the department enjoining the department from seizing its property or assessing tax, penalties, or interest. The trial court issued the injunction and the department appealed. The court noted that the action was filed more than 30 days after the judgment of the Board; the trial court had no jurisdiction to review that decision. The court further noted that the procedure for challenging the payment of a tax was to pay the amount due and then to sue for its return. The court held than because the business did not appeal the Board's decision ordering it to file a sales tax return and did not pay the tax before bringing an action challenging the assessment, the trial court was without jurisdiction over the action.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the illegitimate daughter had a cause of action against the legitimate heirs to have herself declared an irregular heir by producing evidence of acknowledgment of the relationship. The court stated that until that relationship was established, the illegitimate daughter had no ownership interest in the property belonging to the succession of her alleged father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several years after the expropriation, the interdict discovered that the land had not been incorporated in the highway project for which it was taken. He asked that the property be reconveyed to him and a right-of-way attorney for the State advised him that the resale had been approved. On appeal, the court noted that no issues of fact were in dispute. The court held that the State acted illegally by expropriating more land than was needed for highway purposes. The court held that it was the State's duty to act within the legal limits of its authority in expropriation matters, and, because it failed to do so, the interdict had the right to reclaim what had been taken from him illegally and not used for public purposes without regard for the 10-day period mentioned in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:447. The court held that, contrary to the State's argument, it had the authority to pass upon the necessity of the expropriation. Finally, the court noted that the fact of the State's agreement to reconvey the property at the expropriation price was documented by the curator's exhibits. The court held that the agreement was not unenforceable as in violation of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48:221.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment by the district court ordering the State to reconvey the land for the same price.</SPAN></P>

The husband subsequently filed for divorce in another county on the grounds of living separate and apart for more than one year. The wife asserted that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide the issue because venue was already established in the county where the separation complaint was filed. The wife further asserted that the two-year period applied to the divorce. The appellate court held that the jurisdiction issue turned on where the husband was domiciled. The evidence showed that the husband lived and worked in the county where the divorce complaint was filed since the separation. The court held that the husband met his burden of showing that the husband's domicile had changed prior to filing the divorce complaint. Next, the court held that the one-year period contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:301 applied to the divorce action. The court held that the separation period was completed after the amendment to &sect; 9:301 became effective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners owned several lots in a subdivision. A dispute arose between the parties concerning a building restriction that was applicable to the subject lots.

Plaintiffs contended that such a restriction was unconstitutional because it discriminated against individuals with low income and denied such persons equal protection of the laws. Defendants contended that the only purpose for the restriction was to form a neighborhood that did not look like a &quot;government program.&quot; The court held that the restriction was subject to scrutiny under the equal protection provisions of either the federal or state constitution because the clerk of court's action in recording the restrictive covenant in dispute constituted a &quot;state action.&quot; The court held that the building restriction, if enforced, would result in invidious discrimination against an identifiable class, specifically persons of low income, and, thus, violated the federal and state guarantees of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marshals appealed the trial court's decision re-urging the same contentions. The court read the entire record and found that the trial court in its written reasons for judgment correctly disposed of the factual and legal issues presented. The marshals urged the court to adopt the highest level of review, which would demand a compelling interest on the part of defendant state in excluding the marshals from the Police Retirement System. The court did not agree that this was the appropriate level of review. The exclusion of the marshals was not a distinction based on race or alienage nor did it affect a fundamental right. Neither was the distinction based on gender or birth status which would trigger an intermediate level of review. The appropriate level of review was &quot;minimum rationality,&quot; and the function of the trial court was to determine whether the distinction was arbitrary or whether it was based on some rational and reasonable ground relative to the interest sought to be furthered. The state distinguished the needs of the two relative to the functions of the marshals' and the police's employment. The court did not find the distinction arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wife appealed a judgment on a rule nisi from the Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jackson, Louisiana, which denied her request for alimony pendente lite. Plaintiff husband had brought suit for a separation from bed and board. By her reconventional demand, the wife likewise prayed for a judgment of separation. The sole issue was whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the temporary alimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was based on the fact that the husband had no means to pay and the fact that the wife's needs were being cared for by her parents. The immaturity of the parties and the fact that they had both returned to the homes of their respective parents to further their education were additional considerations. The wife contended that the husband could not quit his employment in order to avoid his obligation of maintaining her in a standard comparable to that which she had enjoyed before the separation. The court found, however, that the record failed to support an allegation that he quit his job. His uncontradicted testimony was that he was discharged. The court agreed with the trial court that, although the wife had no income, an award of alimony pendente lite was inappropriate in a situation in which the parties, both teenagers, were unemployed students living with their parents. The parties lived together as husband and wife for only five months during which time they continued to receive support from their parents. Under such circumstances, the court concluded that the district court's denial of the wife's request for alimony pendente lite was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual sued the company to recover damages for personal injuries that he sustained when part of a diesel engine fell on his foot. The district court held the company was the individual's statutory employer and therefore, was immune from tort liability. The court noted that La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23:1061 provided that a principal was liable for workmen's compensation benefits to the employees of an independent contractor who were injured on the job if that contractor was performing work which was a part of the principal's trade, business or occupation. The undisputed facts demonstrated that the individual undertook to repair an engine on the company's oil rig, which was an activity essential to the company's business. The company was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it was the individual's statutory employer. Contrary to the individual's contention, the court stated &sect; 23:1061 had repeatedly withstood constitutional attack. The district court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A parish police jury tabled and later granted the owners' petition for a zoning reclassification of their property from single family residential to neighborhood family residential.

The court held that under the plain and unequivocal language of &sect; X11, the police jury, through the planning commission, was required to keep track of the date of filing. The court found that the police jury failed to comply with those procedures based on testimony of its administrative assistant that he did not write the date of entry on petitions that entered the zoning board, as well as testimony of an expert that the 90-day period in which the jury could take action ran from the date that the planning commission certified the petition as correct in form, and that of the jury's administrator that there was no procedure for certifying a petition and that the 90 days began to run from a different date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All three of the property owner's attempts to have his property rezoned from a residential to some type of commercial classification failed. Thereafter, the property owner brought an action challenging the validity of appellants' zoning ordinance and the trial court found in his favor. The court reversed. The record contained substantial evidence to support an objective determination that the property should remain residential rather than be rezoned under a commercial classification because rezoning would have been incompatible with and have an adverse effect on the surrounding areas, as the vast majority of the surrounding area was zoned residential and there would have been increased traffic congestion. Furthermore, appellants did not act arbitrarily in refusing to reclassify the property owner's land because appellants' zoning decision was consistent with its prior land use policies. Finally, the property owner failed to demonstrate that the subject property had no practical use under the present residential classification, as the property owner's own witnesses established the land's value and utility under that classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed a personal injury suit against the tort-feasor and the insurer as a result of a car accident. He filed a supplemental petition, adding his insurer under the uninsured motorist provisions. His insurer filed an exception of prescription to the claimant's uninsured motorist claim. The trial court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5629 limited the period within which the claimant could bring an uninsured motorist claim to 10 months and 27 days. As the claim fell outside that time period, the trial court sustained his insurer's exception and dismissed the claim. The claimant appealed, asking the court to consider whether this statute of limitation applied retroactively. The court held that the time period allowed by the legislature within which persons affected by the enactment of &sect; 9:5629 could assert their otherwise divested contractual cause of action was adequate and reasonable and not in violation of the due process guarantees of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action ruling that it was not shown that the doctor breached the recognized standard of care. The court affirmed holding that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2794 a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action was required to show that the duty of reasonable care and diligence was breached and caused injury to the plaintiff. The statute was constitutional because it did not hamper a plaintiff's search for justice.</SPAN></P>

An off-duty police trainee arrived at the scene and began to direct traffic. The insured walked about 70 feet from the vehicle to engage the officer trainee in conversation. The officer warned the insured of the danger of standing there and immediately thereafter a van struck and seriously injured the insured. At trial, the insured recovered for both accidents from his own insurance company and he sought to recover from the insurer of the car in which he was a passenger. He received an award for the first accident, but the trial court denied any recovery for the second accident. He appealed. The court found that the insured was not covered by the insurer at the time of the second accident under the uninsured motorist provision because he was not occupying the insured vehicle. The court interpreted &quot;occupying&quot; broadly and concluded that the insured had no physical contact with the car and had no physical relationship with the car, such as putting his hand in the window. The court affirmed the holding that the insurer did not have to pay the insured for the second accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the former version of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:427, public schools were required to pay teachers of exceptional children their base salary plus ten percent. The statute was thereafter amended, making such supplemental pay permissive rather than mandatory but precluding schools from reducing the pay of any teacher already receiving the supplement. The school board filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not required to continue to pay the supplemental salary to those who had received it when it was mandatory. The trial court entered judgment requiring the school board to continue to pay the teachers the supplement, and the school board appealed, claiming that the amended act was unconstitutional under La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 12(A)(8), which precluded the legislature from passing a law that regulated the management of the public schools. In affirming, the court concluded that the act was presumed to be constitutional, and the school board failed to meet its burden of establishing that the classification created thereby was not reasonable and proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank sought to recover balances due on unsecured promissory notes signed by the husband. The husband left the state and the bank sought a writ attachment. The wife intervened to dissolve the writ on the ground that the husband could not alienate or encumber the family home without her consent. The district court found in favor of the bank and upheld the writ. The primary question was whether the wife could defeat a writ of attachment against the family home on the ground that the community debt, from which the writ arose, was incurred by the husband alone. Contrary to the wife's contentions, the court stated the protections of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2801 only became operative when the husband designated the property as a family home, which was not done in this case. The court held that the husband's execution of unsecured promissory notes which constituted community obligations was not the equivalent of a sale, mortgage, alienation or encumbrance of the family home which required the wife's consent before a writ of attachment could validly issue. The court did not reach the question of constitutionality of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2334 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2801.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was an employee of the board. For the three years prior to her taking a sabbatical leave, her duties were to teach reading at an elementary school. When she returned from her leave, she was assigned to teach language at the same school. She sought to oblige the board to assign her to teach reading, and challenged the trial court's refusal of mandamus. The court agreed with the trial court. The issue was the meaning of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1182's provision for return &quot;to the same position.&quot; The teacher's argument was that her pre-leave position was that of &quot;reading teacher&quot; and that &sect; 17:1182 obliged the board to return her to the duties of teaching reading. The court interpreted position to mean that of teacher. Because the basic teacher tenure law did not give a teacher tenure as a teacher of a specific subject, an express provision that a teacher returning from sabbatical had the right to teach the same subject would constitute a benefit beyond the basic tenure law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient had alleged that she suffered injury as a result of negligent medical treatment by the physician.

In affirming, the court held that although subject matter jurisdiction and venue were property, the physician's exception was actually an exception of prematurity. Because the action was clearly premature, the action had been properly dismissed. The court held that the case was premature because no medical review panel had been established or rendered an opinion as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47. The court, however, held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47(C) does not require that physician panel members be selected from the same community or locality as the physician.</SPAN></P>

The court held that requiring accumulation of offenses would defeat the underlying purpose of the statute, therefore, the court rejected defendant's argument. Additionally, the court held that La.

In affirming, the court concluded that workmen's compensation benefits were the employee's exclusive remedy under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032. While the employee claimed an exception to the exclusivity rule by asserting that the conduct at issue was &quot;intentional,&quot; no evidence was presented to establish that any of the defendants intended that the employee would sustain any serious injury during his work as a general manual laborer. The court likewise rejected the employee's contention that the defendants violated the child labor law, La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Challenging the constitutionality of La. Rev. Civ. Code art. 919 (revised), defendant purported son filed a suspensive appeal from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which entered a judgment that he was not entitled to succeed in the deceased's estate. Answering the appeal, defendant legitimate heir challenged the finding that the purported was the deceased's acknowledged illegitimate son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purported son filed a petition claiming to be an illegitimate child of the deceased and seeking to succeed in the deceased's estate. The legitimate heir opposed the petition, and the trial court found that the purported son was the acknowledged illegitimate child of the deceased but denied him relief under La. Civ.

The purported son appealed, and the court reversed the judgment, remanding the cause with instructions to strike the judgments purporting to recognize the legitimate heir as the sole heir and sending her into possession of the entire estate. The court first held that the finding that the purported son was supported on the record and substantially unrebutted. Turning to the purported son's basis for appeal, the court noted that art. 919 had recently been held by the highest state appellate court to be unconstitutional, violating the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. of 1974 art. I, &sect; 3. Because the trial court's judgment was based solely on La. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents of a minor child who was killed when he was backed over by a car brought a wrongful death lawsuit against the driver of the car, his parents, and his insurer. The trial court held that the mother was contributorily negligent in the death of her son and that the father could not recover because the mother's negligence was imputed to the father. On appeal, the father argued that La. Civ. Code Ann art. 2344 provided that damages resulting from personal injury of both the husband and the wife were their separate property. The court noted that article 2344 did not go into effect until after the accident at issue and held that it was prospective in effect only. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's determination that the father was barred from recovering for the wrongful death of his son. However, the court held that the father was entitled to medical payments and funeral expenses under the terms of the insurance policy, reversed the trial court's denial of those claims, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor was adjudicated a delinquent child by the juvenile court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department of correction employee was a passenger in an automobile driven by the military department employee. The automobile was struck by another automobile when the military department employee ran a red light while transporting a department of correction inmate to the hospital. The court reversed the judgment and ordered that the department of correction employee's suit against appellants be dismissed. The court held that the trial court erred when it concluded that the tort action was not barred by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032, a part of the workmen's compensation law. Although the two employees were employed by two different departments of the State at the time of the accident, the court held that they were both actually employees of the State for purposes of workmen's compensation. Further, the tort suit could not be maintained under the &quot;intentional act&quot; exception to immunity provided in &sect; 23:1032 because the record did not establish the type of intentional act required under &sect; 23:1032. Finally, the court concluded that the military department employee was acting within the normal course and scope of his employment for purposes of tort immunity under &sect; 23:1032.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother took her child to the hospital with a fractured femur and skull fracture.

On the state's neglect petition, the juvenile court adjudicated the child as one in need of care and placed her in the state's custody, while she informally remained under her grandmother's care. The mother appealed. The court reversed and remanded because the juvenile court did not appoint counsel for the child as clearly mandated by La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. art. 95. The court found no merit in the contention that appointment was unnecessary because the district attorney represented the child's interest.</SPAN></P>

Reciprocal citations for contempt followed where each party accused the other of violating the preliminary injunction. Prior to the return dates the union moved to transfer the contempt proceedings to the criminal docket for trial by jury under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 23:848(3). The trial court allowed the removal of the proceedings to the criminal court. The court held the writ peremptory and reversed, finding that the trial court had erred in its determination. The power of the court to punish for contempt was stated in La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 2 (1974), which limits the power to punish by law. The 1974 change to the constitution did not evoke a change from that of 1921 according to the court it just condensed it.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that because the driver had been issued a restricted license on a prior occasion, La. Rev. Stat.

In addition, the driver did not call his employer as a witness to testify that the driver needed a car for his job as a car salesman or that the driver would be terminated if he did not have a car. Thus, the driver did not prove that the suspension of his license would prevent him from earning a living or deprive him or his family of the necessities of life.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a non-profit organization of Louisiana wholesale tobacco dealers and other wholesale tobacco dealers, filed a complaint against defendants, the state revenue department and border state tobacco dealers, who permitted wholesale tobacco dealers in Texas to purchase and use cigarette tax stamps and metered machines or devices, at a discount, outside the territorial limits of Louisiana. Plaintiffs contended these actions were ultra vires, unlawful and unconstitutional. Defendants and intervenor, a distribution center, urged that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring suit, contending that plaintiffs really sought to thwart the intervenor, a competitor, rather than against the state revenue department. The district court held for defendants stating that a reciprocal agreement existed between Louisiana and Texas which did have to be a written, only an agreement. Plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed and holding that the legislature authorized the head of the state revenue department to grant out-of-state tobacco dealers in border states the discount granted to in-state dealers if the other state accorded to Louisiana dealers operating in those states a similar privilege.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2772 had retrospective application and precluded their suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fifteen years after the property owners assumed occupation of their newly-constructed residence, they noticed that the house was sinking in the rear and brought suit against the general contractor. The general contractor filed an exception of no cause for action under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2772; the district court maintained the exception and dismissed the property owner's claim. The property owners appealed, claiming that the statute could not prohibit their claim where it was not in existence at the time they entered into the contract. In affirming, the court concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2772 precluded the filing of a suit for the faulty design and construction of a residence more than 10 years after the property owners assumed occupation of the dwelling. Under subsection (G) thereof, causes of action that existed prior to the statute's effective date would not be preempted until one year from the effective date or until the applicable statutory period, whichever was later. Therefore, the property owners had a reasonable time under the terms of &sect; 9:2772 to assert their rights, and retroactive application of the statute did not violate their due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the natural daughter of a married, otherwise childless decedent, appealed the judgment from the Seventh Judicial Court, Parish of Catahoula, State of Louisiana, which denied her claim that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919 was unconstitutional and that she was thus the decedent's sole heir, and which rejected her claim to have defendant administrator removed as unqualified under La. Code Civ. Proc. art. 3097.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The brother of a married decedent with no legitimate children was appointed as administrator of the decedent's succession. The decedent's natural daughter filed a petition to have the administrator removed and also filed an opposition to the sale of succession immovables. The trial court dismissed the daughter's demands. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that because the decedent was married to a woman other than the daughter's mother at the time the daughter was conceived, and because the decedent remained married to the other woman until his death, the daughter could not be duly acknowledged under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 204. Thus, the daughter had no right of inheritance under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919 and her only claim against the estate was for alimony under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 920. Because La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919 applied only to duly acknowledged children, and because the daughter was not duly acknowledged, the court did not reach the issue of its constitutionality. Therefore, the administrator was properly qualified under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3097 and the judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment which denied the claim of the natural daughter of a married, otherwise childless decedent that a statute affecting the inheritance rights of nonmarital children was unconstitutional and that the daughter was the decedent's sole heir, and which dismissed her claim to have the administrator of the decedent's succession removed as unqualified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife contended that she contracted Type B Serum hepatitis from the blood administered to her after a hysterectomy. The district court did not find that there was any implied warranty in connection with the sale of blood and further believed that no evidence was adduced that convinced it there was negligence in the preparation of the blood, the infusion of the blood or the storage of the blood. The blood the wife received was traced to a donor who later tested positive for Type B Serum hepatitis. The wife's sister also had the same type of hepatitis contracted at the hospital one year earlier. The court found that it was apparent that the wife failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the blood she received was unwholesome at the time of the transfusion and that it was the source of her injury. The court did not necessarily agree with the written reasons of judgment rendered by the district court, they found that the judgment was not manifestly erroneous in its results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The slot machine was an operable, one-cent antique slot machine, but it was not used for gambling purposes and no criminal charges were brought against the owner. The owner alleged that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:31 was a denial of due process and of the right to property guaranteed by La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2, 4 because it subjected the machine to seizure and destruction without any judicial intervention and without notice or opportunity for a hearing. Upon review, the court noted that owning a slot machine itself was not a crime. The court also noted that a state, through the exercise of its police power, could constitutionally act to summarily confiscate and destroy things which could not be put to a lawful use. However, the court reasoned, if the thing seized was susceptible of a legal use, due process required notice and opportunity for a hearing. Therefore, the court concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:31 was unconstitutional as violative of La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2,4 as related to the confiscation and immediate destruction, without judicial proceedings, of those items included within the definitional term &quot;gambling device.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found no manifest error in the trial court's finding that there was no proof of adultery. The court also determined that the ex-wife's improperly captioned pleading did not prejudice the ex-husband because it was clear from the manner in which the trial on the merits was conducted that there was no surprise. The court also determined that the ex-wife's failure to use the adjective &quot;permanent&quot; before the noun &quot;alimony&quot; in the prayer was not prejudicial because it was apparent that if the ex-wife was entitled to alimony, it was permanent alimony to which she was entitled, not alimony pendente lite. Thus, the court concluded that the ex-husband's claims regarding the insufficiency of the pleadings were without merit.

The court held that the writ of mandamus was not proper because discretion and the evaluation of evidence was required in order to resolve the definition of &quot;emoluments.&quot; The court found that retirement benefits were &quot;emoluments&quot; but determined that the employee was not entitled to a credit for unused leave, pursuant to La.

She filed a rule for judgment for past due alimony when he was 15 months in arrears. The trial court granted judgment for 10 months, but terminated the accrual of alimony pendente lite prior to the effective date of the decision in Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 99 S. Ct. 1102 (1979). Appellant filed an appeal, and the court, assuming that the alimony statute was unconstitutional under Orr, considered whether alimony pendente lite awarded and accrued prior to the Orr decision was uncollectible. The court determined that the decision should not be applied retroactively because substantial inequity would result if prior judgments awarding alimony were declared invalid. Therefore, alimony which accrued prior to the Orr decision was not affected. Since the judgment for alimony arrearages was proper, the award of attorney fees to the appellee as the prevailing party was also proper.</SPAN></P>

The court did not find the husband's valuation of dealership stock to be a breach of his fiduciary duty. The court found that there was no record regarding the true value of the stock and that the claimant had a clear understanding of the structure of closely held corporations. Nor did the court find that the absence of her dower rights in a balance sheet used in negotiating the settlement was problematic; the final agreement contained language describing her rights. The court found no breach of duty on the husband's part in failing to inform his wife of the community interest in the appreciation of his separately owned stock where there was no evidence that he was even aware that any such interest existed. The court found that the husband did owe his wife for past due alimony payments. A decision rendering Louisiana's alimony laws was not retroactive and had no effect.</SPAN></P>

The employee challenged the constitutionality of the Workers' Compensation Law's exclusive remedy provision, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032 as amended by Act 147 of 1976, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought an action in tort against his co-employee for personal injuries he sustained while collecting garbage. He contended that the co-employee's continued operation of the garbage truck, which he acknowledged was unsafe and hazardous, and his failures to observe the rules of the road and to warn constituted intentional acts. The court ruled that the employee's constitutional challenge to the amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032 was not barred, although he did not raise it in his complaint, because the issue arose when the insurer sought to dismiss the action. In reversing the trial court's dismissal of the employee's suit, the court found that, although the amendment to &sect; 23:1032 restricted the avenues of relief that were available to injured workers, the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Law did not extend to intentional torts. The court held that: (1) malice was not an element of intent under &sect; 23:1032; (2) the application of &sect; 23:1032 did not deprive the employee of equal protection under La. Const. art.

On appeal, the pension fund argued that the trial court erred in finding no justiciable issue. In affirming, the court ruled that, although the provisions for declaratory judgment suits, La.

The court ruled that the courts were without power to render advisory opinions on abstract questions.

He argued that he was misled by settlement discussions, he was not subject to tax under &sect; 3:455, and the judgment was entered on insufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The producer argued that plaintiff Louisiana Department of Agriculture led him to believe that the suit would be settled.

The court found no evidence in the trial records to support his contention of misleading conduct or ill practice by the department's attorneys. The court could not speculate on facts asserted in brief which were not properly a matter of record and were not properly before the court. The court held that the producer's argument as to the applicability of &sect; 3:455 to a producer shipping his own sweet potatoes was a constitutional challenge, which the producer failed to raise and/or produce evidence in support of in the trial court. The court could not legally consider the issue. The court declined to exercise its remand power under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2164, because there was no provision in the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 prohibiting the application of &sect; 3:455 to shippers and processors without regard to their status as producers or growers.

In affirming in part, the court ruled that it would not determine a constitutional issue unless essential to a decision of the case. The court held that La. Code Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the acknowledged illegitimate children of the decedent, appealed from the judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), rejecting their demands in the decedent's succession. They had filed their suit seeking a rescission of the judgment of possession, which recognized defendant, the decedent's adopted daughter, as his sole heir. At issue was whether La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had died leaving no children born of his two marriages. He had, however, adopted one of his formerly illegitimate children. It was that child who was found by the district court to have been the decedent's sole heir. The court reversed and annulled the district court judgment. The court held that La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 prohibited the total denial of inheritance rights of the acknowledged illegitimate children in the succession of their natural father. The court opined that, although La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919 was designed to serve the important state purpose of protecting land titles, the unlimited discrimination presented in art. 919 was unreasonable and arbitrary and thus contrary to the provisions of the Louisiana Constitution. It was noted that the illegitimate children were excluded from their father's succession without ever having any procedural opportunity to place themselves in his intestate succession despite the fact that they were acknowledged. Therefore, the court concluded that art. 919 disinherited too broadly and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause and La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dissenters appealed from an order of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which granted the summary judgment motion of defendants, officers of a teacher's union formed in a consolidation opposed by the dissenters, and dismissed the dissenters' action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to block the consolidation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher's union was formed by the consolidation of two separate unions, one predominantly white and the other predominantly black, resulting from a two-thirds majority vote of both unions. The Secretary of State issued a certificate declaring the consolidation and a certificate of incorporation, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12:205B. The dissenters alleged non-compliance with statutory prerequisites for consolidation, and asserted that the minority guarantees were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed summary judgment for the union. The court held that under &sect; 12:205B the certificate of incorporation of the union was conclusive, and could be challenged only in a direct attack by the State. The court held that the guarantees did not amount to racially restrictive covenants. The court noted that the guarantees were temporary, and intended not to exclude any minority group, but to remedy past discrimination and allow full participation by black members. The court thus held that the guarantees did not violate the Louisiana or United States Constitutions or 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1941.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court order which granted summary judgment to the consolidated union's officers and dismissed the dissenters' action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to block the consolidation.</SPAN></P>
