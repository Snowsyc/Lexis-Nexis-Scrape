</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised two questions: (1) whether the second count was a violation of the double jeopardy clause of the state and federal constitutions, and (2) whether the second count was a violation of Ariz.

On appeal, the court held that the question of whether two offenses were the same, and the criteria for resolving that question, were that the two offenses must not contain a common element. The court held that the two offenses with which defendant was charged had no common element. Accordingly, the court held that it was, therefore, perfectly clear that double jeopardy was not a viable defense in the case. The court also held that the legislature intended to engraft Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1580 onto Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1641 as an exception so that the two statutes should be read to mean that for one act there may be only one prosecution except when it was committed while the accused was out of jail on his own recognizance. Accordingly, the court held that the second count was not a violation of &sect; 13-1641.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

There was no question that the use of the stadium at the particular time did not interfere with the instruction, teaching, and training conducted at the state university. There was no question concerning the power of the board to lease the stadium. The court did not believe that leasing the stadium for an occasional religious service at a fair rental value was an appropriation or application of public property for religious purposes. The lease did not place the power, prestige, or influence of the state behind the religious speaker's beliefs or practices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of inflicting injuries that were the proximate cause of the victim's death. Defendant waived his right to a jury trial on the prosecutor's promise not to seek the death penalty. On appeal, defendant argued that his waiver of a jury trial was not voluntarily and intelligently made because the death penalty later was held to be unconstitutional, his ex-wife was not competent to testify, the trial court erred in admitting defendant's inculpatory statement into evidence, the evidence did not support a conviction for second degree murder, and that the sentence was excessive. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) waiver of a jury trial was intelligently and voluntarily made based upon the law as it existed at the time of the waiver; (2) defendant, although he was hospitalized, had notice of the pending divorce action and was represented by counsel; therefore, lack of due process did not preclude the ex-wife from testifying. (3) evidence showed that the confession was voluntary and that the beating contributed to the victim's death; (4) evidence supported the finding of malice for second degree murder; and (5) the sentence was within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of a trial court (Arizona), which had convicted him for the sale of heroin. Defendant had filed a motion to dismiss for failure to bring him to trial within the 60-day limit, which motion was denied. Trial commenced on that same day. Defendant was sentenced to not less than 10 nor more than 12 years in the Arizona State Prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that it was error for the trial judge to deny his motion to dismiss for failure to bring him to trial within the 60 day time limit specified in Ariz. R. Crim. P. 236 (1956). Although defendant never waived the 60 day period, the court held that he was brought to trial as soon as reasonably possible. The court held that the action of the trial judge in continuing the case was well within his discretion as a necessary adjunct to an orderly disposition of the court's business. As a second issue, defendant urged that his motion to quash the indictment should have been granted because the examination of the grand jurors as to their qualifications was not done properly. The state had argued that the empanelling judge had a right to rely on the fact that the grand jurors were drawn from a list of electors and that a questioning on electors' qualifications was not necessary. The court disagreed with the State, in light of the wording of Ariz. R. Crim. P. 82. However, the court found that there was substantial compliance with the Rule and therefore defendant was required to show prejudice by reason of any alleged deficiencies in the proceedings. Defendant did not do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publisher distributed a free off-campus newspaper to college students. The university enacted a regulation which required the publisher to apply to distribute its newspaper on campus, limited the distribution locations, and required the payment of a fee. The university contended that the regulation prevented the disruption of educational activities and covered litter clean-up expenses. The court ruled that the regulation was unconstitutional. The court determined that the regulation of expressive activity was reasonable if the expression would unduly interfere with the normal use of public property by other members of the public. Because the university's regulation was not designed to prevent the disruption of ordinary educational activities and arbitrarily limited the distribution locations, the court concluded that the regulation went overboard and was unreasonable by going beyond what was required to regulate the time, place, and manner of the exercise of First Amendment rights. In addition, the court found that the fee was an unconstitutional licensing fee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents filed a petition for the incorporation of their community into a town. After a hearing, the petition was denied. Thereafter, the residents filed a writ of mandamus to compel the Board to order the approval of the incorporation petition. The trial judge directed the Board to incorporate, however, before the order was final, a city council annexed property that was contiguous to the area in question. The proposed town site was then allegedly too close to the nearest city and, as such, could not be incorporated. The appellate court determined that the city's annexation rendered the issue moot. On appeal, the court found that the preceding court erred in reversing the judgment of the trial court on the grounds of mootness. The court stated that the city council could not oust the jurisdiction of the trial court by way of the annexation because the trial court already had jurisdiction to order the incorporation of the town. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the proposed town site established all the requirements of a community under Ariz. Rev.

The state and the real party in interest then waived trial by jury. Counsel for the real party in interest filed a motion to have immunity from prosecution granted to a defense witness whose testimony was to exculpate the real party in interest but implicated the witness in criminal activity. The judge granted immunity to the defense witness. The state brought a special action to determine whether &sect; 13-1804, the immunity statute, extended to requests by the defense for immunity from prosecution for a witness called to testify upon behalf of the defense. The court set aside the order of the judge. It was clear that &sect; 13-1804 was to aid the prosecution. Faced with a claim of the privilege against self-incrimination, there was nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment which gave a criminal defendant the right to have immunity granted to the witness. There was no reciprocal right of immunity. The compelling state interest in the effective enforcement of the criminal law was sufficient justification for the legislature to limit the grant of immunity to the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Arizona), which found him guilty of four counts of child molesting (Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-653) and three counts of lewd and lascivious acts (Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-652).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant induced the victims, ages nine, 10 and 11, into joining a so-called sex club. Although neither force nor threats were used, the children participated in various unnatural acts with each other and with defendant. The trial court sentenced defendant to terms of not less than 75 years nor more than life on each of the seven counts to run concurrently. On appeal, the court affirmed but remanded for resentencing. The court found that defendant would be entitled to the statutory deductions (for good behavior and double time) from his minimum sentence and eligible for parole prior to the expiration of the 75-year minimum. It appeared from the transcript that the trial judge was under the impression that defendant would be eligible for parole in one-third of the minimum sentence. This was incorrect. For this reason, the case was to be returned to the trial court so that the trial judge could reassess his sentence in light of his announced intention. The victims' testimony did not need to be corroborated because there was direct evidence connecting defendant with the crimes and the victims could not have been accomplices to the crime of molestation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review after he was convicted in the Superior Court of Maricopa County (Arizona) of the felony offense of Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) While License Suspended, Revoked or Refused, in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-692.02. Two questions were certified to the court: (1) could the Motor Vehicle Department (MVD) could base a suspension on uncounseled guilty pleas to DWI, and (2) was &sect; 28-692.02 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MVD suspended defendant's driver's license for multiple DWI convictions. In every case he had pled guilty. He claimed that no one ever told him that he had a right to counsel and that he could not afford counsel in those cases. He was arrested again for DWI and charged under the recently enacted &sect; 28-692.02, which made the offense a felony if committed while defendant's license was suspended. The court held that while defendant could not be jailed for uncounseled guilty pleas, unless he knowingly and intelligently waived counsel, nothing prevented the DMV from imposing civil penalties based upon those convictions. The court held that the statute did not create an unreasonable or arbitrary classification. The statute was intended to deter serial DWI convictions and the State had a valid interest in attempting to bar habitual drunk drivers from its roads. The class of drivers subjected to felony prosecution by the statute was rationally defined as those whose driving records merited such treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the first certified question in the affirmative; the MVD could base a license suspension upon a driver's uncounseled guilty pleas to DWI charges. It answered the second question in the negative; the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The election statute declared unconstitutional by the judge, Ariz. Rev.

The candidate contended that this instruction was misleading because it suggested that voters were required to vote for more than one candidate in an election for multiple offices and that such instructions would undermine his strategy of having his supporters vote only for him. The court granted the city's petition and held that &sect; 16-844(I) was not unconstitutional. The court held that voters were expected to exercise reasonable judgment in casting their votes and that nothing in the ballot instructions required under &sect; 16-844(I) would have been misleading to the average voter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction resulted from his sale of LSD to an undercover police officer and from making arrangements to sell marijuana. Defendant left Arizona and was extradited from another state over a year later. Upon the discharge of defendant's public defender under Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 24, the trial court ordered the public defender to assist defendant with his defense. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's claim that the marijuana statute, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1002.07 (amended 1961), was unconstitutional based on the classification of marijuana with narcotic drugs; the Arizona Legislature had a rational basis for the classification. Defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated because he left the jurisdiction, fought extradition, and the State proceeded with diligence in his prosecution. Defendant was not entitled to unlimited resources, such as access to a law library, once he chose to represent himself, and he accepted the risk that self-representation would be less than effective. Defendant's rejected jury instructions were incorrect statements of law, and he did not present evidence that entitled him to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1621.01(I). In a bench trial, the patient was found not guilty by reason of insanity on charges for burglary, aggravated battery, and rape, and was committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the criminal proceedings that resulted in the patient's commitment, the trial court ordered the patient committed to the State hospital until such time as he could meet the conditions of release. When the patient commenced proceedings for his release, two psychiatrists certified that he was no longer a danger to himself or to others and a jury found that he was no longer a danger to himself or to others. The State was successful on its motion for a new trial, and in the second trial, the jury found that the patient failed to meet his burden of proof that he was fit for release. The patient alleged that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1621.01 was unconstitutional as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court. The court held that &sect; 13-1621.01 was unconstitutional and that the patient was entitled to have his petition for release from commitment considered on the same basis as patients who were committed in civil proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor filed a motion to quash the information that charged it with the crime of air pollution, a misdemeanor.

XIV and Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 4, 13?

The government respondents contended that the ordinances were permissible regulation of commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

Basically they prohibited &quot;topless&quot; and nude performances. The entertainers and waitresses were charged in city court with violations of the ordinances and brought this special action in the court of appeals. The court of appeals held that the ordinances violated the petitioners' freedom of speech. The court held the ordinances but statutory applications of the common law offense of indecent exposure. The government had a sufficient interest in regulating the &quot;nonspeech&quot; element of the conduct involved. The court held that the establishments presenting topless and nude performances did so primarily to attract customers. The government could regulate the commercial speech involved. It held that the ordinances were not aimed at serious works which lift the spirit, improve the mind, enrich the human personality, and develop character.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police detective testified that he purchased from defendant four &quot;papers&quot; of heroin on two dates. A chemist for a crime laboratory testified that all four papers contained useable amounts of heroin. As an alibi defense, defendant called four witnesses who testified he was out of town on the date of the second transaction. On appeal, the court held that the evidence supported the trial court's finding, so it was not disturbed. The court rejected defendant's contention that the requirement that all jurors had to read and write English violated his right to a jury of his peers. The ability to read and write the English language had a vital relation to the performance of the duties of a juror, which applied to all candidates for jury service, irrespective of race, color, or creed. The provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21-201, requiring each juror to be an elector, and of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-101(A)(4) (1970), requiring electors to read and write the English language, denied no rights secured by the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought intervention in an action filed by the city and two of its taxpayers seeking to have the act creating a retirement system for public safety personnel declared unconstitutional. Petitioners desired to have the act upheld. All parties to the original action objected to the intervention of petitioners, and the trial court denied intervention. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court denying intervention and the court directed the trial court to allow petitioners to intervene as parties in the action. The court held that pursuant to Ariz. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2), petitioners had an interest in the action because petitioners, as beneficiaries under the act, would have no chance in future proceedings to have its constitutionality upheld. The principles of stare decisis would have effectively disposed of their interest without any opportunity for them to be heard. This practical disadvantage to the protection of their interest in the retirement fund warranted their intervention as of right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from judgments of the Superior Court of Yuma County (Arizona), which convicted defendants for murder in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-451, 452, 453, and assault with a deadly weapon in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-249(A). They also appealed their sentences of 45 to 75 years for murder with a concurrent sentence as to each defendant of five to 10 years on the charges of assault with a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with the murder of one victim and assault with a deadly weapon upon another. The trial court individually and extensively questioned all three defendants as to their understanding of the charges against them, their guilty pleas, the consequences of those pleas, and their potential sentences. The trial court also advised defendants of their various constitutional rights. At the time of sentencing the trial judge carefully repeated many of the questions and statements he had previously asked and given. On appeal, the court affirmed defendants' convictions and sentences. It held that the trial court took the utmost precautions to insure that defendants' guilty pleas were intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily entered. Although one defendant, because of his young age, contended that the sentence was excessive as to him, the court held that the sentences imposed upon him were within the statutory limitations and that there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court. There were no errors as to defendants' plea bargains as the trial court was particularly careful in determining that there was a fact basis for the pleas.</SPAN></P>

The home builders association filed suit seeking a declaration that the tax imposed was void and an order directing that the taxes paid be refunded. The trial court found the tax to be lawful and entered judgment in favor of the city. The court accepted jurisdiction under a special writ because other municipalities were interested in enacting a similar tax. The court vacated the trial court's order holding that the power to tax existed in municipal corporations only to the extent to which it was clearly conferred by the charter or state statutes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The IDA authorized, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. tit. IX, ch. 11, the issuance of certain revenue bonds to finance the construction of pollution control facility. After the attorney general refused to sanction the bond issue in a written opinion, the IDA instituted a proceeding before the court to obtain an order that directed the attorney general to issue an opinion that the relevant bond issues were in conformity with Ariz. Rev. Stat. tit. IX, ch. 11. In evaluating the IDA's request for mandamus, the court found that the protection of the health of the citizens of the state was the obvious public purpose sought to be accomplished by Ariz. Rev. Stat. tit. IX, ch. 11. Further, such a purpose was as important as industrial development, and the method chosen by the legislature to accomplish the purpose was essentially the same as that approved by the vast majority of courts of other states for funding of industrial development. Thus, the court concluded that the relevant bond issues did not violate Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7, or any other of the constitutional provisions raised by the attorney general. The attorney general was directed therefore to issue the requested opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the trial court properly admitted evidence under the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine and &quot;incident to arrest&quot; exception to the Fourth Amendment; (2) the evidence against defendant was sufficient to support the jury's conviction; and (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the admission of exclusion of evidence, which was largely within its purview.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed one victim at gun point. During his escape, he shot and killed another victim. Defendant pled not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant's trial was bifurcated for determination of guilt and of insanity under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1621.01. Reversing in part, the court concluded that defendant should not have been convicted of both robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. An accused was protected against double punishment for the same act under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1641. The test was whether, if the elements of one charge were eliminated, the remaining facts would support the other charge. Since the same act of holding a gun on the victim to cause fear was necessary for both charges, the lesser conviction of assault with a deadly weapon had to be set aside. The crime of the murder of the second victim was composed of entirely separate acts from the robbery of the first victim, so conviction for both did not constitute double punishment. Although the bifurcated trial requirement in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1621.01 had been held unconstitutional, that ruling did not apply retrospectively. Defendant did not show he had been prejudiced by the bifurcated trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the assault conviction and reduced the death sentence to life imprisonment. Otherwise, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found no intentional, arbitrary, or systematic discrimination against 18 to 21 year olds from serving on the jury. The delay in implementing a federal requirement that 18 year olds and over be placed on the voter registration list did not invalidate a jury list taken from the voter roles prior to the time voters 18 to 21 were allowed to register. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to a jury which was composed of, with mathematical precision, the exact proportion of his race as existed in the general population. The jury's determination of both guilt and punishment in a single trial procedure was not unconstitutional. Applying the identical elements test, the court held that under Ariz. Rev.

Const. art. 6, &sect; 5(1), taxpayers sought to prohibit the state from imposing certain real property rental taxes. The taxpayers owned shopping centers and, as landlords, had entered into written leases on the real property. Thus, the property was subject to the Act, which imposed a tax on the business of leasing or renting real property. The court found no constitutional infirmities in the Act and upheld the tax. The court held that the privilege tax was not a property tax and upheld the tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-1314 (A) did not violate due process because it was not a retroactive tax. Further, the tax did not impair the obligation of contracts under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10(1) and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 25 because the contracts were executory in that performance would be taking place for many years to come. It is the receipt of rentals by the taxpayers, not the leases out of which the rentals arise, which were the taxable events. A taxable event was the realization of income.</SPAN></P>

When they stopped for the night, defendant decided to shoot the victim and take his money. He hitchhiked to another state. About a year later, he turned himself in to the police and was extradited. Defendant was represented by appointed counsel. Defendant was examined by two physicians pursuant to a motion for mental examination under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1621. He was found competent to stand trial. Defense counsel requested the appointment of a psychiatrist, which was denied with the right to refile the motion. About a month before trial, defendant sought to enter a guilty plea, which he did against the advice of counsel. Affirming, the court concluded that since defendant was competent to stand trial, he was competent to enter a guilty plea. Under Ariz. Rev.

A guilty plea waived all non-jurisdictional defenses, including not guilty by reason of insanity.

The citizens' committee appealed on three issues: whether the cancellation of registrations pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-103 and 16-151 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Arizona and the United States Constitutions, whether the application of Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple offenses. He challenged the prior conviction judgment. Defendant claimed and the State admitted that the only evidence of the existence of the prior conviction occurred in a colloquy between defendant and the prosecuting attorney, while defendant was on the witness stand, in which defendant admitted that he had been convicted of the felony of burglary. Records of this prior conviction had been submitted to defense counsel as was required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-1649, -1650. Affirming, the court took judicial notice of the records of the superior court that entered defendant's plea of guilty to burglary and found that the place and date of the conviction matched the place and date in the charge. The court ruled that because defendant admitted the prior felony conviction, proof became unnecessary. The court observed that although use of a prior conviction to enhance a punishment required defendant to be represented or to have waived his right to counsel, the file for the burglary conviction showed that defendant, in the presence of counsel, withdrew a plea of not and voluntarily and knowingly entered a plea of guilty to the charge.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by denying defendant's motion to suppress the physical evidence because probable cause existed based on the warrant affidavit. Further, the motion to suppress defendant's statements was properly denied, although several of defendant's statements were deleted, because defendant made no offer of proof as to whether the omissions were material to proving his innocence. Moreover, a change of venue was not necessary because there was no showing that the character of the publicity was inflammatory or that the jury formed any preconceived beliefs. Accordingly, defendant's conviction was proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after an undercover agent observed him sharing a marijuana cigarette with other individuals and discussed a possible drug purchase. On appeal, defendant asserted that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1002.07, under which he was convicted, violated the Equal Protection Clause because marijuana was classified as a &quot;narcotic drug,&quot; pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1001(14), rather than a &quot;dangerous drug,&quot; set forth under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1901(9). The court noted that the furnishing of marijuana, though included in the narcotic section, was punished less severely than the sale of other narcotics, but more severely than dangerous drugs. The court concluded that the classification was reasonable and not arbitrary. The states had broad discretion in enacting laws and that discretion was abused only if the classification was wholly irrelevant to achievement of the objective. The legislative intent was to proscribe the use of marijuana, and there was a reasonable basis for the classification of marijuana with narcotic drugs, rather than dangerous drugs. Further, the desire to impose a stiffer penalty due to widespread use was also a valid reason for the classification.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the matter had to be returned to court for an evidentiary hearing to determine if he knew how much time he might have had to spend in prison when he pled guilty. Then, in considering the constitutionality issue, the court found no constitutional infirmity. The court that &sect; 13-249(B) was not unconstitutionally vague merely because it used the same words &quot;deadly weapon&quot; as in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-249(A), and words which had the same meaning as deadly weapon, &quot;a gun,&quot; in describing what would be increased punishment. Further, the court held that defendant could be sentenced as an aider and abettor under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-249(B) even though he allegedly id not fire the gun.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-1521, -1522, and -1571. Due to recent developments in this field of law and because it was a matter of general interest and importance throughout Arizona, the court accepted jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The roofing company filed an action against a construction company, its owners, a corporation, and an insurance company as a result of an expressed open account contract for the direct payment of money. At the time of filing the complaint, the roofing company asked the clerk to issue a writ of general attachment and writ of garnishment, which the clerk refused to issue. The court held that it would continue to uphold the garnishment and attachment statutes of Arizona, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-1521, -1522, and -1571, wherein wages were not involved. The court ordered that the issuance of the mandate would constitute an order that the clerk issue the writ of general attachment and garnishment in the underlying action. In granting the relief sought, the court reviewed a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that prejudgment garnishment procedures whereby a defendant's wages were frozen in the interim between the garnishment of the wages and the determination of the lawsuit without the defendant having a chance to be heard prior to the garnishment, violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Such holding, however, was limited to the prejudgment garnishment of wages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board approved the land company's application to rezone approximately 3,840 acres of land owned by it to permit a major development which included both residential and commercial uses.

The trial court denied relief. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the trial court did not err in denying the injunctive relief because the trial court was without jurisdiction under Ariz. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Board of Supervisors sought special action regarding an order from the Superior Court (Arizona), which ruled that the residency requirement in Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-297 was unconstitutional and that all indigent persons in the county, particularly respondent indigent, were entitled to medical care at the county hospital irrespective of length of county residency. The issue was whether a residency requirement violated the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indigent required continued medical care to preserve his health and well being, but his medical condition was not an emergency case needing immediate hospital or medical care, and he had not been a county resident for 12 months before needing medical care or at the time of filing the action in the trial court. The hospital at which the indigent was treated joined with the indigent in the action to compel the Board to accept the indigent as a patient at the county hospital and to pay the first hospital for the care it had furnished. On review, the court explained that the county residency requirement for non-emergency medical treatment did not discriminate in favor of Arizona residents; the requirement applied to all citizens within the state including long-term residents of one county who moved to another county. The court concluded that the classification did not single out non-residents nor attempt to penalize interstate travel. The court pointed out that the matter at issue did not deal with such fundamental rights as speech or voting, but it fell within the permissible area of reasonable regulation. By the rational basis standard, the court found the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's judgment, which had held that imposing a residency requirement on an indigent for medical care at a county hospital was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was to be tried jointly with his brother. After a trial date was set in defendant's presence, he escaped from jail and did not appear at trial. Defendant was tried in absentia, was convicted of the crime charged, and was found guilty of two prior convictions. On certified questions from the trial court, the court ruled: (1) because defendant was aware of his trial date and failed to appear, his non-appearance was voluntary, and thus he could be tried in absentia, under Ariz. R. Crim. P. 231. Defendant knew that he had a right to be present and failed to show that he did not voluntarily elect to waive that right, thus it was immaterial that defendant was unaware that trial could proceed without him; (2) for purposes of enhanced sentencing under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1002, the trial court did not have inherent power to strike or dismiss the prior convictions and treat defendant as a first time offender; and (3) under &sect; 36-1002.07(C), the minimum 10-year sentence that was applicable to defendant's third conviction was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, asserting that he was an adult, unemployed student at a community college and that he was confined in county jail at the time the application was filed. The prisoner was arrested and charged with shoplifting, a misdemeanor. On his plea of guilty, the prisoner was sentenced to pay a fine or be imprisoned for 40 days in the jail. He could not pay the fine and was sent to jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner argued that the municipal court automatically converted the fine to a jail term because he could not immediately pay the fine in full. The case was to be sent to a superior court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the prisoner was indigent at the time of sentencing. The sentencing judge testified at the hearing that the prisoner told the judge that he was in no condition to pay the fine and that usually an indigent was allowed six months to pay but that the prisoner said he could not pay in installments. The prisoner stated that he would work to pay the fine. The superior court found that the prisoner was not indigent under the commonly accepted definition of the term. The court disagreed, finding that there was a constitutional defect inherent in jailing an indigent for failing to make immediate payment of a fine. A reasonable opportunity to discharge the fine had to be given before the alternative of imprisonment was invoked. The court adopted the American Bar Association's Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures, &sect; 2.7(b) and (c), which authorized the courts to permit payment of fines by installment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the prisoner's application, and the stay of the proceedings was vacated. The prisoner was ordered returned to the municipal court with directions that he be given an appropriate time period within which to pay any fine imposed after an allowance for the eight days which he served in jail and that upon failure to comply with the order for the payment of the fine, he would be recommitted to jail to serve the alternative sentence.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the court reversed the finding that the one-year residency requirement was unconstitutional under Ariz. Const. art. 11, &sect; 6. On transfer from the court of appeals, the court held that the board was within its rights to disregard some of the students' testimony and to classify all but one as nonresidents. The trial court had used the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof. However, the clear and convincing evidence standard should have been used. None of the students' proof, save for one student, was clear and convincing that the students had the intent and evidence to show that they were residents. The court specifically reviewed the other state income tax refunds filed by the students, where their driver's licenses originated, and what the students had stated on their student loan applications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State Tax Commission challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Yavapai County, Arizona, which granted summary judgment to appellees, a corporation and its stockholders, adjudging that the Commission was not entitled to recover any taxes arising out of a deficient income tax assessment. The principal issue was whether individual stockholders could be held personally liable for the dissolved corporation's tax liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the corporation dissolved, all assets were transferred to stockholders within one year, and the corporation filed a State tax return which did not report as taxable income the capital gain from selling its assets. The question was whether the Arizona Income Tax Act before amendment was construed to permit taxing capital gains from selling corporate assets where within 12 months the proceeds were distributed to stockholders in complete liquidation. The court noted that although Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-155c did not say that a liquidated corporation had to pay tax, placing it only on a distributee, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-102b required taxing all net income unless otherwise provided. The court pointed out that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-152o was plain and unambiguous and could only mean that where a corporation adopted liquidation after December 31, 1969, no gain in corporate income was recognized if distributed within 12 months. The court concluded there was no unconstitutional double taxation because the stockholders knew the Commission did not issue a clearance certificate and was questioning its tax return, and the stockholders accepted the risk of subsequent corporate tax liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had adjudged that the Commission was not entitled to recover any taxes from the stockholders, and it remanded the matter for proceedings consistent with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trade association's principal challenge to the constitutionality of the home solicitation law was based on the theory that it was arbitrary and unreasonable to place home solicitation sales in a different category from sales made to the public at a fixed place of business. The court reversed the judgment and ordered the superior court to grant the state's motion for summary judgment. The court held that the door-to-door segment of the retailing industry was a proper subject for separate classification and regulation. The court also rejected the trade association's challenge based on the theory that the state had no right to make notes and other evidences of indebtedness non-negotiable or to provide that defenses against the seller should remain valid against the seller's transferee. The court refused to consider several of the trade association's remaining arguments because it was impossible to adjudicate with positiveness claims that had not arisen. The court, thus, held that the statute was in general constitutional, subject to the questions that were not inherently involved in the instant action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was before the court on a petition for review of a decision of a court of appeals (Arizona), which affirmed an order of a superior court refusing to vacate an injunction previously issued against appellant, the City of Tucson, Arizona, preventing it from enforcing against plaintiff arrestees an ordinance prohibiting dancers and waitresses from appearing with bare breasts unless their nipples was covered by &quot;pasties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City prosecuted a dancer under the ordinance. A city magistrate held the ordinance unconstitutional. The City took the case to superior court by certiorari, where the writ was denied on the ground that the case should have come to that court by appeal. The time for appeal had passed, so the magistrate's finding became final and the only way the City could get a decision from a higher court was to make new arrests, which it did. The arrestees made common cause and started the instant action against the City, asking that enforcement of the ordinance be enjoined. The injunction complaint in a roundabout way alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The superior court granted a temporary injunction and denied the City's motion to dissolve the injunction. The court of appeals affirmed without remand, which made it impossible for the City to make a new arrest and bring the matter properly before the superior court, since it had been enjoined from doing so. On the instant appeal, the court held that since the issue of constitutionality was raised by the City at the hearing on the motion to dissolve, the City should have been given its day in court on the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with instructions to modify the injunction to permit the prosecution of the arrestees. At the trial, the issue of the constitutionality of the ordinance could be raised, briefed, decided, and appealed if the parties so desired. If the ordinance was held to be constitutional, the injunction, as modified, was to be dissolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the incorporators obtained zoning permission for the construction and operation of a cemetery, the department refused to issue a certificate of authority to the incorporators for such an operation. On review, the commissioner denied the certificate on the ground that the area was adequately served, and the incorporators sought review, under the Administrative Review Act. The trial court reversed the determination of the commissioner, and appellants sought review. On appeal, the incorporators contended that the department had abused its discretion in determining that the area was adequately served. The court reviewed the judgment of the trial court under a clearly erroneous standard of review and affirmed its judgment that was in favor of the appellees. The court rejected the department's contention, finding evidence that tended to show that the seven and one-half mile radius raised by the incorporators was the actual area to be served. The court found that the department had failed to consider the convenience factor. The court also found that appellants did not present evidence that controverted the incorporators' seven and one-half mile radius as the area to be served.</SPAN></P>

The employees' workman's compensation benefits awarded were reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees argued that the interpretation given to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1023 (1965) by the appellate court violated Ariz. Const. art 18, &sect; 6. The court granted jurisdiction because the question of the constitutionality of a vital provision of the Workman's Compensation Act was an issue of general statewide significance. The employees alleged that the interpretation given to &sect; 23-1023 by the appellate court violated the constitution because the injured employee's third party action was preserved only if the injured employee was willing to relinquish to the compensation insurance carrier damages beyond actual damages. The court vacated the appellate court's judgment and affirmed the workman's compensation awards. The court held that there was actually no limitation on the amount of recovery by an injured employee but there was a reimbursement to the workmen's compensation commission for the compensation and accident benefits advanced. If the employees were not allowed to pursue the actions against the third party tortfeasors then they would not have had the right to an election as provided by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that such an interpretation of the law was far too restrictive and narrow and that a petition to reopen could be granted upon the showing of either a change of physical condition, under Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that he should have been allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty and whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-453, as it related to sentencing on a guilty plea for murder in the first degree and was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous. The court held that the superior court properly accepted defendant's plea of guilty. The record supported that it was freely and voluntarily made. However, the superior court abused its discretion in refusing to permit defendant to withdraw his plea because defendant may have been misled by the superior court into thinking that the result of the plea would be different from what actually transpired. He may have believed that he would receive a life sentence as opposed to a death sentence. The court found that the prosecutor's decision to drop the additional charges must have been misleading to defendant, and, together with the extended conversation by the superior court on how many years a person would have to serve on a life sentence, led defendant to expect a life sentence. The court concluded that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-453 was constitutional and that the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the cause to the superior court and ordered that: (1) if the State desired to try defendant for the crime as charged calling for the death penalty and including the charges that were dropped, then the plea of guilty would be set aside and a new trial ordered; or (2) if the State did not wish to proceed to trial, then the plea of guilty would remain, the death sentence would be set aside, and a life sentence would be imposed.</SPAN></P>

The driver filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and the lower court granted the motion. The court affirmed the order, holding that the brother, sister, and foster parents did not have a statutory right to be party plaintiffs to the wrongful death action because Ariz. Rev.

The court also held that the brother, sister, and foster parents did not have the right to recover damages because they were not beneficiaries of the deceased, as defined in &sect; 12-612(A). Finally, the court held that the denial of the foster parents' right to recovery was not unconstitutional because although they stood in loco parentis with the deceased, they were not his &quot;parents&quot; as defined in Ariz.

The court also held that it could not find that the trial court was the inappropriate forum based on the factually incomplete record and that the garnishment was constitutional because the court's previous ruling finding a garnishment unconstitutional was limited to garnishment of wages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The attorney general refused to approve the resolution, contending that the act was unconstitutional. The court agreed, finding that the act contravened Ariz. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13 because it failed to provide for prior electorate approval of the bonds sought to be issued. The bonds sought to be issued were general obligation bonds and not revenue bonds exempt from the prior electorate approval requirement. Even though the bond was payable only from revenues derived from the operation of the transit authority, the legislature transformed the bond into a general obligation bond by pledging the general taxing power of the City of Tucson to supplement the income of the transit authority in covering its expenses. Further, the transit authority was a public service corporation and was not exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

First, defendant was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and given a suspended sentence on condition that he was a law-abiding citizen and voluntarily reported to a sanitarium.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant plead guilty to assault with intent to commit rape. He was given a suspended sentence of five years on condition that he was a law-abiding citizen and voluntarily reported to a sanitarium. Defendant was then charged with kidnapping and statutory rape. He plead guilty to both offenses. Defendant was sentenced to 20 years for the rape, life without possibility of parole for the kidnapping, and the sentences were to run consecutively. Defendant's probation in the first case was revoked and a sentence of 10 to 14 years was imposed to run consecutive to the other two sentences. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court's sentencing of him was improper and that there was insufficient evidence to support an independent conviction for kidnapping where the acts relating to the kidnapping and the rape were so intertwined. The court ruled that the trial court's sentencing of defendant was proper where all of the sentences were within the statutory limits. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support an independent kidnapping conviction because defendant's act of luring the infant victim from her yard into his car preceded and was complete before the rape took place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter filed with the Secretary of State his intention to circulate throughout the State an initiative petition to have placed on the ballot at the next general election a measure to amend Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-702. The petition was to have been circulated pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 1, &sect; 1(2). However, the voter argued that cancellation by the county recorder of all voter registrations on the day immediately following general elections operated to unconstitutionally deprive him of his constitutionally guaranteed right of initiative by eliminating the entire class of persons eligible to sign his petition, who were qualified electors, until they had re-qualified by re-registering. On consideration of the issue, the court decided to grant the voter's request to prohibit the destruction of the records from the last election but declined to declare Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-150(D) unconstitutional. Specifically, the court held that the various county recorders could not, as Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-144 indicated, destroy the affidavits of registration.

A mistrial was declared after one juror was committed to move to another state. A new jury convicted defendant and he appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the motion to suppress defendant's statements to police and evidence seized from his home was properly denied because defendant was adequately advised of his rights in Spanish and English. There was no showing of prejudice from the one-day delay between arrest and arraignment. The second trial, subsequent to the mistrial declared, did not constitute double jeopardy because jeopardy had not attached and the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in granting a mistrial where long delays were expected and one juror was moving. There was no error in refusing to furnish an expert in Spanish to defendant, an indigent, because there was no evidence of inadequate translation or prejudice. Finally, the refusal to instruct on involuntary manslaughter was not error because there was evidence of a sudden quarrel or heat of passion, warranting an instruction on voluntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

He was tried by a jury and convicted of murder in the first degree. He appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. On remand, defendant entered a plea of &quot;guilty&quot; to an amended information charging him with voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence introduced at their joint trial showed that defendant had assisted his co-defendant in burglarizing a gas station. Shortly after doing so, they returned to retrieve a bottle of beer. At this point in time, a police officer arrived on the scene. As he approached the two suspects, the co-defendant attacked the officer, disarmed him, and beat him. Thereafter, defendant and the co-defendant took their turn in shooting the police officer. On appeal, defendant argued that he was unconstitutionally denied credit for time previously served under his first conviction when the trial court imposed the maximum sentence on the second conviction and did not subtract therefrom credit for the previous time served. The court held that: (1) it was quite evident from a careful reading of the record that the trial court fully intended to credit defendant for time already served; (2) in fact, the trial court stated plainly and unequivocally that it would take into consideration, in imposing sentence, time already served; (3) that the trial court might have been more explicit in wording the sentence was not error, especially since the trial court's meaning was easily established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission argued that its rate-making orders were not subject to judicial review by a special action in the superior court. On consideration of the issue, the court decided to grant the petition for relief. Specifically, the court first determined that the jurisdiction of the court over extraordinary writs to state officers was not exclusive, but was concurrent with that of the superior courts. Thus, the court held that the proceedings were properly filed in the superior court. Nevertheless, because the Commission's rate-making power was a legislative function, which was not subject to review, the court ultimately concluded that special action relief had not been available to review the Commission's rate-making decisions, pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14. Lastly, the court addressed the water company's argument that review of the rate-making orders should have been available because the review procedure available under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-254 was unconstitutional. However, the court noted that since the water company made no attempt to avail itself of relief under &sect; 40-254, it could not challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-691(A) after being arrested for driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Arizona's Implied Consent Law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-691(A), did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination because the refusal to submit to the chemical test itself was not &quot;testimonial communication,&quot; so that comment upon such refusal was not improper. Further, the court determined that the statute did not violate due process because there existed a compelling public interest in the immediate removal of dangerous drivers from the highways of the state pending investigation and review. Miranda warnings were not applicable in the case before the court as the driver was detained no longer than necessary to make out the citation and have it signed. The court also ruled that a refusal to submit to a chemical test occurred where the conduct of the arrested motorist was such that a reasonable person in the officer's position would have been justified in believing that such motorist was capable of refusal and manifested an unwillingness to submit to the test. Finally, the officer had probable cause to make a warrantless arrest because he had reasonable grounds to believe that respondent was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1967, Arizona's legislature revised many of its tax laws. A legislative scheme assessing real and personal property by classes for taxation purposes was adopted. By Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-136, the legislature for tax purposes placed all real and personal property in Arizona in four classes. The real and personal property of railroad companies used in the continuous operation of a railroad was placed in Class One. By Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-227(B)(1) for tax purposes Class One properties were assessed at 60 percent of their full cash value. The railroads sought to recover the ad valorem property taxes paid under protest. On appeal of the superior court's reduction of the assessed value, the court reversed with directions to enter judgments in favor of the counties. The court held that the superior court's judgment directing that the railroads be treated as though their properties were in Class Two was, in effect, a judicial reclassification that was palpably unconstitutional and void because only the legislature had the authority to classify property for tax purposes. The court ruled that the superior court could not legislate; its duty was to construe the law as written.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had previously found Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1621.01 was unconstitutional as it related to a bifurcated trial in cases where defendants were found not guilty by reason of insanity. The court found that it should not permanently restrain the trial court from proceeding with a trial to determine if respondent should be released. It reasoned that the procedure to be followed in the bifurcated trial would violate due process of law and the earlier decision was necessarily prospective in its application. The court found that certain provisions of a statute may remain viable despite the fact that other clauses were declared unconstitutional provided that the provisions were easily separable from the tainted parts and that they materially advance the causes of justice. Here, the provisions in question were obviously separable from the invalid portions of the section. It set forth the various provisions that were separable and capable of independent enforcement.

The court answered in the affirmative, holding that the statute clearly apprised one that certain conduct, when done maliciously and willfully, was punishable and that it did so in words easily understood and definable. The statute also did not infringe upon free speech as it prohibited speech that did not convey a communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the Constitution.

The court denied the writ, ruling that the bail condition that he conduct himself as a law abiding citizen comported with &sect; 13-1577(D). The court also held that &sect; 13-1577 et seq., was constitutional. The court reviewed state and federal bail statutes and the state constitution, concluding that imposing conditions on bail was permissible. It struck a fair balance between the individual's freedom and the state's interest in seeing that complete justice was done. Bail was not required by the Eighth Amendment, nor by the Bail Reform Act of 1966, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3146 et seq., nor by state statute.

Six days later police came to her home and arrested her for passing bad checks. She pled guilty and was sentenced to two consecutive sentences of one to five years in state prison. When she was arrested, her husband took the child to his half sister and her husband, who agreed to care for the child. A year and a half later, they filed a petition for adoption. The natural father died before the hearing. The natural mother objected to the adoption and provided evidence that she would be able to care for the child when she was released. The trial court entered an interlocutory order in favor of the adopting parents, which the appeals court reversed. On appeal, the court vacated the order from the appeals court and affirmed the order from the trial court. The court found that the baby was a &quot;dependent child&quot; under Ariz. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was civilly committed to a psychiatric hospital due to a suicide attempt when he was formally charged with robbery. Ultimately brought to trial after a period of incompetency, defendant invoked Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;13-1621 to prove he was legally insane. At the bifurcated trial where the first trial established his guilt and the second trial established his sanity, the trial court admitted the testimony of defendant's psychiatrist. The court held that the psychiatrist was defendant's treating physician and admission of his testimony regarding defendant was clear prejudicial error, contrary to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1802, and required a new trial. The court also found Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1621 unconstitutional because the statute precluded evidence as to defendant's criminal intent in the guilt phase of the trial. In other words, whether defendant had the requisite criminal intent could not be considered by the jury and was impermissibly simply presumed for purpose of the trial. Holding that this was a denial of due process, the court set aside the judgment of both trials, reinstated the procedure prior to &sect;13-1621, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court held that permitting only property taxpayers to vote violated equal protection. Following this decision, to avoid any conflict between Ariz. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13 and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-1302(D) and the Fourteenth Amendment, the school district called dual elections to seek authority for the issuance of school improvement bonds. In one election, only real property taxpayers were allowed to vote; in the other, all qualified electors were allowed to vote. In both elections, a majority voted to issue the bonds. The court stated that it was unnecessary to reach the question of whether the statute or the constitutional provision violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Arizona legislature had passed S.B. 34, ch. 55, 29th Leg., 2d Reg. Sess. (Ariz.), which took effect in 1970 and provided that if a statute or state constitutional provision that restricted voting in an election to real property taxpayers violated the U.S. Constitution, any other election which would have been valid should be deemed so. This bill was plainly intended to be retrospective. Thus, one or the other of the elections here would be valid, requiring issuance of the bonds.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the evidence had been offered to show that defendant knew that the cigarette he gave to the agent was indeed marijuana. Moreover, any error was harmless because in view of defendant's own testimony, the jury would have convicted him had the evidence in question been excluded. The court rejected defendant's argument that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1002.07, which prohibited the sale or furnishing of marijuana, was unconstitutional. The power of the State to regulate narcotic drug traffic within its borders was manifestly in the interest of the public health and welfare. The court also held that the statute plainly prohibited giving away marijuana, even one cigarette. Next, the court held that the fact that a government agent offered to buy narcotics from a suspect did not constitute entrapment. Finally, the court held that defendant's sentence was not cruel and excessive. It was the shortest possible sentence allowed by the statute, and a sentence within the statutory limits would not be modified unless clearly excessive.</SPAN></P>

Responding to that contention, the court held that the act of masturbation by one adult male upon another adult male was an act committed in an unnatural manner. The court's only mission was to interpret the statute as enacted by the legislature. In contemporary Arizona, and as of the date the statute was last amended in 1965, homosexual activity was considered unnatural. The court concluded that the acts of defendants were lewd and lascivious.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the worker's compensation statute did not bar petitioners' right to sue the fellow employees.

The court also determined that defendant's trial was not in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. V's protection against double jeopardy, because defendant's first trial was reversed due to constitutional errors, and therefore defendant was never put into jeopardy twice for the same offense. Finally, the court concluded that the imposition of death upon defendant was not unconstitutional or illegal, but because defendant was a minor, his sentence was to be reduced to life imprisonment.

The court held that an automobile could not be forfeited under &sect; 36-1041 unless the owner had some connection with the unlawful act, intended to permit the automobile to be used by a third person in the commission of the unlawful act, or had knowledge it was to be so used. The court found that the evidence was uncontradicted that the owner permitted her son to use the automobile to go to and from school and to the library, and no evidence was presented by the state that she had knowledge or reason to believe the automobile would be used for an illegal purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his arrest, defendant was transferred to the state hospital. At an Ariz. R.

The hospital released him three times after this, and the first two hearings were held with the same result. The fourth hearing was requested but never held. Defendant was brought to trial on the charges at which time defendant and his counsel stated that they believed he was capable of standing trial and waived the right to have a further hearing on the issue. Defendant pled guilty under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1621 et seq. and was convicted of robbery and assault with intent to commit murder. The court found that the statute was not a legislative usurpation of the state supreme court's rulemaking power because the rules were statutory and accompanied the newly created statutory rights and were thus necessary. The lower court committed reversible error in requiring defendant to carry the burden of proof of insanity and in permitting defendant to waive his rights because a hearing on defendant's sanity was mandatory under the statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly instructed the jury as to the test for criminal responsibility. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it could consider evidence of defendant's mental condition in determining whether he, in fact, entertained premeditation and deliberation. The court ruled that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-453, which prescribed the punishment for murder, was constitutional and its authorization of the imposition of the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court did not err in excusing a juror for cause because the juror expressed more than conscientious scruples against the infliction of the death penalty. The juror stated specifically that even if she felt the case warranted it she would be prevented from imposing death by her moral or religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised three issues in his appeal. He asserted that his counsel's waiver of a jury trial was invalid because the trial court failed to examine defendant as to whether he agreed to waiver of the jury. Defendant also asserted that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that he was not identified as the perpetrator of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed the conviction. Defendant's counsel waived a jury trial in open court with defendant present. By permitting his counsel to waive a jury trial in his presence and without objection, defendant acquiesced in the waiver. Defendant had no right to be personally questioned on the issue. Defendant failed to point to any specific prejudice caused by the fact that both he and a co-defendant were represented by public defenders from the same office. Without such a showing, defendant's claim of ineffective counsel failed. And, the victim's identification of defendant, which consisted of pointing to defendant and saying defendant was one of the men that committed the robbery, was sufficient as an eyewitness identification.</SPAN></P>

The superintendent refused to draw a warrant the second time the district made the request and adjusted his records so that the first request was charged against bond funds and not levy funds.

In response, the competitor filed a petition for a writ of prohibition that sought to prevent the airline from taking any action upon the airline's complaint. Following the judgment that granted the competitor's petition for writ of prohibition, the airline appealed. The issue raised was whether a common carrier by aircraft had to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the commission before engaging in the business of transportation of property or passengers for hire. The court reversed the order, holding that Ariz. Const. art. XV, &sect; 10, coupled with Ariz. Const. art. XV, &sect; 3, showed that it was the intent of the framers of the constitution to place all common carriers under the same regulations. Further, the court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-205 was not in conflict with Ariz. Const. art. XV. The court further held that Ariz. Rev.

The arresting officer investigated the scene and determined who had been driving the vehicles.

The arresting officer also observed that the driver's attitude toward the officer was varied, that his speech was slurred and confused, and that his balance was poor. The driver on several occasions fell down. The officer arrested the driver for failure to control his vehicle to avoid a collision and for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquors.

Defendant's plea was also entered voluntarily without coercion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Arizona), which convicted him of possession of a narcotic drug in violation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1002. Defendant claimed that punishment of an addict for the possession of narcotic drugs was cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant also claimed that the evidence should have been suppressed because police failed to comply with Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1446 when executing the search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he had been an addict for 25 years. A prior Supreme Court opinion held that criminalizing the status of being an addict was unconstitutional. Defendant argued that because possession was a necessary corollary to addiction, punishing an addict for possession was also unconstitutional. The court disagreed and noted that the power of the states to control and criminalize drug possession was well established. The cruel and unusual punishment clause was properly considered only as to the nature of the punishment, not as to the crime being punished. Defendant's second argument was that his motion to suppress evidence should have been granted because the police violated Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-1446(B) when they entered defendant's home without first announcing their presence. There was no judicial exception that had been created in Arizona that relieved police from fulfilling the knock and announcement requirement in narcotics cases. The court held that to avoid operation of the statute by a judicially created exception, there must be substantial evidence that would cause the officers to believe that evidence would be destroyed if their presence was announced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion that the motion to suppress evidence should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. Defendant testified in detail about the number of drinks he had and the &quot;DT's&quot; he experienced, but then claimed that he was unconscious and unable to realize what he was doing when he waived his rights. Defendant never raised an issue of voluntariness and the evidence did not present the issue such the trial court would have been required to hold a hearing on the issue sua sponte. The arrest was brought about by defendant's voluntary actions. He did not testify that he was coerced in any way by police.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners filed complaints seeking to determine the legality of a property tax classification system as it applied to them. The two types of property involved were airlines and tank cars. The court made permanent the writ of prohibition applied for by the commission. Nowhere in the statutes applying to those two classes of property did the court find any procedures set up wherein a taxpayer could question either the amount of the tax or the legality of the tax itself. The owners contended that they were being denied due process because no hearing or appeal procedure had been set up for them to protest the valuation of their property, the method of assessment, or to attack the validity of the tax itself. Under the circumstances, the court held that payment of taxes under protest would have been involuntary payment. The court also held that when there was no semblance of authority for the imposition of a tax, or the mode of assessment produced discriminatory inequality on the same class of property, an injunction would lie. The court concluded that involuntary payment of taxes under protest was a condition precedent to the bringing of an action to recover such taxes.</SPAN></P>

The jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages. The newspaper also appealed the denial of motions to set aside the verdict and judgment for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The editorial blatantly insinuated that the state attorney was a communist or at least a sympathizer. The court found no error in the ruling that the editorial was libelous per se because it was settled law that charging someone with being a communist sympathizer was libelous on its face. However, a public official could not recover damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he could prove the statement was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of actual malice because the charge that the state attorney was a communist was clearly a gross untruth. However, reversal and retrial were nonetheless necessary because the trial court's instruction on actual malice was fatally defective in that it allowed the jury to infer malice from an absence of proper caution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge sought a writ of prohibition on several grounds, one of which was the averred unconstitutionality of &sect; 13-1021. Finding the issue dispositive of the case, the court granted a permanent writ of prohibition after determining that the statute was vague and uncertain and that to endeavor to enforce it would have deprived the judge of equal protection of the law. Specifically, the court held that while the court readily acknowledged a compelling public interest in prohibiting public officers or employees from coercing or commanding other such officers or employees into making political contributions, the court did not believe that the legislature could constitutionally, broadly restrict the right of one individual to ask or inquire of another if he would have liked to make a political contribution. In addition, the court held that aside from the vagueness and uncertainty of the statute and the apparent infringement on fundamental political rights and freedom of speech, the statute was unconstitutional because of the degree of punishment that was entirely out of proportion to the gravity of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant sought to quash the information because the instruments allegedly used by defendant were not mechanical devices or contrivances as contemplated under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-303. Upon defendant's motion, the trial court then certified its questions. In answering the certified questions, the court held that &sect; 13-303 was not ambiguous and that a crow bar, a pry bar, a brace and bit, screw drivers, and a jimmy bar all fell within the ambit of &sect; 13-303. The court further held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-304 did not delimit the instruments, devices, tools, and contrivances the possession of which were punishable under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-303. Additionally, the court held that &sect; 13-303 was constitutional and noted that a cursory reading of &sect; 13-303 sufficiently apprised defendant of the acts that were proscribed by its terms.</SPAN></P>

When the officers told him to stop, he disappeared. Subsequently, codefendant left the building through a broken window, but was apprehended. In the meantime, defendant tried to exit from the same hole in the roof, but was caught. The officers found crow bars and sledge hammers used in an attempt to open a safe in the store. The State introduced a picture of the door of the safe. The owner of the safe testified that it showed marks that were not on the door when he locked up his store the evening before. The court held that &sect; 13-303 was constitutional, finding that the tools that were found in the building were of the kind that defendant was able to use for an unlawful purpose. The court further held that there was no doubt that the jury was able to find that defendant used the tools in an attempt to open the safe.

The superior court found that the security corporation was engaged in the business of protecting, in transit, money and valuables transported by it in armored cars, but that the function of transportation was incidental to the prime function which was the physical protection of the property transported; it held that the commission acted in excess of its jurisdiction. The appellate court reversed and reinstated the commission's findings. On appeal, the court vacated that decision, holding that the security corporation was not acting either as a common carrier or a contract carrier. The court noted that the security corporation did not hold itself out as willing to haul for all potential customers without discrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff supplier filed an action against defendants, contractor and surety, to recover money owed by defendants' subcontractor to plaintiff under a highway construction contract. The court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that liability was created when defendant contractor voluntarily entered into a performance bond. While state statute required a performance bond, it did not spell out details of the bond's contents. Therefore, liability rested on the terms of the bond. The intent of the parties in entering into the bond agreement was not to exclude a supplier of a subcontractor from protection under the bond. Plaintiff did not delay in filing its claim so as to be guilty of laches.

The court set aside defendant's sentence and remanded his cause for sentencing, holding that the procedure followed by the trial court was improper and in violation of statutory mandates. The court found that the trial court did not have authority to order a jury to be empaneled to sit for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed on defendant after his plea of guilty to first-degree murder charges because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-453 was clear that when a defendant pleaded guilty, the court was required to determine his punishment.

Defendant argued that the rule permitting the trial court to fix a base maximum and to sentence defendant to one-half of it under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-110 for the attempted murder conviction was an unjustified burden upon defendant who entered a guilty plea. The court held that the penalty for defendant's conviction was imprisonment for not less than 10 years and for a maximum of life. As such, the court held that the attempt to commit murder carried a penalty of not less than five years and a maximum penalty of one-half of life. The court further held that, although the period of a lifetime was indefinite and indeterminable, the trial court was able to impliedly find that the longest term for which defendant, under the circumstances, was able to be sentenced for second-degree murder was 40 to 50 years. As such, the court held that the trial court sentenced him appropriately to one-half that time or 20 to 25 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of not less than 25 years to life imprisonment following his conviction on kidnapping charges. Defendant appealed his sentences, contending, among other things, that the sentences were too severe and disproportionate to the crimes involved, considering his age and general character, and that the sentences running consecutively violated his constitutional rights. The court clarified the trial court's sentence by providing that the sentence in each case was to start from the time defendant was delivered to the prison system and, as clarified, affirmed. The court held that the punishment imposed upon defendant was not severe because the sentence would have succeeded in restraining defendant from preventing other crimes. Defendant's history, along with the testimony of the psychiatrists, showed that defendant had a serious character disorder and the sentence imposed was needed to prevent other crimes by defendant. Further, the psychiatrists admitted that any treatment for defendant's rehabilitation had to be made while he was under restraint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed an initiative petition proposing that the subject property and another parcel not be rezoned to the neighborhood commercial district in the one instance or to a shopping center in regard to the other parcel. The residents filed a complaint seeking to enjoin the election. The superior court granted the injunction and the city sought certiorari review. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the superior court. The court found that there was no express authority in the charter provisions for the city or council to voluntarily refer an ordinance. The express language reserved the powers of the initiative and referendum to the electors. The court ruled that the voluntary submission of the ordinance by the city to a special vote of the people, in the absence of a referendum petition therefor, was wholly without authority and outside the delegated powers of the city.</SPAN></P>

It was undisputed that the commitments were ordered without advising the juveniles and their parents of their right to counsel and that no counsel was provided at their hearing. The appellate court ordered the release of the juveniles, holding that a United States Supreme Court decision which held, among other things, that under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment the child and his parent had to be notified of the child's right to be represented by counsel retained by them, or if they were unable to afford counsel that counsel would have been appointed to represent the child, was retroactive as to the questions raised by the juveniles on appeal. The court vacated the appellate court's judgment, holding that because the Supreme Court determined that the due process protection given to adults under the Fourteenth Amendment applied to children in juvenile court proceedings, the Supreme Court intended to achieve the same retrospective effect in cases of all children whose delinquency adjudication and commitment had been accomplished without regard to compliance with the rules established in its decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that it was possible for the state and its agencies to do business with and discharge part of their duties through denominational or sectarian institutions without contravening constitutional prohibitions.

The claims presented by the non-profit corporation and assigned to the Salvation Army represented 40 percent reimbursement for the supplying of food, lodging, clothing, cash assistance, transportation, laundry, and cleaning for the month of April 1967. The court noted that the constitutional prohibitions against furnishing aid or support to any religious worship, exercise, or instruction, and against using public funds to aid any church or private or sectarian school or public service corporation required rigid enforcement. However, because the state was paying less than the actual cost of food, lodging, clothing, transportation, cash assistance, laundry and cleaning given to the destitute in emergency situations, and paying nothing for administration, there was not an unconstitutional aiding of the conduit through which such things were made available.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-652, -653 were not unconstitutionally vague nor did they provide for cruel and unusual punishment; (5) because the offense of fellatio was distinctly separate from the act of child molesting, defendant was not punished twice for the same conduct; and (6) the trial court correctly allowed the State to cross-examine defendant regarding his prior conviction for violation of the Mann Act.</SPAN></P>

The motorist sought to temporarily restrain the officials from suspending his motor vehicle rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist's vehicle collided with a second vehicle and caused it to strike a third. All three were damaged, the motorist was uninsured, and he did not qualify for any exception to the Uniform Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. tit. 28, ch. 7. The Superintendent noticed suspension of the motorist's operating privileges unless he filed satisfactory proof of insurance, release or nonliability or deposited security in a specified amount with proof of future financial responsibility. The motorist filed a release from one party and a security bond in the specified amount before the suspension became effective but refused to show future financial responsibility. He challenged the constitutionality of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1142. The court found that the protection of unwary travelers from future encounters with an uninsured motorist was a constitutional exercise of police power. It found no unconstitutional discrimination in the proof of future financial responsibility requirement, as the distinction rested on the failure to pay for the actual damages inflicted on another on the highway, and no unconstitutional delegation of the legislative function.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the prohibition in the Constitution against imprisonment for debt only applied to debts arising from contract, either express or implied; it did not apply to fines imposed in criminal proceedings for violations of the criminal laws of the State; (2) a sewer rental charge was a debt based on a contractual relationship; sewer rents imposed by the city were neither taxes nor assessments for a local benefit but were charges which the consumer, by accepting the service, impliedly agreed to pay; (3) statutes or ordinances, designed as debt collecting devices under the guise of penal laws, contravened the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt; and (4) as applied, &sect; 29 of Ordinance 207 deprived defendant of a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor and association appealed a decision of the trial court directly to the court, without first appealing in the newly-created appellate court, and the court addressed the question of whether it had jurisdiction over the action. The court found that it had jurisdiction, noting that although the appellate court was given statutory jurisdiction over the case, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20-166 predated that statute and gave the court jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from the trial court. Further, under Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5, the court had appellate jurisdiction over all actions, subject to specific inapplicable exceptions, and further had the power to make procedural rules in any court. Accordingly, the supreme court had jurisdiction over all procedural rules, including appellate procedure. The jurisdiction of the appellate court under 4 Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-120.21 was not exclusive, as that would conflict with Ariz. Const. art. 6, &sect; 5. Constitutionally granted powers may not be limited by legislative enactment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the manufacturer a preliminary injunction restraining the retailer pendente lite from offering to sell the manufacturer's products at a price less than the minimum fair trade price set by the manufacturer. The retailer challenged this decision and presented the question of whether the Fair Trade Act of 1936 (Act), Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 44-1421 to 44-1424, was constitutional as applied to persons not parties to fair trade agreements authorized by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1442. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the Act was not a price fixing act and, therefore, was not in violation of the monopoly provisions of Ariz. Const. art. 14, &sect; 15. Recognizing that the United States Supreme Court was the final arbiter of the constitutionality of the Act, the court held that the Act was not violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court also upheld the validity of the Act with respect to the similar requirement of due process set forth in Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 4. Finally, the court held that the Act, to the extent that it affected a &quot;non-signer&quot; such as the retailer, was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A six-year-old girl testified that defendant had urged her to enter a trailer and there committed acts the jury found to be in violation of Ariz.

Defendant filed a notice of intention to claim alibi, and at trial presented several witnesses who testified that they had been with defendant on the above premises for several hours during the time period in question. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that there was no essential difference between an information and an indictment and there was no due process violation where an information was used in place of an indictment. The Arizona molestation statute was not void for vagueness because it proscribed certain easily recognized acts, which combined with a necessary intent, constituted a violation. Defendant's efforts to establish an alibi defense fell short of the mark. Testimony of others accounted for only part of the time during which the crime was alleged to have been committed. The evidence showed that the remainder of the time, defendant was on the same premises as the victim and in easy access of the trailer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of a trial court (Arizona), which entered a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of attempted robbery, at which time a prior conviction concerning narcotics was admitted. Defendant was sentenced for a period of 10 to 15 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother approached an attendant in the office of the service station where he was employed. Defendant's brother held a gun while defendant ripped the keys to the cash box from the attendant's belt, and then proceeded to open the cash box. The attendant testified that while he did not see defendant actually remove any cash from the box, there was a 10-dollar bill missing after the incident. The robbery was interrupted by the unexpected presence of a police car in the area, and both individuals ran from the station. On appeal, defendant argued that his confession should not have been admitted into evidence. The court found that the trial judge failed to make a definite determination of voluntariness and instead merely found that there was a prima facie showing of voluntariness. For this reason, the court remanded the case for a determination of the voluntariness of defendant's confession. The court found that the exclusion of defendant's alibi witnesses was proper because defendant failed to comply with Ariz. R. Crim. P. 192 even though he knew that he wanted to present an alibi defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the lower court. If the lower court found defendant's confession to be voluntary, and no appeal was filed within 15 days, the court would affirm defendant's conviction. If the lower court found the confession involuntary, the court directed that the lower court should grant defendant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

A lower court dismissed plaintiff's action, finding that the United States was an indispensable party, and that, therefore, the lower court lacked jurisdiction over the action. Plaintiff appealed the lower court's judgment. The court affirmed, concluding that plaintiff was not without remedy, but that plaintiff's remedy did not lie in the court. The court determined that a judicial proceeding against property in which the government had an interest was a suit against the United States, which could not be maintained without its consent. The court found that the United States of America had an interest in the property sought to be condemned, and was an indispensable party to the action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested but, because of a number of mistakes, was not brought to trial until six months after his arrest. On appeal, defendant argued that his right to a speedy trial had been violated. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The trial occurred well within the applicable statute of limitation, which was considered the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges. Defendant had not indicated the names of any witnesses who were unavailable or had disappeared at the date of the trial. Neither did defendant mention any evidence that had been lost or was unavailable at the trial. Thus, defendant was not prejudiced by the passage of time. Defendant was subject to bail and was given credit on his sentence for the time in question. The cumulative effect of these facts demonstrated that defendant was not prejudiced by the delay. The delay was not purposeful on the part of the State. There was nothing in the record to indicate that the State's action was arbitrary, oppressive, or vexatious in the handling of the matter. At most, the delay was accidental, caused by mistaken conclusion as to the law, and was promptly remedied when finally discovered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for diverting campaign contributions for his own use under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-609. Three questions were certified to the court. The court found that Ariz. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2 permitted the court to sit in divisions or in banc, but that it could not declare any law unconstitutional except when sitting in banc, and did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction initially to hear and determine constitutional issues. The court held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-609 was not vague, indefinite, or uncertain, and therefore was constitutional. The court noted that by the use of the words &quot;own use&quot; in the statute, the intent of the legislature was made plain that the objective was to prevent an official from putting more money in his own pocket for personal use or more money in the pocket of another person for personal use, and that there was no double meaning under the statute. The court held that defendant's indictment was not fatally defective as a matter of law because an indictment or information in the language of the statute was sufficient, and because all information could be supplied by a bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1954, the state completed a freeway whose construction blocked a street, leaving owners with a route over undeveloped roads. The owners filed the action in 1962. On appeal, the owners alleged that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-158 was in conflict with Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 and thus unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed, holding that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-158 was a valid and constitutional statutory provision which barred the action. The court held that the owners' right of ingress and egress on the street was not taken or damaged and there was no physical invasion of the owners' property, and that Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 did not contemplate damage incidental to the building of a highway where there was no physical invasion of the owners' property. The legislature may impose a reasonable time within which an action must be brought to recover damages recoverable under a constitutional provision. A two-year statute of limitations was a reasonable time within which a claimant must bring his action to recover for incidental damages incurred where there was no physical invasion of his property by construction of a public highway.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission. The applicant planned to furnish hot or cold chemicals, gases, air, steam, or water for heating or cooling purposes. The Commission's hearing on the application was continued.

The alternative writ of prohibition was granted and made permanent. The writ prohibited the Commission from taking any further steps in connection with the application. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that neither the Arizona Constitution nor any statute gave the Commission the unlimited power to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity. There was no authority to certificate an individual or a corporation in furnishing, for profit, hot or cold air, or steam for heating or cooling purposes.

The trial court found that the rules and regulations adopted by the Board were void and unconstitutional. The Board members sought review. The court held that such rules and regulations were void and unconstitutional because they did not represent a valid exercise of authorized power. The enabling statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-904B, provided only that the Board was required to adopt rules and regulations for the performance of its duties. Thus, the Arizona Legislature did not confer any power in the Board to prescribe rules and regulations other than those necessary to carry out duties specifically imposed under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-8. Any other interpretation would have indicated an unconstitutional grant of legislative authority. The court reasoned that if the Arizona Legislature had intended to grant the Board power to prescribe rules (within defined limits) regulating professional conduct, then it expressly could have done so.</SPAN></P>

The parents also argued that the juvenile court denied them due process of law by failing to provide proper notice of the charge and the hearing, and failing to notify them of certain constitutional rights. The court affirmed, holding that the Juvenile Code was constitutional. The court also held that there was no right of appeal from a juvenile court order, nor was the general appeal statute,&nbsp;Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-2101, applicable. Further, the court found that the parents were not denied due process of law. The court noted that the parents appeared at both juvenile hearings without objection. The court further noted that the parents knew they could have retained counsel, called witness, and cross-examined the probation officer.

Stat. &sect; 20-741, based on its charging a mortgagor a servicing fee to effect a change in the mortgagor's insurance policy, the Superior Court in Maricopa County (Arizona), pursuant to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 346, certified a question to the court as to whether the charge made by defendant was a charge for payment of an amount for insurance which was prohibited by &sect; 20-471.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought charges against defendant based on the following facts. Defendant was the mortgagee servicing a loan, which covered the mortgagor's home. The mortgagor had secured the home and the mortgage under a fire insurance policy. The mortgagor informed defendant that she intended to change insurance companies. After the mortgagor effectuated the change, defendant examined the new policy and made appropriate revisions on its records. Defendant charged the mortgagor a fee for its services. The State filed an information accusing defendant of violating &sect; 20-741, which made it a misdemeanor for a mortgagee to charge a borrower &quot;for insurance&quot; on the security for a loan other than the insurance premium. Defendant filed a motion to quash the information, arguing &sect; 20-741 was unconstitutionally vague. The court, interpreting &sect; 20-741 to determine the legislature's intent, found that it was unable to discern by the language of the statute what conduct the legislature intended to prohibit. The court concluded that because the phraseology in &sect; 20-741 was so vague and indefinite as to deprive defendant of due process of law, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the trial court's certified question in the negative and ruled that the charges made by defendant for servicing the mortgagor's account were not within the acts prohibited under the applicable statute, which, the court held, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court granted certiorari because the commission had started contempt proceedings, and the state's attorney general had applied for a writ of mandamus. Thus, an appeal as provided by law was not adequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad eliminated certain train services. At the subsequent public hearing, the commission refused to hear the railroad's evidence and ordered the restoration of service. The railroad's request for a rehearing was denied. On certiorari, the court vacated and set aside the commissions' order and held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-367, which prohibited changes affecting service except upon 30 days notice to the commission, applied. However, the court found that state constitution only provided the commission with the general right to supervise and regulate the railroad and that the legislature had not given the commission the right to rearrange the railroad's train service without a judicial determination that the service provided was inadequate. The court concluded that the railroad was entitled to introduce evidence at the hearing to establish that its service was reasonable and adequate and to an impartial determination on the evidence. If the commission found, after a hearing, that the changed service was inadequate, it plainly had the authority to order an intrastate train operated as the public convenience and necessity required.</SPAN></P>

The board denied the doctor's application, but the superior court set aside the order of the board and directed the board to issue the appropriate license. The court affirmed. The court held that the doctor was never found guilty of unprofessional conduct by charges proven by competent evidence after notice and hearing, as required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1452A.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher refused to subscribe to the oath required by the Arizona Communist Control Act of 1961 of all public officers and employees. The teacher filed a class action. The case was before the court for reconsideration on remand. The trial court had entered judgment for appellees, the Board of Trustees and the State. The court affirmed. The Supreme Court of the United States had vacated the judgment and remanded the cause to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court had ruled that such a statute offended if it was open to not one or a few interpretations, but to an indefinite number. The Supreme Court held that only extensive adjudications, under the impact of a variety of factual situations, would bring the oath within the bounds of constitutional certainty. The court held that the portions of the Arizona act considered did not forbid or require conduct in terms so vague that men of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at the meaning and differ as to their application. Since both the act and the aiding referred to in the statute required the specific intent to overthrow the government, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-231(E) was not afflicted with the many uncertainties in advising, teaching, or associations found potentially punishable by the United States Supreme Court. The act did not reach endorsements or support for Communist candidates for office or a lawyer who represented the Communist Party or its members, or journalists who defended the Communist Party or its rights or its members. Such conduct was neither an act nor in aid of an act attempting to overthrow the government by force and violence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that at the time of the commission of the acts charged, &sect; 13-532 did not state any standard or guide from which he could have determined the obscene nature of the material that he was charged with keeping for sale or exhibiting. The court reversed. The court held that it was obvious that a layman would have nothing but difficulty and confusion in his mind were he to attempt to work out his own definitions of the words &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; as used in &sect; 13-532. Indeed, the trial court had considerable difficulty in defining &quot;obscenity&quot; to the jury. The court ruled that &sect; 13-352 was too indefinite and uncertain to permit defendant's conviction to stand.

Reversing the summary judgment, the court determined that the mortgagee had an interest in the realty protected by the Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution and Arizona Constitution that entitled her to actual notice of the land company's intention to apply for a deed so that she could exercise her right of redemption under Ariz.

Appellee argued that the ad valorem taxes should not be credited, pursuant to the statute, and agreed with appellant on the due date. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. The supreme court held that: 1) appellee's interpretation of the statute was contrary to its statutory intent of achieving equality in taxation of insurance companies, 2) statute could not be used to place an additional burden of ad valorem taxes on out-of-state insurance companies, and 3) California due date was applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to quash the information against him on the ground that Ariz.

Defendant further argued that the statements that formed the basis for the charge were not contradictory. The court upheld the trial court's ruling, finding that: (1) although defendant had the burden as to the affirmative defense that at the time he made each of the contradictory statements he believed the statement to be true, the ultimate burden of proof remained with the State; (2) although Ariz.

In his application, the applicant stated that he was not a qualified embalmer. It was conceded that the applicant had been a funeral director for a period of 25 years elsewhere than in Arizona, including the State of California. The applicant contended that Ariz. Rev.

The court held that there was a reasonable basis which justified the legislature in requiring that a funeral director have not less than one year's experience as a qualified practicing embalmer associated with a qualified practicing funeral director.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-611. Defendant was sentenced to a term of 7 to 15 years in the Arizona State Prison, pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-614.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's victim was 13 years old; defendant was 19. He was convicted of statutory rape. Defendant committed the crime before the effective date of an amendment to Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-611, 13-614, but he entered his guilty plea and was sentenced after the effective date of the amendment. Defendant was charged and sentenced under the unamended statutes. The amendment, which was made pursuant to 1965 Ariz. Sess. Laws 159, ch. 52, essentially set apart statutory rape from the other five classifications of rape so as to allow a different penalty to be assessed for statutory rape. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that the amendment repealed Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-611 as it pertained to statutory rape. The amendment merely set that crime apart from other forms of rape and did not change the crime from a felony to a misdemeanor. The court also ruled that the amendment did not repeal by implication the penalty provision of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-614, the amendment did not violate the ex post facto clauses of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect;25, and the sentence imposed did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under Ariz. Const. art. 2. &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>

He suffered various injuries to his back. He returned to light duty work even though he continued to suffer from intermittent pain. The Commission found that his physical condition had become stationary and that his average monthly wage prior to the injury was $ 331. The Commission made the wage determination based upon a memorandum from his various employers for 312 days preceding the injury. The claimant initiated an action challenging the Commission's findings. In setting aside the award, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the Commission's computation of average monthly wage. There was no evidence in the record to support the memorandum's facts, and the claimant had no chance to rebut the information. The court found that the Commission did not correctly compute the claimant's average monthly wage because the 30 days prior to the injury was the basic wage for computing compensation under Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the licensees had accumulated 12 points within 12 months against their driving record under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-446, subs. A, para. 3 (as amended), the state ordered the suspension of their driver's licenses. The licensees brought an action challenging the suspension, and the trial court issued a permanent injunction enjoining the suspensions on the ground that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-446, subs. A, para. 3 was an unconstitutional delegation of power. The state sought review. On appeal, the court held that the criteria established by the legislature for the suspension of a driver's license under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-446 was reasonably definite and involving a minimum of discretion, particularly where it was obviously impractical to lay down an exact comprehensive rule. The court held that the contingency under which &sect; 28-446 operated was that the licensees had shown disrespect for traffic laws and disregard for the safety of others. The court reversed the trial court's order and dissolved the injunction against the state on the ground that the legislature was entitled to make the application of &sect; 28-446 dependent upon the existence or occurrence of certain conditions.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Industrial Commission of Arizona found that there was no evidence of new, additional, or previously undiscovered disability, that all prior awards were res judicata, and ordered the reinstatement of partial permanent disability compensation. The employee sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In making its decision to reinstate partial permanent disability payments, the Commission concluded that since there was no subsequent change in the employee's physical condition affecting his earning capacity, it did not have the authority to readjust the amount that represented the employee's reduced monthly earnings. Under Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8, the percentages and amounts of compensation provided in H.B. 227, 7th Leg. (Ariz. 1925), should never be reduced, except by initiated or referred measure. However, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-1044F required that when the physical condition of an injured employee became stationary, the Commission should determine the amount that represented his reduced earning capacity and permit a change if there had been a change in the injured employee's physical condition. The court held that &sect; 23-1044F conflicted with Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 8 and was unconstitutional and void. Therefore, the court held that the Commission was required to reconsider the case as one where there was a showing of a reduction in earning capacity, although there was no change in the employee's physical condition.</SPAN></P>

In her original petition to the court for certiorari, the nursery owner argued that the act under which the Board acted violated Ariz. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, the due process clause. The court agreed and held that Ariz. Rev. Stat. 8-601 et seq., was unconstitutional. The act did not provide for a hearing to determine whether the Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying the application for a license. Nor was the nursery owner given a remedy by judicial review because Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-902 specifically excepted from review the decision of the State Department of Public Welfare.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public employee claimed that an oath that she was required to take as a condition of employment, which pledged loyalty to the government, and promised to refrain from certain conduct, deprived her of her constitutional rights. The oath was codified at Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-231. The lower court found the language of the oath to be constitutional. The court agreed and affirmed. The court held that the language of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-231(E) had no relationship to beliefs. It prohibited any membership in any organization seeking to overthrow the government. It made criminal after the taking and subscription to the oath all memberships in all organizations engaging in illegal advocacy. The court concluded that prohibited conduct in denying membership in certain organizations diminished the individual's freedom of association and hence the unfettered communication of ideas, but that constitutional restraints were satisfied. The conduct sacrificed to governmental interests only minimally and incidentally conflicted with the First Amendment. The gravity of the evil sought to be reached, discounted by its improbability, justified the invasion.</SPAN></P>

The writ was granted after the denial of petitioner City of Tempe's motion to dismiss the convicted individual's appeal for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convicted individual paid his fine for the conviction of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and then filed a timely notice of appeal. The City filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction on the grounds that the convicted individual had not posted a bond on appeal and had satisfied the sentence imposed by the municipal court. The amici curiae asserted that Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-372 as construed might have been unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) since &sect; 22-372 provided only for the filing of a bond if the superior court desired the execution of sentence to be stayed, &sect; 22-372 did not affect the manner of appeal; (2) the bond provided for by &sect; 22-372 was not a prerequisite to a convicted individual's right to appeal but only to the stay of execution of sentence pending the disposition of the appeal; (3) although the convicted individual had satisfied the sentence imposed upon him, he was still allowed to appeal to the superior court and receive a trial de novo; and (4) the right to an appeal in all criminal cases as guaranteed by Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 24 applied even when the sentence imposed by the municipal court had been satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the alternative writ of prohibition previously made peremptory to the end that there could be further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner challenged the trial court's decision in favor of the city permitting the city to condemn a portion of the property's owner's lot. The court held that the municipal ordinances, upon which basis the city instituted the condemnation proceeding, were a reasonable exercise of the city's police power and that the trial jury was properly instructed concerning the ordinances. The ordinances sought to avoid the danger of collisions with vehicles or pedestrians created by automobiles backing into traffic from off-street parking places. The elimination of that danger was a legitimate consequence of the city's right and duty to regulate traffic for the benefit of the public's safety and general welfare. The consequent elimination of two of the property owner's parking spaces was not an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of power in view of the public interest involved. Further, the property owner did not have an inherent or vested right in the continued manner of parking automobiles to which he had become accustomed. Accordingly, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver and owner were involved in an car accident and neither had liability insurance. The superintendent determined that security should be posted in order to avoid the license and registration suspension provisions of &sect; 28-1142. They argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the due process and equal protection clauses was an unlawful delegation of legislative and judicial authority. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because the distinction made in &sect; 28-1142 between uninsured motorist who had been involved in accidents and those who had not was reasonable and the statute provided for an administrative hearing that, if requested, had to be held prior to the effective date of an order of suspension. There was not an unconstitutional delegation of power because the statute contained definite standards which governed the exercise of power and provided for a judicial review. The court declined to reaffirm its holding in Goodwin v.

On appeal, the court held that: (1) defendant's argument relating to the credibility of the State's witnesses went to the weight of the evidence rather than to its sufficiency and could not be properly considered on appeal; (2) a further continuance of the time of sentencing was properly denied because the trial judge had determined that no further investigation was necessary after considering a statement by the third person that he did not commit the crime but was persuaded by defendant to confess thereto; and (3) it was too late to disqualify the trial judge once he was allowed to receive evidence, which was to be used and weighed in deciding the ultimate issues.</SPAN></P>

The register posted the notice of the application as required in the registrar's rules. When the registrar received a complaint that the applicant had done work prior to the issuance of his license, the registrar held a hearing. The registrar did not reach a decision, so the applicant filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the registrar to issue the license. The registrar held a second hearing, and 60 days after the application was filed, the registrar denied the license. The trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandamus, but a stay was granted pending the registrar's appeal. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and directed the trial court to quash the peremptory writ. The court held that the applicant had an adequate, plain, and speedy remedy at law under the Act, so the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the writ. There was nothing unconstitutional in the registrar's rules and in allowing the registrar to determine whether the posting period was sufficient, if the posting procedure need be followed at all, and if a hearing on the application was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners petitioned the board of supervisors to organize an electrical district with regard to certain land. The requirements for approval were found at Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-505(A) (1956). After a denial of the petition, the landowners appealed to the trial court, which reversed the denial. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, but, on a motion for a rehearing, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. One contention of the board was that the requirement of arid land was not met because the land in question was being cultivated. The court did not agree. The court ruled that the terms arid and reclaimable as used in &sect; 30-505(A) had to be read as referring to the very nature of the land unchanged by subsequent irrigation and cultivation. There was evidence that the land at issue had an annual rainfall of less than nine inches and was insufficient to support agriculture. Arid portions of the state meant those portions where rainfall was insufficient for agricultural purposes and irrigation was therefore required.</SPAN></P>

Incidental to the district's purpose to provide water for irrigation, the district provided electricity to residents outside the city's corporate limits. A dispute arose when the city annexed territory that the district served. The city brought a declaratory judgment action against the district to determine the parties' rights to service the residents in the disputed areas. The district filed a counterclaim to restrain the city from competing or interfering with its services. The trial court ruled in favor of the district. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part and held that the district had a property interest in the areas it served and that the city was not permitted to oust the district from doing business in the disputed areas without just compensation. The court determined that both parties were engaged in proprietary functions and that competition between the two in the disputed areas was prohibited by Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-516(A).

He also claimed that the information charged disjunctive allegations requiring different grades and qualities of proof, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-621(B) created an improper presumption that the property was stolen and that he had knowledge that it was stolen, the cousin's testimony was inadmissible because he was an accessory, and the jury should have been permitted to find him guilty of a misdemeanor. The court found no reversible error because (1) the information sufficiently listed the trade names of the items and whether they were men's or ladies' watches, (2) Ariz. R. Crim. P. 138 permitted disjunctive charges, (3) the presumption created by Ariz. Rev.

The trial court granted defendant's motion to quash on the ground that &sect; 13-532 was unconstitutional. The State appealed. On review, the court noted that if &sect; 13-532 lacked a scienter requirement then it would be unconstitutional. The court noted that the problem was how to construe &sect; 13-532 when it did not require scienter on its face. The court found that the construction of state law was the exclusive responsibility of the state courts. The court held that &sect; 13-532 required proof of guilty knowledge or scienter. The court determined that statutes should be construed as constitutional whenever possible. In addition, the court followed the majority of courts and stated that &sect; 13-532 impliedly required scienter. The court reasoned that &sect; 13-532 had to be read as if prefaced by &quot;whoever wilfully and knowingly&quot;; and that &quot;knowingly&quot; meant with knowledge of the obscene nature of the materials involved.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and charged with first-degree burglary. A preliminary hearing was held, where a witness testified for the State. He was extensively cross-examined by counsel for defendant. At the trial, the witness could not be secured to testify in person. In lieu of his presence, and pursuant to Ariz. R. Crim. P. 30(B), the duly reported and certified transcript of his testimony at the preliminary hearing was admitted into evidence over defendant's objection. As a foundation for admission of that evidence, 14 subpoenas from all counties in the state and one out-of-state subpoena were introduced into evidence. In addition, a deputy sheriff testified as to the unavailability of the witness. Defendant contended that he had a constitutional right to be confronted face to face with the witnesses against him. The court found that the reproduction of testimony taken at a former trial or in the presence of an accused at a preliminary hearing, when the presence of the witness could not be secured, did not contravene the constitutional right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the trial court's decision, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1103(D), (E) was held to be invalid, in that it attempted to transfer to the legislative branch a function, auditing claims against the State of Arizona, that was constitutionally delegated to the executive branch of the government. The taxpayer argued that the unconstitutional statute was a nullity; therefore, the payments received thereunder by the legislators were &quot;illegal&quot; and subject to return. The court, however, held that the law did not penalize a citizen who obeyed a law later determined to be unconstitutional. Citizens, even legislators, were entitled to rely upon an enactment of the legislature until repealed or declared unconstitutional. The court further noted that the good or bad faith of the legislators in voting to enact the statute exempting themselves from Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35-181 could not be inquired into by the court or any other court in Arizona. That power was reposed in the voters alone. Accordingly, the second count of the complaint, which alleged illegal payment to the legislators in light of the unconstitutional statute, failed to state a cause of action and was subject to dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, water company and its owners (water company), sought a writ of prohibition against respondents, superior court, judge, and city, to prevent the superior court from issuing an order allowing the city to take immediate possession of the water company's property in the city's eminent domain proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After voters approved a proposition where the city was permitted to acquire the property of utility companies through eminent domain, the city began eminent domain proceedings against the water company. The city applied for immediate possession under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1116. The superior court granted the application. The water company sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the city from taking immediate possession of the property. The court issued an alternative writ of prohibition. The court quashed the alternative writ, holding that &sect; 12-1116 did not violate Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17, which entitles a property owner to just compensation in an eminent domain proceeding. The court found that the general statute governing immediate possession in eminent domain cases in &sect; 12-1116 applied to the water company since none of the special statutes, including Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-518, dealt with the subject of immediate possession or specifically excluded the application of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1116. The court also determined that findings under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-1112 were not necessary where the city complied with the Municipal Bond Article, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9-521 to 9-540.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the father were divorced, and the mother was given custody of the parties' minor child. The father subsequently petitioned for a change in custody, alleging that the child was not receiving proper care, teaching, and education. The mother was a Jehovah's Witness and had instructed her son not to salute the flag or to participate in school activities where allegiance was pledged. Based on this information, the trial court amended the decree to award custody to the father. The court held that the mother could not be deprived of the custody of the child merely based on her religious beliefs. Because it appeared that the mother's affiliation with the Jehovah's witnesses was the basis for the custody modification, the court found that it was an abuse of discretion and required reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted the ordinance to make classifications designed to harmonize a primarily residential area with its master plan while at the same time conforming as nearly as possible to the existing use of the area. The ordinance gave the properties a residential zoning classification that permitted the broadest range of uses, including ordinary residential uses, office buildings, theaters, hotels, and motels. The property owners challenged the ordinance, seeking a commercial zoning classification. The lower court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the maps in evidence showed that the zoning of the properties in dispute was fully consistent with the patterns established throughout an infinitely larger area of the city. The property owners failed to show that the ordinance was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable and that it had no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. Their offer of proof that their properties would be more valuable under commercial zoning was not sufficient for the court to say that it the ordinance was confiscatory and thus a taking without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the trial court had erred when it refused to admit an ordinance into evidence. The ordinance provided that the city would not have been liable for the injuries. The court held that there was no authority for the ordinance in the city charter or in the statutes or constitution and therefore the ordinance was invalid and there was no error committed by the exclusion of the ordinance. The city further argued that the injured individual and her husband had failed to prove that a defect actually existed of such a nature as to have imposed on the city a duty to repair the defect. The court determined that it was reasonable that the jury found a defect from the evidence presented. The city also contended that it did not have any notice of the defect. However, there was sufficient competent evidence regarding the receipt of actual notice by the city's police department the same day as the injured individual's accident. Because there was sufficient evidence to submit the case to the jury and the jury's verdict was reasonable, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The alternative writ did not include any of the complaint's recitations, and it was issued summarily the same day as the petition for a writ of mandamus. The court ordered respondents to cease and desist from further proceedings to enforce the amended peremptory writ of mandamus. Under both the common law rule and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-2021 through 12-2029, the alternative writ was the primary pleading. The alternative writ was properly dismissed because it did not contain any allegations and, therefore, did not state a claim. Because the alternative writ was void, it could not be the foundation for the peremptory writ of mandamus. Therefore, the peremptory writ was void and should have been quashed. A writ of prohibition was proper because appeal was inadequate remedy where a court threatened to enforce a void amended peremptory writ of mandamus by possible contempt proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the sentence. The court noted that the sentence was within the limits of the applicable statute and enumerated several of the factors that were considered by the trial court. The trial court was permitted to consider not only the circumstances of the offense charged but also the moral character and past conduct of defendant in order to grade the punishment in accordance with the general character of both the offense and defendant. The court added that there was no requirement that a trial court give defendant, a first offender, a minimum sentence. The court rejected defendant's argument that the sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated his constitutional rights. The court found that the penalty provision of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 36-1020, did not violate due process and was not a violation of equal protection of the laws. Because the Act was not unconstitutional, a sentence within the limits prescribed by such statute would not be regarded as cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the superior court's order reversing the Board's decision, directed the superior court to enter judgment for the Board, and found that the superior court erred by finding that the land in question was reclaimable for purposes of &sect; 30-505(A)(2). The land in question was fertile arid desert land, which already had been brought under cultivation, was producing agricultural crops as a result of an irrigation system, and had been reclaimed from its natural state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the landowners' motion for summary judgment in the state's condemnation action. The state appealed, arguing that the summary judgment, in effect, ruled unconstitutional certain provisions of Ariz. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 18-155(D) for the first time. The court held that the interference with private property rights prescribed by &sect; 18-155(D) was neither an appropriate nor justifiable means for exercising the state's police power. The deprivation and depreciation of the landowner's rights caused by &sect; 18-155(D), without payment of compensation, violated Ariz.

The court ruled that the state was not able to have two years to decide whether to take the landowners' property for highways, two years to change its mind or pay. The court held that Ariz. Rev.

Upon appeal, the superior court found him guilty, and defendant once again appealed, contending that &sect; 16-862 was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that &sect; 16-862 was constitutional. The court held that there was no basis whatsoever for the assertion that &sect; 16-862 delegated any legislative power to anyone. The language was clear. It was not a delegation of power to anyone. It was merely a direction to the election marshal to post the three notices approximately 50 feet in different directions from the entrance of the place in which the election was being held. The court further held that the legislature in using such language intended to designate the entrance to the building as the point from which the measurement should have been taken in establishing the locations at which the &quot;50-foot limit&quot; notices were to be posted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the issues raised were whether the order of the board, which issued pursuant to a hearing in which the teacher was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses appearing against her, denied to her due process of the law and whether certiorari to the court was the proper remedy. The court found that the president of the board repeatedly denied the demands of the teacher's attorney to cross-examine witnesses who testified against the teacher. Thus, the court held that the legislature intended that a teacher appearing before a board be allowed to cross-examine his or her accusing witnesses. It was concluded that the refusal of the board to permit counsel for the teacher to cross-examine a witness violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 4. Further, the court found that the Arizona Teacher Tenure Act was valid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation brought an action urging that it had the same primary right to bring an action that the Commission possessed. The court determined that a premium for basic costs was included within the operation of the self-rating plan at issue. It having been admitted that the premium was paid, the court held that it became apparent that no claim for relief in restitution existed. The corporation moved for a rehearing, urging that the court's construction of the self-rating endorsement and the self-rating plan permitted a totally unbridled discretion to charge or not to charge for basic costs and destroyed the constitutionality of the Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-983(E). The court held that the corporation, who had invoked the provision of a statute, sought to avail itself of its terms, and had been an actor thereunder, could not thereafter question its constitutionality. Moreover, the Commission did not have unbridled discretion to charge or not to charge at will for basic costs. It should have provided for a rate to meet the specified items and, hence, was manifestly prohibited from establishing a rate that would not meet the basic costs of the self-raters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general had alleged that the contemplated sale was in violation of the Arizona Constitution. The department claimed that the attorney general lacked standing to institute the suit on behalf of the state. The court made peremptory the alternative writ of prohibition heretofore issued. Under Ariz. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 the attorney general's powers derived from statutory law. Nothing in the relevant statutes supported the attorney general's standing to institute the present action. The position of the attorney general was in direct conflict with an official determination, respecting the sale of the public lands in issue, made by the department, which was vested by statute with full authority over the lands. Nothing in the record indicated that the attorney general was acting on behalf of any other state agency, which was empowered to maintain a position contrary to that taken by the department. Further, the attorney general did not seek review by the court of a judicial proceeding in which a proper state official had been made a party, but rather initiated an original action on his own relation in the superior court.</SPAN></P>

The state motor vehicle division and automobile dealers association argued that the requirement was necessary to ensure the permanency and stability of the new car business. The court concluded that the requirement for a building with display room was unreasonable, discriminatory, and violated equal protection clauses of Ariz. Const. art.

In addition, the court determined that Arizona Highway Department, Division of Motor Vehicles Rules 16 and 17, which required that dealers of new cars show enfranchisement by the manufacturer to obtain certificates of titles, exceeded the scope of their statutory basis.</SPAN></P>

First, was the provision unconstitutional as being a delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency? The court answered the question in the negative. The court held that the circumstances to control crop pests and disease varied from pest to pest and disease to disease. Therefore, it was impossible for the legislature to designate a precise role of conduct. The second certified question was as follows: Was the &quot;Notice of Adoption of Rules&quot; filed in the office of the Secretary of State invalid as being signed only by the State Entomologist? The third question was as follows: Was the regulation in question invalid in that there was no certified copy of the rule adopted on file with the Secretary of State?

The producers alleged that the statute violated the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ariz. Const. art. 2, &sect; 4. The court agreed.

The commission was allowed to institute a self-rating plan. This allowed the commission to modify tentative rates of premiums in accordance with loss experience of the insured. Appellant contended that the commission could not subject the rate of premium for basic costs to the plan. The court affirmed. The commission agreed that the rate of premium for primary losses would be modified on a 100 percent self-rating basis subject to the self-rating plan. By promising this it did not promise anything regarding the computation of the rates for premiums for basic costs. The legislature did not intend to give the commission the right to impose a tax on self-raters. This would be an unconstitutional delegation of authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction resulted from his active encouragement of a 17-year-old girl to allow motion pictures to be taken of her in the nude. Defendant sought reversal of his conviction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to show any conduct on his part that violated &sect; 13-822. Defendant also argued that his conviction was void because &sect; 13-822 was unconstitutional for failing to establish a standard of guilt and prescribe the prohibited conduct. The court upheld defendant's conviction. Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-821C and 13-822 prohibited the encouragement of any act that tended to debase or injure the morals, health, or welfare of a child. The evidence showed that defendant participated directly in encouraging the commission of the acts in question, which was all that &sect; 13-822 required. Further, the statutes at issue, which prohibited only the causing or encouraging of acts that injured the morals, health, or welfare of a child, did not violate either the Arizona Constitution or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state, county, and school district, appealed an order of a trial court of Maricopa County (Arizona), which entered judgment for plaintiff insurer in its action for a declaratory judgment that a fire insurance policy issued to the school district was valid. The trial court also found for the insurer in the county's counter-claim against the insurer and cross-defendants, other insurers, for a declaration that the policies were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants refused to pay the premium due and alleged that a contract with a mutual insurance company was prohibited by Ariz. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 and that, accordingly, the statute authorizing such a contract, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20-715(B), was invalid. The trial court found that the insurance of public property in Arizona under nonassessable policies or contracts of insurance by mutual fire insurance companies was authorized by statute and did not offend the Arizona Constitution. On appeal, defendants contended that until an insurer paid the school district dividends, the premiums paid amounted to a forbidden loan from the school district to the insurer. The court disagreed and affirmed. There was no requirement that dividends had to be paid and the premium was only consideration for the insurance based on its estimated cost. The court rejected defendants' claim that buying insurance from a mutual company was forbidden because of the constitutional prohibition against becoming a shareholder or joint owner in any company. Unlike a shareholder or a joint owner, a member of a mutual insurance company had no ownership interest which in itself was transferable to another.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the insurer in its action against the state, county, and school district for a declaratory judgment that a fire insurance policy issued to the school district was valid. The court also affirmed the judgment in favor of all of the insurers in the county's counter-claim for a declaration that the policies were invalid.</SPAN></P>

Defendants and intervenor-defendants appealed, raising numerous issues. The court affirmed the judgment below, ruling that under the Declaratory Judgment Act, &sect; 12-1841, the interests of those not made parties was not affected and their rights were not prejudiced. Therefore, those persons that did not intervene were not necessary parties. The court also ruled that under &sect; 3-401, the term commercial production meant that the crop was then in being or was about to come into being, sufficient in quantity and quality for commercial disposition. The definitiions applied by the trial court were correct. The court further ruled in part that the prorate commissioner was in a position to determine who were legal voters in balloting as provided for by &sect; 3-410. He had to perform the ministerial duty of removing all persons from the list who were not producers and who did not own or control producing factors. Thus mandamus was properly invoked.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff policeman brought an action against defendant Police Pension Board in the trial court (Arizona) for a declaratory judgment that the 1952 amendment, Ariz. Sess. Laws 93 (1952), to the Police Pension Act of 1937, Ariz. Sess. Laws 40 (1937), was unconstitutional as applied to the policeman and others hired before the effective date of the amendment. The trial court granted the Board's summary judgment motion. The policeman appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the effective date of the 1952 amendment, Ariz. Sess. Laws 93 (1952), a policeman's pension was calculated as 50 percent of the policeman's average monthly compensation over the five years immediately preceding the date of the application for retirement. Prior to the amendment, the policeman was to receive 50 percent of the average monthly compensation received in the year immediately preceding retirement. Under the amendment, the policeman's pension was $ 23 per month less than he would have received prior to the amendment. The policeman alleged that he had a vested right to have his pension calculated pursuant to the statute in effect on his employment commencement date. The court upheld the constitutionality of the 1952 amendment as applied to the policeman. The court held that, although the policeman had a right to a reasonable pension, the pension law in effect at the time he entered public service was not part of his employment contract. The policeman did not have a vested right to benefits under a particular law that could not be altered by a subsequent act of the Arizona legislature.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that the accident occurred when the truck's glaring lights blinded her husband, causing him to brake his vehicle and skid into the path of the oncoming truck. Defendants argued that the husband's own negligence in driving was the sole and proximate, or contributory, cause of the accident. The trial court found for defendants, but the court reversed and ordered a new trial. The court sustained plaintiff's objections to the jury instructions, holding that the instructions were erroneous and fundamentally prejudiced the verdict. The court found that a jury instruction that stated the husband was negligent as a matter of law if he observed the glaring lights but continued to drive at a speed which prevented his stopping within an assured clear distance ahead was improper. Instead, the court held that the proper test was what would an ordinarily prudent person have done under the circumstances as they then appeared to exist. The court also held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury to impute the father's negligence to the son.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the legislature did not express an intention to include birds or fowls within the purview of &sect; 13-951. The court was unable to find from the words, context, subject matter, spirit or purpose of &sect; 13-951 a clear indication of an intent to include a gamecock in the category of animals, or to make it a crime for a person to conduct a cockfight wherein such gamecocks were subjected to needless suffering. To interpret &sect; 13-951 in accordance with the contentions of the state would have rendered it vague, indefinite, and uncertain and therefore in violation of due process. The court was unwilling to say that &sect; 13-951 was sufficiently clear and definite to give notice to the ordinary man that the statute subjected him to prosecution if he engaged in conducting a cockfight wherein needless suffering was inflicted upon a gamecock.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner was charged with first degree murder. The prisoner brought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking his release from custody on the grounds that he was placed in jeopardy under the proceedings for second degree murder, and therefore could not be held on a subsequent charge of first degree murder, which constituted double jeopardy. The trial court denied the petition and the prisoner appealed. The court ruled that a defendant was in jeopardy after a jury was selected and sworn.

The employee brought an action to compel payment of benefits under the old law.

The trial court granted the Board's motion a to the former, but denied it as to the latter. The board appealed the denial. The court found that the employee was not entitled to benefits while employed by another public entity because there was a rational basis for the change made by the legislature in the pension laws and the employee's substantial and material rights were not effected by the change.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On petition by intervenor-appellee city, appellee Corporation Commission entered an order directing appellant railroad to install at its sole expense two electrically operated flashing warning signals at one of its crossings. The railroad sought judicial review of the commission's order under the provisions of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-254, and the trial court (Arizona) affirmed the commission's order. The railroad appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the railroad argued that the crossing did not create a hazardous condition dangerous to public health and safety, that any hazard at the crossing did not result from acts of the railroad, that the commission failed to apportion the cost of the protective devices under an applicable statute, and that an interpretation of governing statutes that placed the entire cost of crossing protection on the railroad made them unconstitutional. The appellate court rejected these contentions. The evidence revealed that thousands of vehicles passed over the crossing each day, that there were approximately 56 train movements over the crossing each day, and that certain buildings limited drivers' sight distance along the railroad tracks. Hence, substantial evidence justified the determination that the crossing was hazardous and that the public health and safety required the protective devices. Moreover, the court had previously held that an interpretation of the statutes which imposed the entire cost of signaling devices on the railroad did not render them unconstitutional. Finally, it was immaterial that the buildings that limited drivers' sight were not railroad buildings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first certified question asked whether fraud or misrepresentation was an essential element under &sect; 32-145. The court held that by the very wording of the Act, fraud or misrepresentation were not made essential elements. The second certified question asked whether &sect; 32-145 was unconstitutional because it was vague, indefinite, and uncertain. The court determined that the definitions in the statute were sufficient. The third question asked whether a citizen who was not a registrant under the Act was subject to prosecution if he had not represented himself to be a registrant and had designed a structure but did not represent that the structure was safe. The court decided that the individual was practicing as an architect and had to be registered. The fourth and fifth questions were paraphrased into whether the Act too broadly and unjustly purported to exercise the State's police power to be constitutional. The court concluded that there was no discriminatory favoritism or monopoly created by the Act. Finally, the sixth question asked was whether the Act constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court answered that question in the negative.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-101 et seq. Prior to the hearing, the engineer sought a writ of prohibition on grounds including that the charges against him were insufficient to establish that the board was acting within its jurisdiction. The trial court granted the writ of prohibition. The board appealed. The court held that two of the charges brought against the engineer by the board did not constitute charges legally sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the board upon which to predicate a formal disciplinary hearing under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-128(B). However, the court ruled that the licensing statute, although difficult to interpret, was valid because it was definite enough to serve as a guide to those upon whom it imposed a duty. The court found that the third charge was a valid one and that therefore the trial court erred in prohibiting a hearing thereon. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was reversed with instructions to quash its writ of prohibition and to dismiss the engineer's petition.</SPAN></P>

Both parties had fair trade agreements with certain producers covering the same products, and the corporation had agreements with two additional producers. The retailer admittedly violated all of the fair trade agreements and refused the corporation's demands to desist.

The trial court also dismissed the corporation's complaint in all other respects and held the Arizona Fair Trade Act, Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-1421 to &sect; 44-1424, unconstitutional. Bot parties appealed. The court reversed because the retailer admitted that he had knowledge of the restrictions imposed by the producer in its fair trade agreement with the corporation and that he willfully violated the agreement by offering for sale or selling the drugs at a price below the fair trade price. Therefore, the retailer was bound by the fair trade agreement even though he was a non-signer. In addition, the statute had already been upheld as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the same day the employer filed a complaint to restrain defendants from picketing the construction site, an ex parte order was entered granting the injunction.

The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that the trial court relied upon Ariz. Rev.

The court found that no dispute existed between the employer and its employees or between the subcontractors and their employees. The court also noted that none of the employer's employees were members of the union and that none had requested to become members.

Appraisers were appointed and rendered a report to the effect that the landowners would be damaged in a certain sum for moving certain improvements. The report contained no estimation of the value of the property taken. The Board subsequently adopted a resolution awarding the landowners the certain sum for property taken and payment for damages and providing for the establishment of the road which included a strip off the landowners property. The landowners did not accept the award and sued for just compensation. The trial court awarded the landowners an amount as compensation for the property taken and a sum in severance damages. The court held that the landowners were not bound by the action of the Board in awarding them a sum, notwithstanding the fact that they did not avail themselves of the provisions of &sect;&sect; 18-201 to -205. The court further held that the landowners were entitled to a trial by jury to determine the amount of just compensation due them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission found that a hazardous condition existed at a railroad crossing and that it was necessary to install two warning signals. The Commission entered an order directing the company to install the devices at its sole expense. The company brought an action seeking to set aside the order, contending that the hazardous condition no longer existed and that the hazard created at the time of establishing the crossing was not sufficient to justify the imposition on the company of the entire cost of the signals. The county was allowed to intervene, and the trial court granted appellees' motions to dismiss, finding that the company was bound by a prior judgment in another case and that the case was res judicata as to the issues presented in this case. The court reversed. The court held that res judicata did not bar the company's issues; a different order was rendered by the Commission in the present case, and the company questioned the order on different grounds that did not exist in the first action. The court held further that, under Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-336, under certain conditions it was reasonable to require the company to pay all of the cost of the warning signals.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's motion to dismiss and entered judgment in favor of appellee holding ch. 119 unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that appellee's suit for a declaratory judgment pursuant to Ariz. Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of appellees. The property owners contended that the petition seeking annexation was not signed by the owners of 50 percent of the property valuation subject to taxation in the event the territory was annexed. The court found that two properties were improperly included, but that the remaining aggregate value exceeded the needed valuation. Although that portion of Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59-601 which empowered the board of supervisors to assess damages and award compensation was invalid, the remainder of &sect;59-601 was valid and enforceable. Thus, the board's action in setting the boundary of the territory was proper and the annexation ordinance did not encompass more territory than that set forth in the petition. The fact that the city's annexation petition was not the first filed did not deny the city of jurisdiction. The city acquired jurisdiction first because it was the first to present its petition to its council for action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of a trial court (Arizona), which entered a judgment of conviction against him after a jury found him guilty of kidnapping, a violation of 1935 Ariz.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary question on appeal was whether a defendant who allegedly took or detained a person for any purpose other than for pecuniary gain could be lawfully charged or convicted of kidnapping under ch. 13, &sect; 1. Defendant's principal contention was that one who allegedly took or detained a person for any purpose other than for pecuniary gain could not be charged or convicted of the crime stated in ch. 13, &sect; 1. The court noted the fact that the Arizona statute was modeled after the federal statutes and Arizona was the only state that had a similar statute. The court held that while federal decisions interpreting the similar federal statute were not binding, they were necessarily entitled to great weight. The court determined that the charge was properly laid under the statute and the conviction was valid. Defendant also challenged his sentence but the court concluded that there was nothing in the nature of a fundamental right attributed to parole and the legislature could limit or deny parole altogether. The punishment was approximately proportionate to the crime and there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

The issues were whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-1103(D), (E) infringed upon an executive department, preventing the auditor from determining whether the claims were proper under Ariz. Const. art. IV, part 2, &sect;&sect; 1, 17 and whether mandamus lay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 41-141 implemented Ariz. Const. art. III, art. V, &sect; 1, and art. V, &sect; 9 and Ariz. Rev. Stat. &sect; 35-181 supplemented &sect; 41-141. The court held that the creation of the constitutional office of auditor contemplated that someone should audit claims against the state, and, under &sect; 41-141, the state auditor had that duty unless it was expressly given to another. Auditing was an executive function, and the framers of the Arizona Constitution intended that the auditing of public officials' accounts would be performed by an officer independent of those officials. Section 41-1103(D), (E) violated the concept of an independent auditor. The power to audit the expense claims of the members of the legislative branch was delegated by the Constitution to the Executive Branch and impliedly placed in the hands of the state auditor. Therefore, &sect; 41-1103(D), (E) was unconstitutional and void. Mandamus would not lie, because the auditor had discretion in auditing petitioners' claims to determine whether they were excessive in amount and, therefore, inconsistent with Ariz. Const. art. IV, pt. 2, &sect; 17 prohibiting extra compensation. The court quashed the alternative writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff heirs sought review of a judgment from the trial court (Arizona), which found for defendants, railroad and employees, in a negligence action that was brought after the decedent was killed in a railroad crossing accident. In seeking review, the heirs claimed a jury instruction had violated Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 5 by usurping the jury's function of finding contributory negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heirs brought a negligence action following the decedent's death in a railroad crossing accident, and in instructing the jury, the trial court mandated a finding of contributory negligence if a failure to exercise proper vigilance or a failure to yield the right-of-way was found. Following a judgment for defendants, the heirs sought review, and the court reversed. Because the question of contributory negligence had been a question of fact for the jury alone, pursuant to Ariz. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 5, the court held the trial court had committed reversible error by instructing that certain facts, which had contributed to the accident, had constituted contributory negligence. However, the court upheld the trial court's instruction that the train's failure to operate on schedule had not constituted negligence because the train's absence from the track had not been assumable. Moreover, the court held an engineer's statement regarding the hazards of the railroad crossing had been admissible as defendants' admission, notwithstanding the opinion rule.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the contractor and surety had admitted in their answer that the bond was executed pursuant to the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation filed suit against defendant state land commissioner to determine the corporation's rights to the use of subterranean waters underlying its lands. The superior court (Arizona) determined that the Groundwater Code, 1948 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 5, was constitutional, but that the Act of 1953, 1953 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 42, &sect;&sect; 2-5, were invalid and unconstitutional. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation urged that the Groundwater Code, 1948 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 5, denied to the corporation the equal protection of the laws in that the statute permitted unrestricted and unregulated water pumping by landowners in non-critical areas and denied the same right to landowners in critical areas, that the statute was void for vagueness, and that the commissioner was granted illegal powers. The court held that if a law provided a defined course of conduct upon the occurrence or determination of an occurrence of a particular condition or state of facts, even though that determination was dependent on an evaluation in the nature of a deduction from facts, there was neither an unconstitutional delegation of power nor was such a statute so indefinite as to be invalid. It was not necessary to lay down in advance an exact mathematical formula for a designated administrative agency to adhere to, for often circumstances varied. There was no uncertainty as to the commissioner's principal duties under the Groundwater Code, 1948 Ariz. Sess. Laws &sect;&sect; 5(a), 6(a), in what end result was to be achieved, or what administrative steps would be followed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants levied an assessment on the gross receipts of the sales of the corporate taxpayer pursuant to Ariz.

The trial court granted judgment in favor of the corporate taxpayer. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that the corporate taxpayer was the entity that was required to pay the tax, and not the United States government because the tax was levied upon the entity doing business and not upon the transactions. Therefore, the court concluded that the tax did not violate the United State government's immunity from state taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting upon the authority of Ariz. Code Ann. &sect; 19-301 (1955), the Governor of Arizona appointed the purported judge to the office of superior court judge. The Attorney General sought ouster. Upon consideration, the court ruled in favor of the Attorney General and ordered that the purported judge by ousted and excluded from office. The clause of &sect; 19-301 which read &quot;for the purpose of this act, the counties of Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, and Yuma are hereby declared to have, and shall be held to have, inhabitants respectively, in excess of 460,000, 205,000, 55,000, and 45,000&quot; was unconstitutional and void. Because the purported judge was appointed by virtue of that clause, he was guilty of intruding into and usurping the office of judge. These words &quot;a census enumeration&quot; as found in Ariz. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5 were words of limitation, and thus the legislature was precluded from substituting for &quot;a census enumeration&quot; a declaration that the counties of Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, and Yuma had a population in excess of certain named amounts. &quot;A census enumeration&quot; was an official counting of heads, compiled by the federal government, the State, or the county.</SPAN></P>
