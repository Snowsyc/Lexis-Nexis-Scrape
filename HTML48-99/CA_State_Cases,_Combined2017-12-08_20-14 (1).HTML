Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11530, where the marijuana was in plain view after police officers opened the trunk of appellant's automobile to determine whether appellant violated gun control statutes codified at Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 171e, 12031.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed appellant put two firearms in the trunk of appellant's car on a junior college campus. Acting under the authority of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect;171c, 12031, the police officer opened the trunk to determine if the guns were loaded because the guns were prohibited in that area. While examining the guns, the officer discovered marijuana in plain view in the trunk. Appellant was convicted only for possession of the marijuana under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11530 and appellant sought review on the claim that the initial search for the guns was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the mere examination of the guns to determine if they were loaded was not an unreasonable search because the presence of the guns was prohibited by the college. Because the officers were not investigating a crime and were only complying with &sect;&sect;171c, 12031, the intrusion on appellants was minimal, there was a potential threat to public safety at the junior college due to the guns, and the statutes were applied equally, the court held that the examination for the guns was reasonable, and therefore, the seizure of the marijuana was also proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought review of an order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which denied appellant's petition for writ of mandate pursuant to Cal.  Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1094.5 to review a decision of respondent development commission that denied appellant's application for a permit to fill a parcel of land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned land within the boundaries of a state reclamation district that it contended was worthless except as a place to deposit construction fill. Appellant applied to respondent development commission for a permit to fill the property, which was denied. Appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate and damages for an alleged taking of its property without just compensation. The petition for the writ of mandate was denied and a demurrer without leave to amend was sustained. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed, holding that respondent had proper authority to deny appellant's application as part of the essential public interest and compelling economic necessity supporting the creation of the reclamation district, as enunciated in Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 66600, 66603, and 66604. The court found that the provisions of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 66622, which allowed commission members to designate proxies to act and vote in their place, was a constitutional delegation of legislative power. The court also found that the legislation that created respondent was a valid exercise of police power, and thus its actions did not constitute a taking of private property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision to deny appellant's petition for a writ of mandate and damages for a taking of private property without just compensation was affirmed. The court held that respondent development commission exercised proper authority in denying appellant's request to fill land, and that its actions in regulating the land fill were not a &quot;taking&quot; of private property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former owner appealed the summary judgment granted by the Superior Court of Orange County (California) to defendant current owner, in plaintiff's quiet title action against defendants, current owner, bank, and title insurer. The action alleged that defendants, bank and insurer, committed fraud in declaring plaintiff's promissory note in default, and that the foreclosure was invalid because of plaintiff's legal incompetence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former owner purchased an apartment building, assuming a promissory note in favor of defendant bank and a deed of trust in favor of defendant title company. After plaintiff defaulted on the note, defendant title company sold the realty under its deed of trust to defendant bank, which in turn sold it to defendant current owner. Plaintiff's action alleged that he was declared legally insane under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1368 prior to his default on the note, that defendants, bank and title company, had notice of this before it declared default and foreclosed on the realty, thereby invalidating the trustee's sale. Given that, plaintiff alleged that the sale to defendant current owner was also invalid. In affirming the judgment, the court found that it did not need to resolve any of the issues regarding defendants, bank and title company. The court found that the evidence showed that defendant current owner had no notice of plaintiff's alleged disability, was not chargeable with notice of such, and was in no way involved in either the default or foreclosure sale, but was a bona fide purchaser for value whose title was not subject to attack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment because defendant current owner of property was a bona fide purchaser for value with no notice of any fraud or other illegality that either defendant bank or defendant title insurer may have perpetrated upon plaintiff former owner. Defendant was not chargeable with notice of plaintiff's alleged disability and there was no due process violation in the notice provision of the foreclosure statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate broker sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Solano County (California), which granted respondent judgment creditor's application for an order directing payment of a prior judgment for compensatory damages against appellant out of the Real Estate Education, Research and Recovery Fund, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 10470-10483, and terminated appellant's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent judgment creditor obtained judgment against appellant real estate broker for damages in a fraud action, which included an application for payment out of the Real Estate Education, Research and Recovery Fund (Fund) under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect;10470-1048d. A hearing was held on the application with objector and respondent real estate commissioner. Appellant was present, but was prohibited by law from being a party to the hearing and defending himself on the application. The trial court ordered respondent real estate commissioner to pay the judgment to respondent judgment creditor, and automatically suspended appellant's license to sell real estate pursuant to &sect; 10475. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the award from the Fund to respondent judgment creditor, but vacated the order suspending appellant's license. The court noted that appellant was an aggrieved party within the meaning of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 938 for standing to appeal his license termination, and found that defendant was denied due process and that &sect; 10475 was unconstitutional because it provided for an automatic suspension of the license of a real estate broker or salesman without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the automatic suspension of appellant real estate broker's license without a hearing because the applicable statute for the suspension was unconstitutional, as it prohibited by law a broker from being a party to the hearing and defending himself, thereby denying him due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The order declaring the minor a ward, pursuant to section 601 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and committing him to Rancho del Campo, is affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor sought review of the order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which committed him to a ranch that was a placement facility for wards of the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent probation officer filed a petition that alleged appellant minor was a person within the provisions of Cal.

A hearing was held before a referee who found all of the allegations to be true, ordered appellant declared a ward under the provisions of &sect;601, and directed that he be committed to a ranch which was a placement facility for wards of the juvenile court. Five days after the ranch commitment, a supplemental petition was filed which said that competent medical authority stated that the minor would not adjust to the ordered program or rehabilitation. The referee found the allegations were true and ordered appellant committed to the California Youth Authority. Appellant filed a pro se appeal to each of the orders. The court reversed the referee because the commitment was never executed so the argument that the commitment was ineffective was without evidentiary support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order declaring appellant minor a ward and committing him to the ranch. The court reversed the order changing appellant's commitment to the youth authority because the lower court was not authorized to commit appellant to the youth authority until it made an order for his treatment or commitment and found facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the previous disposition had not been effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 602. The referee of the juvenile court ordered that defendant remain in the custody of the probation office. The juvenile judge, as required under Cal.  Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect; 555, approved the referee's order as required because the order deprived the parents custody of their child. Defendant's parents filed an appeal under Cal.  Welf. &amp; Inst.  &sect; 558 and after a hearing de novo the juvenile judge set aside the referee's order. Defendant appealed and contended that the judge's order approving the referee's order was a final order and that U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 were violated because he was placed in double jeopardy in the second hearing. The court held that juveniles were entitled to the same constitutional protections as adults in criminal proceedings. The court held that a rehearing pursuant to an appeal filed by a minor or his parents under &sect; 558 did not constitute a new proceeding on the same matter, and because the rehearing conducted by the juvenile judge was a part of the original proceeding, double jeopardy did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the juvenile judge's order commiting defendant juvenile to custody and held that there was no double jeopardy because the de novo hearing by the juvenile judge was a continuation of the original proceeding rather than a new proceeding to which double jeopardy would have attached.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a sexual assault against a minor and he challenged his conviction alleging a denial of the right to a fair and speedy trial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the state's delay in filing the complaint was reasonable because defendant was on trial for a murder charge and a conviction in that case would have made the present action futile and it would have caused prejudicial publicity. The court held that defendant was not improperly denied counsel at his photographic lineup because the presence of counsel was not required. The court held that defendant's identification was not the result of the witnesses' exposure to an unfair assemblage of photographs because each child was called in separately to view the photographs, was admonished not to discuss what transpired with the others, and identified a number of other distinctive features which they remembered about defendant. The court held that given the victim's age, evidence that defendant touched the victim's stomach was sufficient to constitute a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant sought review of his conviction in the Superior Court of Ventura County (California), where a jury found him guilty of two counts of hit and run driving in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant criminal defendant argued that his conviction under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 20001 was unconstitutional because complying with the law would have required self-incrimination. Evidence at trial showed that appellant was in danger of prosecution for making an illegal left turn, driving while under the influence of alcohol, and driving after his operator's license had been revoked. The court held that appellant's right against self-incrimination excused him from the statutory requirement to identify himself at the scene of the accident. However, the court found no constitutional exemption from the other duties imposed by &sect; 20001, including the duty to render reasonable assistance to any injured person. The court affirmed appellant's conviction under &sect; 20001 for his failure to render assistance to one of the injured parties at the accident scene, holding that the nature of her injuries made the duty to render aid obvious. The court reversed appellant's conviction for his failure to aid the second injured party, because a reasonable jury could have concluded that the second party's injuries were minor enough that no duty to render aid existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant criminal defendant's conviction for failing to identify himself at the scene of the hit and run because it would have violated his right against self-incrimination. But the court held that appellant was not absolved from his statutory duty to provide reasonable assistance to injured persons and affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting him for failing to aid a seriously injured person at the accident scene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, board of supervisors and county executive, sought to construct a courthouse and other county offices on a site presently within the corporate limits of the City of San Buenaventura but outside the city limits as they existed on the date the seat of justice of Ventura County was established at the Town of San Buenaventura. Plaintiff taxpayers brought suit to enjoin the construction because defendants failed to secure the consent of two-thirds of the county's voters in an election as provided in Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2. The court affirmed the dismissal because it held that the erection and construction of a new courthouse on the site selected was not a removal of the county seat within the meaning of the language used in Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2. The court found that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 23600 provided that where a county seat was an incorporated city it included all annexed territory.

The court affirmed, finding that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the municipality's police power. The information on the application, basic information such as defendant's telephone number and address, was readily ascertainable, and fingerprints and handwriting samples were outside the scope of the protections against self-incrimination in U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners moved to quash felony indictments on the ground that Spanish-named Mexican Americans were systematically excluded from consideration for grand jury nomination. The trial court announced that it would not permit petitioners to interrogate 70 grand jury selector judges as witnesses unless petitioners could show statistical evidence of discrimination in grand jury nominations for the year in which the indictments were handed down. Statistics showed that Mexican Americans were better represented than they had been in preceding years, therefore the trial court held that petitioners did not prove a prima facie case of discrimination, and the motion was denied. The court held that roughly proportionate representation did not equate lack of discrimination. The court determined that an offer of proof was not required in petitioners' case, and that refusal to permit petitioners to examine the subpoenaed judges was erroneous under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 354. Accordingly the court held a peremptory writ of prohibition was proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured was injured on the job and filed a claim with defendant disability insurer.

The court held that physical symptoms of distress were not required and that it was the jury's province to determine whether the distress was severe. In addition, the court held that threatened and actual bad faith refusals to make payments under a policy, maliciously employed in concert with false and threatening communications directed to its insured for the purpose of causing him to surrender his policy or disadvantageously settle a nonexistent dispute on the part of a disability insurer, gave rise to an independent action for tortious interference with a protected property interest for which all proximately caused damages, including economic damages, and punitive damages, were recoverable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a trial, a jury was unable to agree on a burglary charge, but found appellant guilty of contributing to the delinquency of her minor daughters.

While conceding related felony and misdemeanor counts could be alleged in the same information, appellant maintained that the trial court's jurisdiction to hear and determine the misdemeanor charge was dependent upon, and lacking without, a conviction of the felony charge. The court affirmed the conviction. The question of whether the two offenses charged were sufficiently related to permit their joinder in the same information was a matter for the court to decide and not a question for jury determination. The court's review of the evidence indicated that all the evidence introduced on the misdemeanor charge had to do with appellant's activities in the market.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff who proposed a television program to defendant producers appealed from a dismissal judgment following the sustaining of a general demurrer interposed by defendants to several counts.

Plaintiff contended that the trial court erred in finding that there was no similarity between the respective works. The court agreed, finding that upon looking through defendants' production a &quot;spine&quot; of structural dimensions similar to plaintiff's material existed. In particular, the basic themes were strikingly similar and the back stories were substantially similar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trailer park owner, in business before the incorporation of defendant city, applied to defendant for improvement permits. Defendant informed plaintiff that the trailer parks, in light of recent zoning ordinances, became nonconforming uses absent a conditional use permit issued by defendant after application therefor. Instead of applying for the conditional use permit, plaintiff filed an action for mandamus to compel defendant to issue the improvement permits, injunctive and declaratory relief, and for damages by way of inverse condemnation. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed plaintiff's action. The court affirmed. The court held that plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by Baldwin Park, California Municipal Code &sect; 9474 et seq. Therefore, the court properly sustained defendant's demurrer without leave to amend because plaintiff failed to state a cause of action. The court found that defendant's zoning ordinance applied retroactively because plaintiff did not engage in substantial building or incur expenses in connection with the proposed improvements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners student-demonstrators of Hispanic heritage organized a mass demonstration and some disturbances occurred; petitioners were indicted. The prosecution attempted to prove the conspiracy charge using hearsay testimony of alleged co-conspirators. Petitioners claimed that unless prima facie proof was first produced the court should not allow hearsay statements to prove the charge. The court agreed with petitioners and held that the conspiracy indictment was defective because there was no direct evidence to support the charge and petitioners had no knowledge that disturbances would occur. It also held that a demonstration was a constitutionally guaranteed activity under U.S. Const. amend. I., so something more than mere hearsay was required to prove the conspiracy because petitioners had a right to assemble. Petitioners also argued that the co-conspirator's statements should not be used unless the prosecution first proved a prima facie case. The court granted the writ of prohibition stating that hearsay was improper because stricter scrutiny had to be used when attempting to quash constitutionally protected activities and prima facie proof of conspiracy must first be shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner demonstrators' writ of prohibition on both the conspiracy and other misdemeanor charges. It restrained further prosecution on those counts because petitioners had a First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, right to assemble and demonstrate. It held that no direct testimony proved that any misbehavior was planned, or that petitioners knew in advance that crimes would be committed, so conspiracy charge was improper.</SPAN></P>

Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 7201 et seq., and that the procedure adopted by defendant for the allocation of sales tax revenues was proper and did not deprive plaintiff of tax revenues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiff city adopted a sales tax ordinance under the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law, Cal Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 7200 et seq., it contracted with defendant board of equalization for administration of the ordinance and collection of the sales taxes. Under a new administrative ruling, defendant began classifying pumps sold by a certain company as fixtures, which resulted in the reclassifying of the sales tax and a decrease in the amount received by plaintiff on the pump sales. Consequently, plaintiff filed a declaratory action challenging defendant's power to classify the pumps as fixtures, and attacking the legality of the &quot;pooling procedure&quot; used by defendant in allocating revenues from construction contracts. The superior court found that the pump company was not a contractor under the regulation, and that the pumps were not fixtures, but also ruled that the procedure adopted by defendant for the allocation of tax revenues was proper. Both parties appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the judgment as to the company was proper, and that defendant's pooling procedure was an accounting system rather than a regulation subject to interpretation.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 12420, and the subsequent order of the superior court denying his motion for a new trial. The statute made it a crime to possess a shell, cartridge, or bomb capable of emitting tear gas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After stopping the car defendant was driving, in response to a citizen's complaint of being threatened, officers observed a B.B. gun in the car and placed defendant under arrest. He consented to a search of the car, during which police discovered a canister defendant later stated contained tear gas. At the preliminary hearing, the state's chemist confirmed the substance was tear gas. In affirming the judgment, the court rejected the argument that Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 12420 and 12421 were unconstitutionally vague, finding irrelevant the hypothetical situations posed by defendant. The court declined to declare the statutes unconstitutional based on hypothetical situations when they clearly covered the facts of defendant's case. It also rejected defendant's claim that submission of his case on the preliminary transcript was made without his effective consent because the record showed that he was fully advised of his rights, and chose to waive them. Where defendant produced no exculpatory evidence, the court refused to find that defense counsel's submission of the case on the preliminary transcript amounted to a farce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment because the statute which defendant was convicted of violating was not unconstitutionally vague; the facts of his case were clearly covered by it, and he was not denied due process in the proceedings leading up to his conviction.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11530, and sale of heroin, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11501.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11530 and sale of heroin in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11501. Defendant appealed his convictions, but the court affirmed the judgments and rejected defendant's arguments that his prosecution by process of grand jury indictment deprived him of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court pointed out that the safeguard of the equal protection clause is equality under the law, rather than identifying rights and privileges. The court reasoned that the state's decision to prosecute certain crimes through the use of a grand jury did not deny defendant equal protection, though the grand jury indictment and the preliminary hearing information procedures were different in form, because the constitution permitted such classifications that were rationally related to the state's legitimate ends.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal court denied appellant's motion to order preparation of a free reporter's transcript of proceedings convicting him of misdemeanor disturbance of the peace. The municipal court gave appellant a 15-day extension to procure a court settled statement on appeal however appellant made no effort to do so. Appellant then sought a petition of mandate from the superior court to compel the municipal court to provide him with the transcript on the basis that he was indigent and that the transcript was essential for adequate presentation of his appeal. The motion was denied and appellant sought review. The court held that an attempt to secure a settled statement was a prerequisite to the ripening of defendant's right to a free transcript. The court also held that appellant was present at trial and therefore should be able to signify how materials not included in the transcript would be of use to him on appeal. Therefore the court held that although a non-indigent could purchase a transcript without reason, the requirement that an indigent defendant proceed first by way of a settled statement did not constitute invidious discrimination. Accordingly the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, county and board of supervisors, appealed from a judgment by the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), which directed the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate commanding them to compensate and provide benefits for plaintiff municipal court employees, equal to and with the same effective date as other county employees, and awarding plaintiffs back uniform allowances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipal court employees obtained a writ of mandate commanding respondents, county and board of supervisors, to compensate and provide benefits to them equivalent to those of other county employees and awarding them back uniform allowances. Defendants appealed. The court held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 73349, which required subsequent changes in benefits to apply equally to employees of the municipal courts and marshals' offices, was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power and did not violate Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5. The uniform allowance granted to deputy sheriffs should have applied to plaintiffs, who were deputy marshals, pursuant to &sect; 73349 because they were entitled to the same compensation under the salary ordinance. However, the trial court's ruling impinged upon the legislative power of respondent board of supervisors because it compelled them to perform a legislative act. Because plaintiffs failed to join the ministerial county officers who were responsible for the administrative steps through which the compensation would be paid, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings against those county officials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for voluntary manslaughter. Defendant was pulled over by two police officers. Gunfire erupted soon afterwards. One of the policemen was killed. Defendant denied shooting the officer and claimed he was unsure of what happened because he was unconscious after he was shot. The court reversed the conviction, holding that the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to instruct the jury as to defendant's involuntary, unconscious state. Involuntary unconsciousness provided a complete defense to a particular crime because it negated capacity to commit any crime. Defendant's evidence warranted an instruction concerning unconsciousness. The fact that such evidence might not have been wholly believable was no excuse for a failure to instruct. The error to instruct was prejudicial per se because it deprived defendant of his constitutional right to have the jury determine all material issues presented by evidence. Despite defendant's failure to request an instruction, the trial court was under a duty to instruct anyway where evidence existed concerning unconsciousness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent estate administrator sought a final accounting of an estate in probate court. Appellant state controller objected because respondent beneficiary owed taxes on a transfer out of probate, although the estate owed no taxes. The trial court held that respondent administrator was liable for any inheritance taxed owed, under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 14101, and that respondent beneficiary owed taxes outside of probate. Appellant challenged, contending that the trial court's order for distribution was improper under Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 10224 because all inheritance taxes had not been paid. The court affirmed the trial court's order settling the account. The court held that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 14143 and Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1024 applied only to taxes owed upon or that were payable out of the property of the estate and did not apply to those taxes owed by reason of transfers of property outside of probate.

On appeal, the court found impropriety in the fact that the probation officer's opinion of appellants' guilt was incorporated into the jurisdictional report, but held that the impropriety was of less than reversible dimensions. The court also rejected appellants' argument that the use of the word &quot;safety&quot; in &sect; 647(f) was unconstitutionally vague. Nevertheless, the court reversed the judgment of the juvenile court on the ground that appellants' guilt was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court assumed that the juvenile court followed the state law at the time of trial, which required proof by a preponderance of the evidence. However, a subsequent United States Supreme Court ruling required proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and the court held that the new standard was applicable to cases pending on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were tenants in possession of premises. In the trial court the real party in interest filed a verified complaint in unlawful detainer seeking restitution of the premises. Petitioners contended that Cal. Civ. Proc.

The named petitioners thereafter abandoned the premises. The superior court then denied the petitions. The court dismissed the petition as to the named petitioners, and granted a peremptory writ to the others. Section 1166a, although it afforded notice and hearing, deprived petitioners of due process because it offended the primary purpose of an unlawful detainer action and flouted the concept of fairness implicit in due process. Section 1166a also deprived insolvent tenants of the equal protection of law upon the basis that the distinction between the solvent and the insolvent in the context of the unlawful detainer statutes has no substantial or reasonable relationship to the legitimate object of an unlawful detainer action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a tropical fish dealer, imported piranha for sale to the public. Respondent, the Director of the California Department of Fish and Game, served notice upon appellant prohibiting sale of the piranha and requiring him to ship the fish out of state, destroy them, or donate them to a public aquarium. Appellant did not comply with the notice and filed a complaint alleging that the piranha would not pose a threat to natural wildlife if set at large and that Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14.671 was arbitrary and capricious, and seeking an injunction against enforcement of the pertinent regulations and a writ of mandate. The trial court denied appellant's payer for an injunction and writ of mandate and on appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. It held first that appellant's contention that the statutes and regulations prohibiting importation of piranha were unconstitutional was meritless because the determination by the state legislature that the action was necessary to protect the local ecology was a valid exercise of its police power. The court also held that the prohibition was reasonably adapted to its purpose and that appellant had no protected property rights in the fish.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged a judgment from the Superior Court, Humboldt County (California) which adjudged him guilty of violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245, assault with a deadly weapon, after he shot one of his companions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was charged with assault with a deadly weapon in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245 after he shot one of his companions in the back with a rifle. On review following his conviction, appellant contended that there was not sufficient evidence to establish that the shooting was other than accidental. The court noted that a recent U.S. Supreme Court holding had made clear that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was the correct standard to apply to juvenile proceedings involving criminal charges. Applying that standard, the court found the evidence sufficient in that appellant had told others just prior to the incident that he intended to shoot and it appeared that appellant loaded the gun. While the evidence suggested that several of the young people present, perhaps including appellant, were intoxicated, the court found that such intoxication would not be a defense where liability was not dependent upon a showing of specific intent. Because the court was unable to determine which standard was used by the lower court to weigh the evidence, it reversed the judgment with directions to the trial court to make findings and enter an appropriate judgment without a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 777 upon a finding that the previous disposition of that court had not been effective in her rehabilitation. On appeal, the court reversed that commitment order, holding that &sect; 777 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the facts set forth in the petition and proved at the hearing were not sufficient to meet the statutory standard requiring that the existing program had not been effective in the rehabilitation of the minor. Evidence of a single episode of intoxicated-like behavior did not compel the conclusion that further efforts by petitioner's parents would have been unavailing, and if the juvenile court had considered probation reports in reaching its adjudication, it erred by not summarizing them in the petition and by not proving them at the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer, a corporation that operated a nationwide retail business, was taxed based upon income that was a portion of its total net income which the taxing authorities found to be derived from, or attributable to, sources within California. Plaintiff filed suit against defendant Franchise Tax Board, seeking recovery of a portion of its corporate franchise taxes assessed and paid for six income years. The trial court denied plaintiff's claim. On appeal, plaintiff contended that defendant erred in allocating its income because it included property in transit to California in the numerator of the property factor used in the income allocation formula. The court affirmed the judgment with respect to the issues resolved by the trial court, but remanded for a determination of the amount due to plaintiff pursuant to a stipulation between the parties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on four counts of incest, three counts of oral copulation, and one count of sodomy, stemming from sexual activity engaged in between him and his 16-year old daughter. On appeal, defendant argued that the statutes proscribing incest, sodomy, and oral copulation, as applied to the facts of his case, constituted unconstitutional infringements by the state of his right of privacy. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that defendant could not cite any authority that the right of privacy constitutionally protected under the penumbra doctrine extended to a father's sexual contact with his minor daughter. The court further held that the penal statutes proscribing illicit sexual contact constituted a proper exercise of the state's police power. Further, evidence of uncharged sex offenses were admissible where they were committed on the victim of the charged offense, were in a nature similar to the charged offense, were committed at a point in time to the charged offense, and evidence of the charged offenses were substantially corroborated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) denying his petition for a writ of mandamus, for review of a decision of defendant personnel board, which dismissed petitioner from his civil servant position for dishonesty, as set forth in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19572. Plaintiff argued that the law did not authorize dismissal for acts that occurred prior to his employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee was dismissed from his civil service position based on false statements made by plaintiff in applications for three on-sale liquor licenses. It was later discovered that plaintiff was not the owner of any of the businesses, but merely received a percentage of the profits for supplying the licenses. After defendant personnel board sustained the dismissal, plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, which the trial court denied. On appeal, plaintiff argued that defendant's findings were not supported by substantial evidence and that the law did not authorize dismissal for acts that occurred prior to his employment. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that defendant's finding that plaintiff knew that his arrangement violated the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act was amply supported by the unusual and clandestine nature of the operation and his statement under oath that no person other than himself would have any direct or indirect interest in the businesses. The court also ruled that plaintiff's removal for dishonesty was proper, since his duties called for him to investigate the same type of business offense that he committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed plaintiff's dismissal from his civil service position for dishonesty occurring prior to his employment. The court ruled that because plaintiff was found to have shown serious attributes of dishonesty, unknown to the state prior to his employment, he was properly dismissed when the dishonesty was discovered, since his position called for him to investigate similar offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of respondent flood control district in appellant landowner's action for inverse condemnation. The county acquired an easement for creek bed improvements in 1878 and filed a lis pendens, but the decree in condemnation was not recorded until 1959, when the county quitclaimed its interest to respondent by recorded deed. Appellant purchased the property through which the creek flowed in 1953. Respondent completed the installation of a box culvert or pipes in appellant's portion of the creek bed, which it filled over with dirt, in 1963.

Defendant was stopped by police as a suspect for looking into parked automobiles. During questioning, defendant pulled out a revolver and pointed it at the officer. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and concluded that defendant was a felon within the meaning of &sect; 1202, and the fact that he served time in a county jail did not mean he was convicted of a misdemeanor. His confinement in county jail was imposed as a condition of probation after conviction of a felony. Defendant also failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel or that the trial was reduced to a sham. Defendant accused his attorney of being derelict in failing to locate an alibi witness, but the record showed that defendant gave the name of the witness to his counsel the day before the trial.

Const. art. XIII, &sect; 14-4/5. Plaintiff was an out-of-state corporation licensed to do business in California. In 1964, the retaliatory tax provision was amended. In computing plaintiff's taxes, defendant applied the retaliatory tax, as amended, against its assessment of plaintiff's tax liability for 1964. On appeal, plaintiff contended that the retaliatory tax as amended was only applicable to foreign insurers who were admitted after the amendment. The court held that a state can prescribe the terms and conditions on which business is conducted within its borders and that such retaliatory taxes must be strictly construed. Since nothing in the legislative history indicated an intent to apply the 1964 amendment retrospectively, it could only be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, because, strictly construed, the amended retaliatory tax provision was not to be applied retrospectively against plaintiff's tax liability for 1964.</SPAN></P>

The evidence supported the inference that the benefits were secured in pursuance of a scheme concocted by defendant and another party.

The court concluded that the judgment of the lower court with respect to conspiracy was to be modified to adjudge that defendant was found guilty of the crime of conspiracy in violation of Cal.

The court concluded that the school district was an agency of the state and that &sect; 19685 provided for tuition assessments as well as tax assessments for paying the cost of construction. The court held that &sect; 19685 required appellant to reimburse respondent its pro rata share of the construction costs, even though not in the budget, because &sect; 19685 was mandatory in requiring appellant to reimburse respondent even if the request was made after appellant's budget was approved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant marina owner called respondent state agency to inquire about changes in the level of a swollen river. Appellant relied on the information and suffered damage when the river rose beyond respondent state agency's expectations. The trial court granted respondents', state and state agency, demurrer. On appeal, the court found that respondents' demurrer was properly sustained as to the causes which were unsupported by a precedent claim as required by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 910 et seq. However, the court found that appellant could amend his complaint to allege sufficient facts to state a negligence claim and, thus, respondents' demurrer should not have been sustained as to alleged negligence in the dissemination of inaccurate river height forecasts. The court held that the determination to issue flood forecasts was a policy-making function, which was a discretionary activity within the scope of governmental immunity. However, the gathering, evaluating, and dissemination of flood forecast information was administrative and outside the scope of immunity. Because there was nothing in the pleadings about policy or decision making, the demurrer as to those causes of action was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the trial court's judgment in favor of respondent Franchise Tax Board (board). Appellant, in seeking a refund of franchise taxes, contended that it engaged only in interstate commerce and was not subject to the state franchise tax, and that even if it were, the board erred in allocating to California all of appellant's federal reserve fund interest. The board and trial court agreed that appellant's services as a steamship corporation engaged as both a husbanding and general agent for the transportation of passengers and property between American and foreign ports, were intrastate activities subject to corporation franchise tax under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus against the superior court through Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(k) after his motion to suppress evidence was granted. The state sought a writ of mandate for review of the order which suppressed evidence. The court held that defendant's statement &quot;Over on the kitchen sink&quot; contributed to the discovery of the murder weapon, a knife, but that the knife would have been discovered by the police because it was in plain sight even if the subject statement had not been made. The court held that securing of the knife was purged of any primary taint that might have attached to it on the basis that the statement was illegally obtained. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5 was proper for bringing a motion to suppress evidence on the ground that it was obtained as the fruit of an illegal statement, and that when the motion to suppress was granted, the state was entitled to petition for a writ of mandate as provided by &sect; 1538.5(o) to review the validity of the order.

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the evidence was sufficient and the decision of respondent school board should have been sustained. The hearing officer did not allow petitioner to present evidence of discrimination, but that was within his discretion. There was no deprivation of fair hearing and due process because Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11512 permitted a delegation by respondent board of all its functions of fact-finder and decision-maker even after its earlier intention to exercise such functions directly. It was the burden of petitioner to show error by respondent board. The complete transcript was not available for examination to determine what was offered during the course of the hearing or to determine if there was prejudice. The limited transcript did not show evidence that the hearing officer was in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that a writ of mandate should issue and held that petitioner teacher had not sustained her burden to show error by respondent school board. The court directed the trial court to enter judgment in favor of respondents, school board and superintendent, and awarded respondents costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by police officers driving on the wrong side of the road and was arrested after he failed roadside tests. Subsequently, defendant steadfastly refused blood tests at the hospital. A blood test was taken after a police officer struck defendant with a closed fist. Defendant's blood alcohol level was entered into evidence, and defendant was convicted of misdemeanor drunk driving pursuant to Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102(a) in municipal court. Defendant sought review in the appellate division of the superior court, which affirmed his conviction. The court accepted certification under Cal. R. Ct. 63(a) to secure uniformity and settle questions of law. The court reversed the conviction of misdemeanor drunk driving. The court held that the U.S. Const. amend. IV's bounds of reasonableness were exceeded because defendant's blood test was not drawn according to accepted medical practices. The court reasoned that, although the factual determination of excessive force would normally be entitled to great weight, the municipal judge improperly focused on the technical, rather than forceful, aspects of defendant's blood test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted certification and reversed the decision of the lower court that affirmed defendant's conviction. The court determined that because the police used unlawfully excessive force to obtain the blood alcohol test, accepted medical practices were not followed and the constitutional bounds of reasonableness were exceeded. Therefore, the judgment of conviction required reversal.</SPAN></P>

On review the court denied the writ, holding that as there was no controlling federal law or regulation, it concluded that under California decisional law it was for the jury to decide whether the carrier's failure to provide seat belts amounted to negligence. The court noted that the toll of highway injury and death was such that judicial policy should be against deferment to legislative inaction and in favor of having juries pass upon the question until such time as the legislature chose to adopt supervising safety regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for the first-degree murder of his infant son and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant contended that the superior court erred in admitting certain photographic evidence at trial, that it failed to properly instruct the jurors, and that it was error to deny his motion to reduce the crime to second-degree murder. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in admitting photographs into evidence showing the bruised condition of most of the infant's body. The court found that the primary purpose of the photographs was not to inflame the jury against defendant but were primarily relevant in that they revealed injures so brutally inflicted as to show an abandoned and malignant heart and supported the prosecution's theory of sexual motivation for the crime. The court held that the superior court was not required to instruct the jurors that they had to agree unanimously on the theory upon which they determined guilt. Finally, the court found no error in the rejection of medical opinion regarding defendant's diminished capacity and in the denial of a motion to reduce the degree of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer was driving in an area where many burglaries had occurred when he saw a man dart across the street and disappear. The policeman pursued while calling for assistance. However, visual contact was lost. Ten minutes later, the policeman saw one of the responding officers apprehend defendant. Checking over the police radio, officers learned that defendant was on parole and that he had been arrested for burglaries and other offenses in the past. They also learned that a burglary had been committed shortly before. Defendant was placed under arrest and his vehicle was searched. The police found ammunition, both expended and unexpended. Later, a stolen revolver was found near where defendant was apprehended. It was determined that the shells in defendant's car had been fired from the revolver. The court rejected defendant's contention that the search of his automobile at the time of his arrest was violative of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment standards. The court held that having reasonable cause to believe that defendant committed a burglary, it was reasonable for police to conclude that the vehicle, which was immediately before them, might contain stolen property.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the issuance of the writ of mandate by the trial court on the basis that the trial court did have the authority not to suspend the driver's license.

A loaded pistol was found on defendant. One of the officers then turned his flashlight on the spot where defendant had been crouching and observed a revolver located about three inches from where defendant's right leg had been. The revolver was found to be loaded and the official serial number on the butt end of the revolver had been removed, but the serial number had not been removed from two secret locations where the manufacturer had placed the number. Defendant was convicted of unauthorized alteration of identification number on a handgun and of carrying a loaded firearm without a permit in a public place. The court held that the crime of unauthorized alteration of identification number on a handgun was complete upon the removal of the identification number from the frame of the revolver. The court determined that the fact that other serial numbers on the revolver had not been altered was immaterial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by an indictment with unlawfully selling and furnishing heroin, unlawfully possessing heroin, and having a prior conviction of a felony offense. Defendant initially filed a motion to quash the indictment but that motion was denied. Defendant ultimately pled guilty to the selling charge and the prior felony charge when the district attorney agreed to drop the possession charge. The trial court found defendant to be a narcotic addict and ordered his commitment to the department of corrections for narcotic rehabilitation. Defendant challenged the order, arguing his order of commitment was predicated upon his plea of guilty, but the indictment charging him with the crimes was constitutionally invalid, so his guilty plea could not stand. Defendant argued that the presence of persons other than the witness under interrogation before the grand jury violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 939. The court found the record of the grand jury proceedings contained ample evidence to support a true bill under the indictment procedure. Because there was no prejudice shown in the alleged errors, a reversal of the indictment was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

The court characterized the preliminary injunctions as patently ambiguous and ill-defined and held that they exceeded the power of the trial court. The court also held that the club owners had failed to show such irreparable injury as would entitle them to injunctions enjoining criminal prosecutions where the constitutional validity of the statutes involved was unchallenged, because the evidence was not sufficient for the trial court to infer that the motive of the sheriff was interference with freedom of expression rather than law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from a judgment of dismissal of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) entered after his failure to post security, as required by an order that determined he was a vexatious litigant, and ordered him to post $ 5,000 in cash, or bond, within 10 days of the order, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 391- 391.6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that the vexatious litigant statute was unconstitutional, the showing made by defendant to support the order and the judgment was inadequate, and the propriety of other rulings affected his right to an adequate hearing on the issues raised by the demand for security. The appellate court stated the statute was upheld against many of the grounds of attack raised by plaintiff and that a reading of the language and definitions found therein revealed that his attack was groundless. The court determined that plaintiff acted diligently in requesting a continuance because of his inability to attend two hearings at once and in relying on the reasonable belief that it would be granted. Moreover, plaintiff acted diligently in urging that defendant's motion for security was interposed too late. The fact that the court did not believe him and refused to give him an opportunity to be heard on the merits should not have defeated his right to have the matter reopened when all of the facts were before the court. The court ruled there was no evidence to sustain one of the two proposals, which the order on which it was predicated stood.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that plaintiff's attacks on the constitutionality of the vexatious litigant statute were unwarranted, that there were irregularities which prevented plaintiff from having an adequate hearing on the issues raised by defendant's motion for security, and that the judgment be reversed because the showing made by defendant was inadequate to support the order upon which the judgment was predicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When they went outside to investigate noises, a work camp owner's nephew and grandson were grabbed by defendant and another person and taken back into the home office. Defendant had a knife with a six inch blade and the other man had a gun. The grandson was struck several times and tied up. The nephew was held down and a ring was stolen from his pocket. A cash box was also stolen. Both boys identified defendant as the perpetrator. The prosecutor used defendant's statutory rape conviction to impeach his character. The trial court held that it could not sentence defendant to probation without the prosecutor's concurrence. On appeal, the court held that defense counsel's failure to move for a new trial did not render his assistance inadequate because of defendant's waiver and because the case was not close. The court held that although the statutory rape conviction was not a particularly sound basis for impeachment, it was permissible under Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 788 and was not prejudicial. The court held that the trial court should have made a determination under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203 as to whether the case was an unusual one and whether or not probation was appropriate on that basis.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, defendant demanded a jury trial, after which defendant was committed to the Department of Corrections. Defendant argued that he was denied due process for failure of the court-appointed psychiatrists to testify at the hearing, which rendered void the order committing him to the mental hospital for a period not to exceed 90 days. The court held that defendant was accorded full procedural due process because he stipulated that the doctors' reports were sufficient. The court further held that the superior court's action in returning defendant to the municipal court for further proceedings was proper under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5512 because the mental hospital opined that defendant was not able to benefit from treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an information accusing defendant of the violation of &sect; 667, he was charged with having suffered six previous convictions of felonies for which he had served a period of imprisonment. It was only necessary that one prior be established to invoke the part of &sect; 677 which brought about felony punishment. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 677. Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that the statute was unconstitutional, and the court affirmed. The court held that the classification was proper; the court could not say that the Legislature was unreasonable in taking the position that it was more serious for a person who had previously been convicted of a felony (or of petty theft), to again commit petty theft than for a person who has not been so convicted previously to do so. The court held further that defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated by the procedural scheme of &sect; 677 because admitting the priors was not truly an incrimination; it was only conceding the existence of a previously adjudicated circumstance which placed defendant in a heavier punishment category.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the district's demurrer and dismissed the landowner's complaint without leave to amend. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that &sect; 6 was not unconstitutional because (1) the state had a compelling interest in the reclamation of waste lands through flood protection, drainage, and irrigation works, and (2) the statutory voting formula was necessary to further this compelling interest. The court determined that the grant of franchise in proportion to the value of land ownership fairly distributed voting influence among those primarily and directly interested in direct proportion to the stake each landowner had in the district. The court held that the landowner was not entitled to cumulative voting rights pursuant to Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 2235 because the provision did not apply to the district.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's attorney also stipulated that defendant had a prior conviction for a drug violation. In the second trial, the jury convicted defendant. Defendant argued that the trial court should have granted her motion for a new trial because the conduct of her defense counsel had reduced her trial to a sham and a farce. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the Act covered the solicitations being carried on by the salesmen, that such coverage was constitutional, and that the salesmen were not entitled to conduct door-to-door solicitations for free pest control inspections without securing a license under the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Act covered door-to-door sales because, by denying a general exemption for all employees and by not granting authority to unlicensed employees to solicit or otherwise secure work, the clear implication of the Act was that unlicensed employees could not solicit or otherwise secure structural pest control work. Further, the court found that the Act, which regulated door-to-door solicitations, was constitutional because there were many rationally acceptable hypotheses for the requirement that a licensed operator perform his own direct contact with owners or hire a licensed field representative to perform that activity.

On appeal, defendant argued that he could not be guilty of the crime because his conduct consisted of the use of words unaccompanied by violence or the threat of violence. The court found that defendant deliberately wore a jacket with language that was clearly offensive and below the minimum standard of propriety and the accepted norm of public behavior. Defendant's conduct was more than a quiet and peaceful assertion of his convictions about the draft. Defendant was not subjected to prosecution for expressing his political beliefs. His right to speak against the draft and war was protected by the First Amendment. However, he did not have the right to express his views by means of printing lewd and vulgar language which was likely to cause others to breach the peace to protect women and children from such exposure. Defendant's conduct in this case went beyond the permissive ambit of the First Amendment's protection.</SPAN></P>

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 17000- 17101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants advertised certain products, as to which the food market was in competition with plaintiff, below their cost. Plaintiff sought an injunction to prevent defendants' actions on the basis that their actions violated the California Unfair Practices Act, which prohibited the sale of products below cost when the effect was to injure competitors or destroy competition. Plaintiff relied for proof of the wrongfulness of that conduct on the statutory presumption set forth in Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17071.5, which stated that selling a product below cost raised a presumption of an intent to injure or destroy a competitor. The trial court ruled that the presumption was unconstitutional and, because there was no other evidence sufficient to support plaintiff's case, judgment was entered for defendants. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the statutory presumption was valid because there was a reasonable relationship between the conduct involved and the fact presumed. There was a rational connection between the limitation of the quantity of goods sold below cost, and any requisite evil intent to justify requiring defendants to prove that they had an honorable intent.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that the Department's works of improvement interfered with the store's rights of access and exposure. An actionable interference was established. Contrary to the Department's contention, the trial court did not err in holding the liberation of Old First Street for parking could not be considered in evaluating special benefits.  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1248(3) limited special benefits to those arising from the construction and improvement proposed. Here, the development of parking was no part of the Department's work; hence, the development could not constitute a special benefit. Finally, the trial court did not err prejudicially in instructing the jury that the store's rights were substantially impaired. Under Cal. Evid.

Under California law, the foreign national was entitled to a full distribution of the decedent's estate and the state was not entitled to any right or title therein or distribution thereof.

Penal Code &sect; 653g, which the accused alleged was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused handed out anti-draft leaflets at a school, which gave notice of a student meeting.

The accused entered a plea of not guilty and commenced an action for a writ of prohibition. The writ was denied. The accused appealed. The court reversed and granted the writ. Section 653g was not constitutionally invalid because it was construed to apply only to loitering for the purpose of committing a crime. Because facts alleged in the complaint showed that the accused was lawfully handing out leaflets, there was no public offense under &sect; 653g. The facts did not support loitering to contribute to the delinquency of a minor in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 272 because the leaflet urged attendance at a meeting, but not during school hours. Even if it had, a one-day absence was not habitual truancy. Because the charge was not contained in the indictment, it violated due process. The state's construction of &sect; 653g violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it was content based.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued the unconstitutionality of certain laws and regulations relevant to the infractions for which their licenses were revoked. They also argued that the orders suspending the field representative's license for 15 days and the operator's license for 180 days, subject to three years' probation and a 30-day suspension, were harsh, arbitrary, and not in the furtherance of duty. They claimed that the requirement for restoration bonds was an abuse of discretion. The court agreed with the board's position that appellants' points were neither sufficiently relevant nor were their authorities sufficiently germane to be persuasive. In the absence of a clear and convincing demonstration that the challenged provisions of the act were arbitrary or were incapable of furthering a lawful purpose under the police power, the court found them constitutional. In light of the fact that the operator made double infractions and had a previous violation, the court held that the requirement of a restoration bond within the statutory limits was not an abuse of discretion. However, the court held that the requirement of a restoration bond from the field representative must be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, plaintiff steel company sought review of summary judgments from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), rendered in actions denying it injunctive relief and damages against defendant water and power department. The steel company sought injunctions to prevent the department from performing a contract awarded to a bidder using foreign steel under the California Buy American Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 4300-4305.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act required that contracts for the construction of public works or the purchase of materials for public use be awarded only to persons who agreed to use or supply materials, which have been manufactured in the United States, substantially all from materials produced in the United States. The issue presented on appeal was whether the Act violated the United States Constitution. The court concluded that the Act was an unconstitutional encroachment upon the federal government's exclusive power over foreign affairs, and constituted an undue interference with the United States' conduct of foreign relations. The court found that the Act, in effectively placing an embargo on foreign products, amounted to usurpation by the state of the power of the federal government to conduct foreign trade policy. Furthermore, the court found that the Act amounted to an attempt by the state to structure national foreign policy to conform to its own domestic policies. Therefore, the court concluded that the Act was an unconstitutional intrusion into an exclusive federal domain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into a property settlement agreement in conjunction with their divorce.

Later he exchanged the preferred shares for convertible preference stock. The wife alleged misrepresentation of community property at the time of the settlement and asked for declaratory relief. The husband argued the evidence did not support the findings and the damages were excessive. The court ruled that the evidence supported the findings that the representations and concealments of the husband were false, that he fraudulently induced the wife's counsel to make the agreement effective as of a certain date in order to cover up and conceal the fraud, and that, by reason of fraudulent concealments and representations, and by reason of the retention of the additional preferred shares, the husband became a constructive trustee for the benefit of the wife of one-half of the additional shares.

Moreover, it held, in considering the ordinance, it was to be presumed that defendant made inquiry to determine whether there was an evil to be remedied and that the classification recognized in the ordinance was the result of such an inquiry. It held that defendant's determination to regulate only services inside its limits was not so palpably unreasonable and arbitrary as to be discriminatory. Finally, it held that the ordinance was not an unreasonable exercise of defendant's police power, noting that the state required applicants for various other licenses, credentials, or jobs to be fingerprinted or photographed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the cosmetologist also argued that &sect; 6522 as amended in 1967 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, concluding that (1) it was not unreasonable for the legislature to say that, although cosmetologists could cut hair in the course of their broader practice of cosmetology, an establishment which was engaged primarily in the business of haircutting had to use those who were trained and registered as barbers; (2) the statute was discriminatory only in the sense that any licensing system discriminated by making specified activity lawful only for those persons who qualify for and obtained a license; and (3) there being a reasonable basis for the limitation, no invidious denial of equal protection was involved.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's probation was revoked because he allegedly advocated violation of the narcotic laws. Defendant appealed his conviction and probation revocation. The court dismissed defendant's appeal from the order of commitment because it was not an appealable order. Noting that defendant's freedom of religion objection to the constitutionality of &sect; 11530 and its companion sections previously had been considered and denied, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court then held that the probation condition did not violate defendant's constitutional right of free speech because it only prohibited the advocacy of violation of the narcotic laws so long as they were in force, and it was that advocacy, not political argument, that defendant was found to have made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an administrative hearing the Board suspended the licensee's structural pest control license for a period of 10 days.

The regulations of the Board that resulted in the licensee's suspension did not violate its equal protection rights because the climatic and geological conditions of California were conducive to wood-destroying pests and organisms and regulations to protect property owners from ignorant, incompetent, or dishonest pest control operators were within the authority of the legislature to permit. The court was without power to review the extent of the penalty imposed by the Board because it was within the legislatively set limits under Cal Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 8697.3.

When the package fell out on the seat the outside wrapping came apart, as did a box wrapped in it, and a brown paper bag fell out of the box. The postman opened the bag and saw what turned out to be out to be marijuana. A search warrant was issued and evidence seized. Real party in interest was charged in an information filed in the superior court with the crime of possession of marijuana. The real party in interest filed a motion to suppress evidence, which was granted. The superior court judge found that the marijuana in question was not accidentally discovered, but was discovered by an act in clear violation of the federal statutes and postal regulations protecting the privacy of first-class parcels and letters. The people appealed pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(o). The court denied the people's writ and held that the opening of the bag was a search. The court held that the prosecution failed to show legal justification for the postman's search.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and a co-defendant allegedly engaged in a bunco operation that relieved an individual of his money and in place thereof left him a wad of paper with a dollar bill wrapped around it in a sack. Defendant and the co-defendant testified that they had played craps with the alleged victim for several months prior to their arrest and that the victim and the co-defendant had gotten into an argument over a dice game in which the victim had lost considerable money. The victim testified that he had never seen defendants prior to the incident in question and that only two months before that he had been in Vietnam. Defendant challenged his conviction. The court held that there was more than sufficient evidence to convict defendant. Defendant also waived any issue concerning the victim's in-court identification. Lastly, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1025, which required the presentation of evidence of defendant's prior convictions at the same time that proof of the substantive crime was presented, did not deprive defendant of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The state then moved for an order requiring the recorder to record the certified copy of the order. The trial court found that the recorder had the duty to accept the order for recordation without requiring the payment of the tax by the condemnee, and held that the final order of the court following a condemnation trial was not a sale of realty within the meaning of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 11911. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance did not mention final orders in condemnation proceedings. The court found that neither the ordinance nor the enabling legislation limited the applicability of the legislation to &quot;voluntary&quot; as opposed to &quot;involuntary&quot; sales. The court found that the recorder must record a final order in a condemnation proceeding properly presented to him pursuant to the provisions of Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court affirmed the finding that nontherapeutic sterilization was lawful in California where competent consent was given, as there was no public policy prohibiting consensual sterilization operations. The court further found that the trial court rendered judgment on questions bearing upon the scope of medical care under publicly sponsored welfare programs; however, there was no evidence on those issues. It held that, as there was no controversy on those issues, it was an abuse of discretion to render judgment on those questions and modified the judgment to reflect that voluntary non-therapeutic surgical sterilization operations were legal in the state of California and deleted the remainder of the declaratory portion of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court first found that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 601 was not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. The court then concluded that the superior court did not err when it admitted defendant's statements because they were made after administration of the Miranda warnings and were not the result of an illegal detention. Further, the court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to indicate that defendant was in danger of leading a dissolute life, for purposes of &sect; 601. However, because the proof of the allegation rested solely upon the admission of the minor, the order was reversed. Defendant properly contended that proof of the commission of the drug-related felony was addressed under the same standards as a petition under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 602. An informer's tip constituted inadmissible hearsay.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XI, &sect; 11, entered in the owners' action to have defendant county's ordinance declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners challenged a county ordinance imposing a license fee on mobile homes. They contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional because the state had preempted the field. They also contended that the proposed fee was too high. The trial court entered a judgment that the ordinance was not invalid. On appeal, the court held that the facts and the law supported the findings and judgment of the trial court. Although generally the state had taken over the question of taxing mobile homes and regulating their major uses, the legislature had specifically authorized the action taken by the county ordinance. As for the amount of the fee, the presumption was in favor of its reasonableness. That the county had not fully regulated the licensing of mobile homes or had set a fee that was inadequate to cover the expenses of regulation did not prevent it from increasing its fees for regulation to a reasonable amount when it had jurisdiction to control the fee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the county ordinance and the license fee imposed by the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a licensed general contractor, submitted a bid for the construction of a high school. In the preliminary compilation of its bid, the contractor included the cost of mechanical work from a subcontractor. The contractor subsequently found a bid that was $ 41,500 less than the other subcontractor's bid and reduced its total bid by that sum. The contractor later discovered that the subcontractor's bid on which it relied did not include the automatic fire sprinkler system and that the reasonable cost of furnishing and installing such a system was $ 88,500. Exercising its discretion under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 4110, the school district assessed a penalty of $ 77,000 against the contractor. This sum was equal to 10 percent of the subcontractor's bid and it was to be deducted from the amount earned by the contractor in performance of the prime contract. The trial court sustained the school district's general demurrer. The court noted that the penalty assessed was the monetary maximum of $ 77,000. The court held that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 4110 was unconstitutional because it failed to provide the contractor with notice and a hearing prior to the imposition of the penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed sitting on a retaining wall located near the city jail, holding a shotgun. He was convicted of the Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4574 offense, and the judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court first held that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that defendant knew that he was on grounds adjacent to a jail, for purposes of &sect; 4574. Defendant was only three feet away from the doorway that was inscribed with the name of the jail. The inferences logically drawn from the facts supported the conclusion that he knew he was near the jail. The court then rejected the claim that the prosecution failed to prove that defendant had the specific intent to facilitate an inmate's escape from the jail. Specific intent was not an element of &sect; 4574, but rather of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4535, with which defendant was not charged. The court further ruled that defendant's right to equal protection was not denied by the prosecution's decision not to charge him with &sect; 4535. Finally, the court held that defendant was not shielded by the Second Amendment from prosecution under State weapons possession laws and that the offense encompassed acts performed outside of the jail.</SPAN></P>

The only respondent on appeal was the California Public Utilities Commission, which intervened below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stockholder's predecessor bought a certain number of the water company's shares. The commission later declared that the purchase of the water company stock by the stockholder's predecessor was in violation of law and was void. The stockholder obtained an injunction preventing the water company form transferring or cancelling those shares except to him. The commission intervened in the action and it was on the commission's motion that the subject injunction was set aside. The court found when the stockholder obtained his injunction, the commission's order holding the acquisition of the subject shares to be void was in effect. The injunction, then, was calculated to interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties in violation of Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 1759. Moreover, that same statute gave the state supreme court exclusive jurisdiction to review orders of the commission. Therefore, the injunction was properly set aside. The court rejected the stockholder's due process argument because he had the opportunity to appear before the commission or to ask for recission of its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student contended that she qualified as a &quot;resident&quot; student because she became a resident of California through operation of law by her marriage to a California resident on July 1, 1967. She argued that she should be able to retroactively &quot;tack on&quot; her husband's period of residency in order to meet a one-year residence requirement as of the first day of classes in the fall of 1967, and maintained that certain constitutional rights she possessed were being violated by the board's treatment of her as a &quot;nonresident&quot; student. The court held that the regulation classifying students as residents or nonresidents for tuition purposes was not arbitrary or unreasonable and had a rational nexus with the State of California's objective of providing publicly financed institutions of higher learning. Further, the court ruled that the student was not being denied the equal protection of the laws, and the board was not running afoul of the privileges and immunities clause, because residents and nonresidents could be treated differently where there were valid reasons for doing so.

Regardless of whether the board proceeded under Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code art. 1, &sect;&sect; 103.31(c), 103.34 or Los Angeles, Cal., Mun. Code art. 3, &sect;&sect; 103.31(c), 103.35 the same review applied, and the same result would have followed. The standards were not indefinite or vague and broader protections that applied in First Amendment causes did not apply. The hearing officer properly took into account that the crimes committed by the licensee had no relation to his repair business. Finally, neither the ordinances nor their application interfered with his right to liberty or his pursuit of happiness.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the specific reason given by the trial judge for the new trial, that he did not believe the evidence presented by appellants in support of their case against the driver, was sufficient to justify the new trial, when he observed the witnesses testify and considered their biases and ability to see the events of the accident in resolving the inconsistencies in the evidence.

The evidence did not sustain a finding that the passenger's injuries proximately resulted from the wilful misconduct of defendants under the guest law, Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 17158. The trial court correctly ruled as a matter of law that the accident occurred while the passenger was riding as a guest &quot;upon a highway,&quot; and the guest law applied. The court held that there was no evidence to show a quarrel or anger on the part of the driver. If there were some reason to support the necessary state of mind for a deliberate foolhardy act on the part of the driver, it would have been fully explored during the case in chief. The facts of the case, including losing control of a car and hitting an object off the side of the roadway, were insufficient to establish wilful misconduct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the school bus driver was unconstitutionally deprived of his school bus driver certificate. On appeal the court found that school bus drivers were properly given a special classification, and the California Board of Education could properly require in school bus operators qualifications of good character and higher standards of driver performance than those imposed for the issuance of general operators' licenses.

Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, div. 2, pt. 1, &sect;&sect; 6001-7176.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board contended that the retailer should have collected use taxes for California on sales of goods delivered on credit at its Oregon and Nevada stores to customers who held charge accounts bearing an address in California. The court held that existing precedents under the due process clause precluded the board from burdening the retailer's Nevada or Oregon business with the collection of use taxes on over-the-counter sales to California residents. The court held that the fact that the retailer elected to carry on an intrastate business in California was purely fortuitous and did not give California the right to reach out and tax or otherwise burden transactions which were entirely dissociated from the local business. In addition, the court held that the discriminatory imposition of a liability to collect the California use tax unwarrantedly burdened the right of the out-of-state retailer to do business with residents of California, in violation of the commerce clause. The court held further that because the effect of the tax was to impose upon the retailer a greater burden than was imposed upon those engaged in similar business, the retailer had been denied equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The property owner filed an action for trespass and conversion, and after the jury returned a verdict in favor of the property owner, the property owner appealed alleging that the trial court erred in finding and instructing the jury that the property owner was not entitled to compensation for the taking and use of any interest she had in the street. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the street was a public street that was under the dominion and control of the city and that any interest the property owner held to the centerline of the street was subject to the city's right to use the street for the benefit of the public.

The teachers also sought a declaration that the Winton Act (Act), Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect;13080- 13088, was unconstitutional because it classified certified teachers separately from uncertified teachers and required they present employment issues collectively. The trial court concluded that there was insufficient evidence of discrimination to warrant a writ or to require reemployment of the executive secretary, and that the Act was constitutional, requiring the teachers to address employment issues through a negotiating council. The court agreed, holding that there was no constitutional violation by segregating certified teachers through legislation mandating the bargaining procedures with their employer in that they were treated equally within the class. Substantial evidence supported the conclusions as to discrimination and reemployment of the secretary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The materialman supplied carpeting for a house on behalf of a contractor for the landowner's tract homes. In an affidavit, the materialman's attorney averred that he gave the landowner's attorney telephonic notice of the mechanic's lien. The trial court dismissed that action based on the materialman's failure to append the written notice to the third amended complaint, required by Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1193. The materialman argued that the telephone call from its attorney to the landowner's attorney constituted substantial compliance with the pre-lien written notice, that the landowner should be estopped from relying on &sect; 1193, and that &sect; 1193 discriminated against materialmen who installed carpeting and was thus unconstitutional. The court rejected those arguments and affirmed the trial court's order, finding that &sect; 1193 required a written pre-lien notice in order to advise an owner that his property could be subjected to a lien arising from a contract to which he was not a party. Consequently, the materialman could not show that an estoppel was warranted. Finally, there was no constitutional compulsion for special treatment of materialmen furnishing carpeting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions, alleging that certain evidence was inadmissible as the result of an illegal arrest or illegal search and that the evidence was insufficient to prove knowing possession of drugs. Defendant also contended that his waiver of a jury trial was ineffective and that the statute prohibiting and punishing the possession of marijuana was unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's arguments. The police officers were justified in relying on information from apartment managers to arrest defendant because the managers were objective private citizens who were acting openly for the purpose of aiding law enforcement. The information gave the officers reason to believe that defendant had been in knowing possession of the marijuana. Accordingly, the arresting officer was justified in arresting defendant. The resulting search of defendant's car was incident to the lawful arrest and was sufficiently restricted in scope to be incidental to the arrest. Defendant's waiver of a jury trial was effective because there was no evidence that he or his counsel was misled. Finally, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11530 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to object that this evidence could not be used as substantive evidence, and did not request that a limiting instruction be given. Defendant was convicted of the possession offense and the court affirmed. Defendant's failure to object did not preclude him from raising the substantive use of prior inconsistent statements as an issue on appeal because at the time of his trial, a statute permitting such use of the evidence was not held to be unconstitutional until after the trial was concluded. However, defendant was not prejudiced by admission of the prior inconsistent statements without a limiting instruction and his conviction was affirmed because the inconsistent statements were not the sole basis for the verdict, and there was other substantial evidence supporting the guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district (district) discharged the food service employees and negotiated with a vending company to supply fool through vending machines. The court held that the school employees association had standing because its interest was in establishing for the benefit of its displaced members that the food services to be rendered under the proposed contract were a mere substitute for those which were discontinued and as such were illegal because they were to be performed by nonclassified employees. The court held that Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 17052, 17101 demonstrated that the Legislature intended that the sale of food through vending machines was to be governed by the chapter of the code under review. Since the law expressly contemplated that vending machines could be used for dispensing some of the food which the district was authorized to sell and serve, there was no inherent reason why all such food and drink could not be so dispensed. The court also held that the fact that a private entrepreneur made a profit from the equipment that it furnished did not make the school's contribution to the food service process a gift to him.</SPAN></P>

Consecutive sentences were imposed by the trial court against defendant of six months in the county jail for the trespass and for the required term in the state prison for the battery.

The court found that no facts showed an abuse of discretion by the Adult Authority. There was no proper basis to make a factual determination of the prisoner's contention that two of his several prior convictions were invalid. It was the exclusive function of the Adult Authority to make discretionary judgments as to whether and when an eligible prisoner would be granted parole or discharged within the limits fixed by law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dairy sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which sustained a demurrer brought by defendants, county and its director of public health, and dismissed the dairy's petition for writs of mandamus, certiorari, and prohibition brought in response to the director's order to discontinue its production of raw milk until it was free of pathogenic organisms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a public health code, the county director of public health ordered the dairy to discontinue its production of raw milk for sale and to pasteurize all milk that it produced for distribution until it no longer contained bacteria. The dairy conceded that its raw milk contained a small quantity of bacteria but that it was not harmful for human consumption. The dairy brought an action for mandamus based upon the denial of substantive and procedural due process because the action taken by the director was without notice or hearing and unlawfully precluded the dairy from the enjoyment of a valuable property right. The trial court dismissed the dairy's petition. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision. The court affirmed dismissal of certain causes of action which were redundant. However, the court held that the language of the health code in which the director relied upon set up no machinery or procedure for reviewing the order and made no provision for a hearing. The court held that it was not an adequate procedural remedy of review. The dairy was entitled to a trial de novo consistent with the fundamental principles of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the dairy's petition for mandamus and remanded the cause for trial. The court also affirmed the dismissal of certain causes of action brought by the dairy which contained the same factual allegations but sought relief on different theories of law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the order did not violate the contemnors right of free speech because the trial court could properly ensure a fair trial by taking certain steps to control pretrial publicity of evidence and facts likely to have been presented to the jury. The court held that the order need not have been drawn to limit disclosure of specific information that could have had a prejudicial effect on the trial because that would have been impossible to determine. All that was required was enough specificity so that the parties knew what was proscribed. The court also found that the order was issued based upon the clear and present danger test where there was wide scale student disorder at the university. Finally, the order was not overly broad when it was also directed at potential witnesses.</SPAN></P>

The officer observed marijuana through a tear in the bag, and defendant and his co-defendant were arrested. Defendant argued that the officer had no right to detain them while waiting for a radio check on the authenticity of the identifications they had furnished. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of conviction because there was nothing unreasonable about the officer's calling for a check on their identification or in detaining them for a few moments while awaiting a report. The court also held that there also was nothing improper in his questioning of the suspects or in his making the joking statements that led defendant to open his bag.

Defendant was the paramour of the victim's mother and was living in the mother's home. The evidence tended to show that, after a night of drinking, defendant severely beat the victim. Several witnesses also testified that defendant had previously mistreated the victim. At the sheriff's office, defendant agreed when one of the officers suggested that defendant had beaten the victim, when the victim awakened and defendant couldn't quiet the victim down. After the victim's older sibling was unable at trial to remember the events on the night in question, a police officer was allowed to testify based on a written report containing a statement previously made by the sibling. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the officer's testimony to establish the sibling's past recollection recorded, in admitting prior consistent statements to rehabilitate a witness after a charge of recent fabrication, and in failing to give a necessarily included offense instruction. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. There had been no miscarriage of justice, and the evidence supported defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal of the student's complaint. The court questioned the student's assertion of a right to keep anonymous his relationship as an officer of the organization in the absence of any immediate and direct threats of physical or other danger. The rights of rank and file members to remain anonymous were clearly delineated and if the information concerning the identity of the organization and the names of its officers were disclosed, the additional disclosure of the names of the rank and file members would not have served a legitimate state purpose. The court held that the compelling interest of the public in being able to ascertain the information contained in the registration statement outweighed any minimal infringement of the student's First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was charged with striking a person with a motor vehicle, in violation of Cal. Veh.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that even though defendant's alleged delinquent act would have been chargeable as a criminal offense had he been an adult, juvenile delinquency proceedings were nonetheless considered to be inherently civil, and not criminal in nature; thus, the preponderance of evidence standard used in other civil proceedings was properly applied to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was suspended from attending school because of the length of his hair. He brought an action in mandamus, through his mother to compel reinstatement. The school district and its governing board appealed from the trial court's order directing issuance of a writ of mandate as prayed. The school district and the school board contended that the dress policy at the high school, to the effect that extremes of hair styles were not acceptable, was a reasonable exercise of the governing board's rulemaking power in the area of student discipline and that it was not constitutionally unenforceable by reason of its language. The court stated that the school district policy concerning extremes of hair styles restrained the student's freedom of expression guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. In this area, the standards of permissible statutory vagueness were strict and the government could regulate only with narrow specificity. Therefore, the court affirmed the order directing issuance of a writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court that directed an issuance of a writ of mandate in favor of the student. The court held that the school district's and the school board's dress policy concerning extremes of hair styles was over broad and vague and hindered the student's freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asked her name and then stated that he thought he got the wrong girl. Slides taken from the witness showed human spermatozoa, and there were seminal stains on defendant's shorts and trousers at the time of his arrest. Defendant's driver alleged that they picked up a girl, drove to a lot, they got out, and he drove away. The court affirmed. There was no constitutional violation of reading an indictment to the jury that referred to defendant's prior conviction or of presenting evidence of the prior convictions to the jury at the same time that the proof of the substantive crime was presented; a bifurcated trial was unnecessary. Further, the court followed the Theodore rule as to proof of the prior convictions; that is, in the absence of other contrary testimony, the identity of names, coupled with proper proof of prior convictions, was sufficient to sustain a finding that defendant was the person involved in the earlier cases.</SPAN></P>

Appellants asserted on appeal that the legislature did not intend to deprive the superior court of authority to entertain a petition for adoption of an adoption agency minor by other than agency selectees. The court found that appellants failed to offer any authority for that statement. Appellants contended that &sect; 224n was unconstitutional because in denying them as foster parents the right to adopt an agency child, they were being denied the equal protection of the law and due process. The court found that the provision in &sect; 224n which prohibited anyone but the prospective adoptive parents selected by the adoption agency from adopting a child relinquished to such agency was a reasonable one. The agency should be free to make a determination of the suitability of a home for the child. The statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The real parties in interest filed a petition for writ of mandate in the lower court. The lower court dismissed the petition, but the real parties in interest obtained an ex parte order from another judge to restrain the department from enforcing its suspension order pending an appeal from the order dismissing the petition for writ of mandate. The department sought to have that stay order vacated by writ of prohibition. The court found that, under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23090.5, the lower court was without jurisdiction to review the final order of the board or to stay enforcement of the suspension order. The court considered the argument of the real parties in interest that &sect; 23090.5 was unconstitutional in that it precluded superior courts from reviewing the validity of an administrative determination. The court rejected the argument because the section did not totally impair the right of judicial review. The court granted the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the defendants' general demurrer without leave to amend and granted their motion to dismiss. The court concluded that the trial court erred in granting the motion to dismiss; however, none of taxpayers' contentions had merit. As such, rather than a judgment of dismissal, the trial court should have entered its judgment decreeing expressly that the taxpayers were not entitled to the declarations they sought. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was modified by striking references to the motion to dismiss and inserting in lieu thereof a provision that the ordinance did not violate and was not prohibited by the federal and state constitution and the city charter and that the bonds issued were not null and void and were valid as against the contentions of the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board suspended the corporation's permits for false, misleading, and illegal advertising. The trial court set aside the penalties stating that they were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of the board's discretion, and not supported by substantial evidence. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the imposition of lighter penalties on other companies for similar customs and practices had no bearing on whether the corporation violated the law. The court found that, because the board imposed separate penalties for each statutory violation, the corporation's partial exoneration did not compel a remand of the case. The board's penalties could have been held unreasonably severe only if they imposed an unreasonable hardship on the corporation. The court stated that declarations of the corporation's secretary alleging such hardships was not properly introduced into evidence and was inadmissible as hearsay evidence. The court found that witness testimony that the penalties would cost the corporation well over $ 100,000 was unsupported by any computations and fell short of establishing unreasonable hardship to the corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted defendant after a jury trial of burglary of the second degree, denied defendant's motion for anew trial and motion in arrest of judgment, denied his application for probation, and sentenced defendant to an indeterminate prison term. Prior to the trial, defendant admitted the truth of the allegations of the prior convictions of felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While responding to a silent alarm, a police officer saw defendant coming out of the gate to a school. He was carrying a radio and wore mismatched gloves. A pry bar he tossed into his car matched the indentation on a window frame that looked like the point of entry. Defendant argued in part that he did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel upon his arraignment; his prior convictions were improperly admitted in evidence; the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct; and the indeterminate sentence law was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the magistrate did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's motion to have a deputy public defender appointed to sit in an advisory capacity while defendant represented himself at the preliminary hearing. The court found that defendant could not challenge the validity of his prior convictions for the first time on appeal and was not prejudiced by the prosecutor's suggestion that information about the school's security system might fall into the wrong hands. The court concluded that the indeterminate sentence law was not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's constitutional argument but found merit in the contention that there was a lack of evidence of the use of a firearm. The court found that defendant's use of a firearm in his prior felony conviction was an essential element of the charged offense and unless it was proven, violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12560 was not established. The court noted that although defendant's prior conviction was for assault with a deadly weapon, not all deadly weapons were firearms. The court declined to take judicial notice of the transcript of defendant's preliminary hearing pertaining to the prior felony because the transcript was not offered at trial and to do so would be to deny defendant the right of trial by jury.

The court found that, only where there was a general state law conflicting with a city ordinance was the ordinance unconstitutional.  Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 7523.1 was not a delegation of legislative power to local governments to engage in licensing in the area of vehicle repossession and, thus, the state statute specifically prevented preemption of the entire field of law.

The court rejected defendant's contentions that her actions had not caused or contributed to the accident and that if they did she was unaware of that fact. The evidence at trial established that her action in turning into the intersection in front of the station wagon was an efficient cause of the latter's colliding with the truck and that therefore defendant was involved in the accident. The court ruled that compliance with &sect; 20001 did not require defendant to confess responsibility for the accident or to be a witness against herself.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner agricultural workers sought an action to compel enforcement of orders adopted by the Industrial Welfare Commission (Commission) establishing wages and hours for women and minors in agricultural industries. The order had been stayed pending outcome of other actions brought by relator employers. The court found the orders valid, ordered enforcement by respondent enforcement agencies, and ordered the superior courts to vacate their stays. The Commission's quasi-legislative role exempted it from stringent constitutional due process requirements, such as cross-examination of public hearing witnesses. The Commission's determination was judgmental as well as factual, so that it could rely on witness opinion without the oath requirement. Relators had access to the hearings and underlying studies upon which the orders were adopted. The minimum wage was appropriate based on a statutory provision implying discretion, and a policy that the rate be &quot;not less than&quot; adequate. Overtime rates harmonized with provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and legislative intent. Federal statutes did not preempt the orders in the absence of case law or legislative intent to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted defendant school district' motion for summary judgment in the taxpayer's action to test the validity of bonds issued pursuant to a school bond election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought an action that challenged the validity of bonds issued against the school district who were granted authority to conduct and certify the regularity of election proceedings under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 21708. The school district brought a motion for summary judgment that was granted by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court called the taxpayer's appeal frivolous because he failed to argue that he had a vested right in the results of the first counting of ballots and that the later recount pursuant to Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 1443 had unconstitutionally deprived him of this right. The court held that a validating statute with respect to the bonds of public bodies enacted by the legislature that included school district's within its scope was dispositive in the case. The court held that such a curative statute served to validate all defects in an election proceeding with the exception of those that resulted in constitutional rights violations. The court held that mere irregularities of procedure in the election were not constitutional rights violations and the bonds issued were valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were observed by a victim, who did not see their faces, but testified to the characteristics of the two men who fled his apartment. A police officer stopped defendants based on their description, and one of them picked up a stolen purse from the street. Defendants jointly contended that they were illegally stopped and that the fruits of the arrest were erroneously admitted, that evidence of the victim's identification of defendants was erroneously admitted, or in any event, admitted without a finding by the court that the procedure was fair and reasonable. The court held that no question of illegal arrest, search, or seizure was raised in the trial court and the issue could not be raised for the first time on appeal. Furthermore, the evidence failed to disclose any search. It was also clear that there was no unfairness in the identification procedure. The totality of the circumstances had to be viewed in the light of the identification that resulted. The victim at no time attempted to unqualifiedly identify either defendant as one of the persons who was in his driveway. This identification did not diverge from rudimentary fairness. The convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the ordinance was not unconstitutional. The court held that the ordinance was basically a nuisance ordinance, and it was appropriate for such an ordinance to be directed against dangerous conditions without regard for the cause of the condition. The court also held that it was not unconstitutional that the ordinance required correction of a condition that is dangerous to persons, property, and the public highway. The court further held that defendant's objection to the ordinance as possibly subjecting a landowner to unlimited expense was irrelevant because defendant was challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance on its face only.</SPAN></P>

The court found that such evidence sufficed to constitute larceny by trick. Furthermore, the court found that defendant took these funds impressed with a trust, so he was guilty of embezzlement. The court found that there was an implied promise by defendant that he would return any unutilized funds from the letters of credit and that the complainant parted with her money on the basis of the representation that she would get her money back if the funds were not utilized.

The licensee requested an attorney and stated that he would not take a test without his doctor and witnesses. At an informal hearing requested by the licensee, the referee recommended suspension of his driver's license under &sect; 13353. The trial court set aside the suspension based on a finding that the licensee was not obliged to make a statement to the officer after having requested and been denied counsel. Thus, the trial court found no refusal to take the test. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, finding that the Fifth and First Amendments did not protect the licensee in refusing to submit to a test under &sect; 13353. Further, the licensee could not qualify his consent on the condition that the test be administered by his physician. The right to counsel did not apply to the consent or refusal to submit to a test under &sect; 13353.

The sister was dead, and the estate was substituted through her husband who was the defendant as administrator and an individual. The administrator argued that a trust was never created; that the trust instrument violated the statute of frauds; that the trust letter was never delivered by the sister to the former prisoner; that the former prisoner was civilly dead and lacked the capacity to create any trust because of his conviction and sentence to life imprisonment; that any trust was void; that the former prisoner's civil rights could not be restored to any degree; and that, if a trust had been created, that the administrators should have been compensated for their services.

Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 844.6, 845.2 had protected the city from liability for prisoner injuries, the court held the arrestee had been a prisoner under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 844 because the arrestee had been booked, as provided in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 7(21). The court also stated the test for determining if an arrestee was a prisoner was not whether the arrestee had been informed against, indicted, arraigned, tried, or convicted. Finally, the court rejected an argument that the California Tort Claims Act of 1963, of which Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 844.6, 845.2 were a part, was unconstitutional because the state had delegated its own immunity to subordinates entities, such as the city.</SPAN></P>

Such decision was adopted by the Department and affirmed by the Board. The licensees argued that &sect; 25656 was unconstitutional because it violated U.S. Const. amends.

Specifically, the court found that the enactment of &sect; 25656 was a proper exercise of the police power of the State of California and noted that &sect; 25656 did not abridge the privileges and immunities of or deny equal protection of the laws to the licensees as employers, any more than it abridged the constitutional rights of the woman who was their employee.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the survivors did not have a claim for the wrongful death of a presumptive employee caused by the contractor's presumptive negligence, because Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3708 only permitted such actions when the alleged employer did not have workers' compensation insurance. The court rejected the survivor's alternative claim for strict liability because the decedent was an employee of the independent subcontractor, and general contractors were not liable for injuries suffered by the employees of independent contractors. The court also ruled that the survivors had no nuisance claim under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3712 because &sect; 3712 only applied in the employer and employee context.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction entered by the Superior Court of Merced County (California), which found defendant guilty of murder in the second degree in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim, his girlfriend were in the backseat of a car. The were arguing about defendant's relationships with other women and their own relationship. Defendant threatened to kill the victim several times and finally shot her in the chest. Defendant contended that failure to bring him to trial within the 60-day period as provided for in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1382(2) violated his rights to a speedy trial. The court disagreed. The court found that whether a delay in completing a persecution amounted to an unconstitutional deprivation of rights depended upon the circumstances. The 24-day delay was not prejudicial to defendant where it was not purposeful or oppressive, was the result of the unavailability of witnesses, was for good cause, and did not affect the outcome of the proceeding. In addition, where defendant failed to discharge his duty of going forward with evidence of mitigating circumstances to the point of raising a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors, the presumption of malice operated and the homicide was deemed malicious and an act of murder. Without mitigating evidence there was no reason to reduce defendant's conviction to manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

An arbitrator determined that the insured was not barred by limitations from recovering and awarded her damages.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the insurer and held that &sect; 11580.2 did apply to accidents occurring prior to the statute's effective date. The court held that the insured should have either filed suit or demanded arbitration within one year after the statute's effective date. The court also found that the insured's untimeliness meant that the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to arbitrate and, that therefore, the arbitration proceeding did not preclude the trial court from deciding all issues.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that there was no error in excluding jurors opposed to the death penalty if their opinions precluded finding the defendant guilty. Additionally, the record failed to disclose any instance of incompetency of defense counsel.

The court held that: (1) defendant's objection to the wife being called as a witness did not have legislative sanction, there was no authority that bringing a witness into court in prison garb was prejudicial, and the showing of a conviction of a prior felony was proper in impeaching one's own witness; (2) defendant was not in custody when he made a damaging admission and the admission was made after proper Miranda advisement; (3) the corpus delicti was established by an abundance of evidence independent of the defendant's admissions; and (4) defendant's counsel's failure to object to leading questions did not indicate incompetency.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that if the landowner wished to introduce evidence about the higher value of his land upon its rezoning to a residential classification, the city had the right to introduce evidence that the landowner would be forced to dedicate the disputed strip.

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the statute did not violate the constitutional guarantees against special and arbitrary legislation because it provided for a different right of contribution among tortfeasors who may be liable for injuries caused by the disaster from that applicable to tortfeasors in general. The court held that good grounds existed for the distinction made between the parties responsible for the Baldwin Hills damage and tortfeasors who may have been liable for a common injury in general. A right of contribution among tortfeasors tended to promote multiplicity of litigation because it permitted a tortfeasor against whom judgment had been rendered to bring a new and separate suit for contribution against other alleged tortfeasors not named in the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council adopted an ordinance, Riverside, Cal., Ordinance No. 3300, that fixed each councilman's expense allowance to a certain sum per month but did not require proof of such expenditures. The taxpayer contended that such ordinance was in violation of the city charter, which did not allow the city councilmen to be compensated for their work, even though their expenses could be reimbursed. The court upheld the validity of the ordinance. The court found that the trial court erred when it went behind the ordinance and received evidence aliunde to establish facts that would tend to impeach and overturn the law. The city council, when it passed the ordinance, was presumed to have made a finding of fact that each city councilman's expenses were at least $ 350. The trial court's review should have been confined to a consideration of those facts, which appeared on the face of the ordinance, together with those facts within its judicial knowledge, rather than testimony as to the actual monthly expenditures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner business owner brought a proceeding in mandamus to compel respondent, the director of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (California), to extend the time for cancellation of the owner's liquor license for a reasonable period of time after such time as the pending accusations against the license were ultimately determined, or until such time as the Department consented to the transfer of said license to other persons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought a writ of mandate to compel the director to grant an extension of time under Cal. Admin. Code tit. 4, R. 65 within which the license could be cancelled. The owner argued that a cancellation of its license pursuant to Rule 65(d) would be unconstitutional and in excess of the Department's jurisdiction. In denying the petition, the court found no merit in the owner's contention. The power of the Department to adopt a rule such as Rule 65 was derived from Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22 and Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 25750. The court noted that the power of the Department to adopt rules such as rule 65 and to interpret them could not be questioned, so long as the agency, under the guise of its rule making power, did not abridge or enlarge its authority or exceed the powers given to it by the statute. The court found that in adopting Cal. Admin. Code tit. 4, R. 65 the Department did not exceed the powers given to it, nor did it thereby seek to abridge or enlarge its authority. The court concluded that Rule 65 was constitutional in its opinion and that the owner had not made out a case for judicial interference with the decisions of the Department of which it complained.</SPAN></P>

After a second trial, the employee was acquitted and reinstated. He sought back pay for the time during the dismissal. The court on appeal found that such back pay was impossible because the school district had not adopted any regulations under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 13601 to allow for such reimbursement. The court further found that the district had not adopted the merit system of employment which would have afforded appellant the relief sought under &sect; 13742. The court held that compensation to the employee without benefit of one of these two authorities would violate the anti-gift provisions of Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 31, 32. Finally, the court held that the fact that not all school districts were required to adopt a merit system under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 13742 did not mean that the statute violated Equal Protection because the legislature had presumably found meaningful differences between the various school districts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a passenger in an automobile which struck another car, was taken to the hospital for a blood alcohol analysis. In the hospital a struggle broke out between defendant and several highway patrol officers. The officers testified that defendant initiated violence against the officers, but defendant claimed that he had only refused submission to physical force of the blood alcohol test. The court concluded that the jury instruction given by the trial court regarding a defendant's right to refuse a blood alcohol test was improper and reversed. It was apparent that under some circumstances enforced blood withdrawal would evoke the exclusionary rule. Thus, the instruction's blanket rejection of a right of refusal resulted in an incorrect statement of law. Moreover, the court found that the instruction was an abstraction only, not pertinent to the issue before the jury. Finally, the error was prejudicial in that it virtually told the jury that defendant's claim of passive resistance was devoid of constitutional right, depriving it of recognition in law whatever its credibility in fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision of the Municipal Court of the Whittier Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California), which sustained defendant's demurrer and entered a judgment dismissing the charge of possession of a pinball machine, pursuant to Santa Fe Springs, Cal., Ordinance 25, &sect;&sect; 1-6 (1957). Defendant had successfully argued that the state's gambling law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330, preempted the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the city was incorporated, its residents were subject to a county ordinance that prohibited possession of pinball machines. After incorporation, the county ordinance became inoperative. The city then enacted Santa Fe Springs, Cal., Ordinance 25, &sect;&sect; 1-6 (1957) to continue the prohibition against pinball machine ownership. Defendant was charged with a misdemeanor under the ordinance; but the municipal court dismissed the charge and held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 330, which barred games of chance but not of skill, had preempted the ordinance. The state appealed. The court examined the language of the ordinance and of the statute. The court found that the state legislature did not intend to cover the entire field as to regulation of pinball machines. The court explained that the ordinance was a mere supplement to the state law and was not preempted. Whether the pinball machine in this case, however, was predominantly a game of chance or a game of skill was a question of fact. The court reversed and directed the municipal court to allow defendant to replead to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the state's gambling laws excluding pinball did not preempt the town's power to enact a public ordinance prohibiting pinball machines. Whether the pinball machine was a game of skill permitted under state law or a game of chance prohibited by state law was a question of fact. The court reversed and instructed the municipal court to allow defendant to replead to the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The accident victim argued that shortening the statute of limitations for suits against public employees to six months rather than the normal one-year limitation period created an arbitrary and unreasonable classification. The court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that the accident victim's action was filed after the expiration of the six-month limitation period. The court stated that the decision of the legislature as to what was a sufficient distinction to warrant a classification would not be overthrown by the courts unless it was palpably arbitrary. The court determined that the statute did not create a class out of a class, but applied to all suits against public employees for damages or injury caused by them while acting within the scope of their employment.</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 75000-75109, as amended by Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 75075- 75079 (1959).</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 75032, 75060.6 to retirement benefits amounting to 50 percent of the current salary of the holder of the office to which they had last been elected. Plaintiffs contended that under a new statutory amendment, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 75075- 75079, they were entitled to higher benefits. The court disagreed. Because plaintiffs ceased to occupy any judicial office when they retired, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 75002 suggested that the legislature considered them not to be &quot;judges&quot; after retirement. Thus, none of plaintiffs fell within the class described in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 75075(b). In addition, &sect; 75075 on its face excluded plaintiffs by the phrase &quot;hereafter retiring.&quot; The legislature understood &quot;hereafter retiring&quot; to mean retiring after the effective date of the amendment, because only judges so retiring could qualify for receipt of Cal. Gov't Code art. 3.6 benefits by electing, in writing, at or prior to retirement, to receive them.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed from the judgment. One issue on appeal was whether defendant's dual sentence violated the proscription against multiple punishment. The court held that when a series of connected crimes was incident to one objective, the defendant could be punished for the most serious offense but not for more than one. Here, the evidence pointed to two acts of robbery; taking of the bar receipts and taking of the victim's personal funds at the scene of the shooting. However, all of defendant's actions were incident to the single objective of robbery, and only one punishment for the more serious crime was permitted.

As the police officers approached the care they smelled marijuana and asked defendant and the driver to get out of the car. The officers observed that defendant's eyes were bloodshot and watery, his pupils were dilated, and his speech was slurred. They arrested defendant, then searched the automobile and found two marijuana cigarettes. Defendant was convicted of unlawfully being in a place where narcotics were used with knowledge that such activity was occurring, in violation of &sect; 11556. On appeal, his conviction was affirmed. The officers had reasonable cause to stop the car because of the missing license plate. They had reasonable cause to arrest defendant based upon their observations of his appearance and behavior. Therefore, the search was incident to the arrest and was valid. There was ample evidence that defendant had knowledge that marijuana was being used as required by &sect; 11556. The court held that an automobile was a &quot;place&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 11556. The court also held that &sect; 11556 was constitutional because it required knowledge that unlawful activity was occurring.</SPAN></P>

Defendant demurred to the second charge as unconstitutional for ambiguity and vagueness. The court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the charge. The prosecution appealed, and the appellate court reversed and remanded, certifying the appeal in order to settle an important question of law. On review, the court determined that the charge, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 602.7, was constitutional. The claim of ambiguity or vagueness on the face of the statute lacked merit, and the section was constitutionally immune from attack. The court saw no uncertainty in the statute that punished defendant's refusal to move upon an order by a university official where the act was likely to interfere with public property. In reversing dismissal of the charge, the court held that &sect; 602.7 did not require the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that because &sect; 661.1 barred recovery against the operator because the skier was his guest, it conflicted with 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 526l of the Motorboat Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of the crime of failing to provide for minor children as charged in the information.

The propriety of the instruction, which directed the jury to find defendant guilty if certain facts were found to be true beyond a reasonable doubt, depended upon its including all of the legal elements essential to the verdict. The court also held that (1) the presumption of Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trespasser refused to leave a county welfare office until the officials agreed to provide assistance to an impoverished family. The officials refused to agree to the trespasser's demands. He remained in the building after hours and after he was asked to leave. He was arrested and charged with a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 602(o). The trespasser filed a writ to prohibit the municipal court from prosecuting the case. The trial court granted the writ and permanently stayed all further proceedings. On appeal, the court reversed. The court concluded that the law was properly enforceable for the protection of the county's buildings and to carry out public business. The fact that county officials did not see fit to request the trespasser to leave the building on a prior occasion did not give the trespasser a right to repeat his actions and to fail to comply with the law. The fact that the trespasser was a good deed for the benefit of a needy family did not excuse a breach of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of the municipal court and against the trespasser and reversed the judgment. The court directed the trial court to set aside the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which dismissed the school district's complaint that sought an injunction and writ of mandate against respondent State Board of Education (board). The school district also sought to have the Unruh School Act of 1964 (Act), 1965 Cal. Stat. ch. 132 (First Executive Session 1966) declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district sought a writ of mandamus and in effect charged the board with an abuse of discretion in rejecting a locally formulated plan for school district reorganization and in submitting a plan devised by the board to the electorate in lieu thereof. The school district also challenged the constitutionality of the Act, which altered school district boundaries and the disposition of district funds. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the school district had sufficient standing to challenge the constitutionality of legislation, which the school district contended directly affected its boundaries, its property, and its funds; (2) the transfer of the property of one district to another district did not constitute a taking of property without due process of law because the legislature had plenary power over school districts; (3) Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 17676 did not violate Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 because the statute operated uniformly throughout the entire state and benefited every district that was similarly situated by voting for unification; and (4) Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 17676 did not violate Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 11 because no district or elector was coerced.</SPAN></P>
