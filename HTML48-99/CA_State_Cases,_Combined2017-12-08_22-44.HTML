</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's remedial order of May 2, 1991, insofar as it approves funding of an emergency loan to the District from appropriations for the Oakland Unified School District and the Greater Avenues for Independence program.  In all other respects, the court's orders of April 29 and May 2, 1991, are affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant government sought review of a decision from the Superior Court for Contra Costa County (California) that directed appellant to ensure that students of a certain school district would receive a full school term or its equivalent. Appellant contended that it did not have a constitutional duty other than to provide an equal allocation of funds to all school districts within the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent concerned parent filed for a temporary and permanent injunction seeking to force appellant government to ensure that a local school district would not close its schools six weeks before the end of the year due to budgetary problems. The lower court, after a hearing, found that appellant was responsible for the fundamental educational rights of students and that it must remedy a local district's inability to provide an education basically equivalent to other districts in the state. The lower court ordered appellant to ensure that the students would receive a full term or its equivalent. The lower court also approved an emergency plan and an emergency loan to accomplish the plan. Appellant contended that it had no constitutional duty other than to allocate educational funds equally between the various school districts within the state. The court affirmed the lower court's decision and found that public education was a fundamental concern of appellant and it had to provide all students a basic fundamental education. The court found that the lower court's order was proper except where it ordered money be distributed from specially earmarked funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court order that directed appellant government to ensure that students of a certain school district would receive a full school term or its equivalent. However, the court set aside that portion of the order that distributed money from funds that had been validly earmarked for other purposes by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the denial of his motion to change venue during the guilt phase was proper and that the evidence was sufficient to establish all the necessary elements of the crime and the aggravating factors. The court noted that the matters pertaining to jury deliberations did not constitute error. As for the penalty phase, the court noted that no prosecutorial misconduct occurred and defendant waived this issue by his failure to object. The court found that no instructional error took place during the penalty phase and the statute was constitutional and denial of the application for modification was proper and supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder and attempted robbery, six counts of robbery, and two counts of assault with a firearm. An allegation that defendant personally used a rifle in the commission or attempted commission of each of the foregoing offenses was found to be true.

Finally, the jury found to be true a special circumstance that the murder occurred during the commission of a robbery. Following a penalty trial, the jury sentenced defendant to death, and the trial court denied the automatic motion to modify the verdict. The appeal was automatic. Defendant challenged the guilty judgment on the ground he was improperly shackled in court, that evidence of other crimes was improperly admitted, and that the death penalty was unconstitutional.

Defendant denied any involvement in the offense, but he was convicted. During the penalty phase, the jury found that defendant had used a deadly weapon and had committed the murder for financial gain and, thus, sentenced defendant to death.

Applying a deferential standard of review, the court held that &sect; 10012.1 did not violate defendant's First Amendment rights because the content restriction was reasonably related to the statutory goal of providing voters with information about judicial candidates and there remained numerous other channels by which a judicial candidate could convey criticism of an opponent to the voters. The court also found that &sect; 10012.1 did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court because the content restrictions imposed on defendant's judicial candidate statement by the election code were permissible under the First Amendment and did not violate defendant's equal protection rights. The court directed the appellate court to affirm the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, state assemblyman, state senator, and city council member, sought review of a California appellate court's denial of their request for a writ of mandamus to invalidate a campaign reform measure adopted by the voters of the City of Los Angeles and to enjoin respondents, mayor, members of the city council, city controller, and city clerk, from enforcing the measure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of Los Angeles adopted a campaign finance reform measure that provided for public funding of campaigns for city offices. Petitioners, state assemblyman, state senator, and city council member, filed suit in the appellate court for a writ of mandamus to invalidate the measure and to enjoin respondents, mayor, members of city council, city controller, and city clerk, from enforcing it on the grounds that it violated Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 85300, which banned public financing of campaigns. The appellate court denied the writ. The court granted review and affirmed. The court first determined that the measure implicated a municipal affair under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 and that it posed a conflict with state law. The court then concluded that &sect; 85300 was a matter of statewide concern, as it was reasonably calculated to address the state's interest in the integrity of elections, but that it was not narrowly tailored to meet that concern because the use of public funds to finance elections would not have a corrupting influence on the elections and a ban on public funding would frustrate the goal of electoral integrity. The court thus held that the reform measure was enforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that a marital residence that appellant ex-husband and respondent ex-wife, now deceased, held in joint tenancy was community property under Cal.

The court reversed that judgment on appeal, finding that the case involved property division on dissolution of marriage under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1(d) because respondent's death did not deprive the trial court of its retained jurisdiction to decide collateral property rights. The court also reasoned that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1(a)(3) explicitly stated that &sect; 4800.1 applied to a property division on dissolution of a marriage regardless of when it was acquired. The court also held that appellant was not deprived of a vested property interest without due process of law because his survivorship interest was subject to the condition precedent that he outlive respondent. The court further concluded that the house's deed did not contain a clear statement that it was separate property, and the record contained no proof as to a written agreement that it was separate property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted defendant of four counts of first degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 with a multiple-murder special-circumstance finding under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(3). Defendant was also convicted of one count of attempted murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 664 and 187.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot three victims at a park, two of whom were members of a different gang than defendant. About two weeks later, he shot and killed a couple he once met at the home of a witness. Defendant was convicted by a jury of four counts of first degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;187, with a multiple-murder special-circumstance finding under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(3), and one count of attempted murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 664 and 187. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that the trial court's refusal to sever the offenses was not an abuse of discretion due to the fact that defendant failed to show a substantial danger of potential prejudice from the joinder of the offenses. The court further held that evidence of defendant's gang membership was relevant to the motive for two of the murders and therefore admissible. The court held that victim impact evidence was admissible at the penalty phase, and that although biblical references in the prosecutor's closing argument were improper, there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would have reached more favorable verdicts had the misconduct not occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder and attempted murder because he failed to show that joinder of the charges against him deprived him of a fair hearing and, thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for severance. It was not error to admit evidence of defendant's gang membership or victim impact, and improper biblical references in the prosecutor's final argument were not reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for first degree murder in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California). The jury found appellant guilty of two first degree murders and found true the special circumstance allegation of multiple murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of the first degree murders of two men pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 and found true the special circumstance allegation of multiple murder pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2 (a)(3). Appellant charged the prosecutor with prejudicial misconduct during the guilt phase argument because she quoted from a dissent in a United States Supreme Court case, to the effect that law enforcement had an obligation to ascertain the true facts surrounding a crime, while the defense did not. In affirming the conviction, the court disapproved the comment, but ruled that appellant was not prejudiced in light of the admonishments issued by the trial court. Appellant also objected to the prosecutor's suggestion during the penalty phase argument that the jury consider defendant's youth as a factor in aggravation. Appellant argued that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3, factor (i), age could only function as a factor in mitigation. In affirming the sentence, the court ruled that while the jury must be allowed to consider all relevant mitigating evidence including age, no rationale precluded its consideration as an aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's first degree murder convictions and death penalty sentence. The court held that the United States Constitution did not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecution proved each aggravating factor, that the circumstances in aggravation outweighed those in mitigation, or that death was the appropriate penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a habeas corpus petition consolidated with his automatic appeal, petitioner challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which convicted him of felony murder and rape of a boarder, and of the attempted murders of a boarding-house owner and her son.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a petition consolidated with his automatic appeal, petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his conviction for the first-degree murder and rape of a woman and two attempted murders. A jury found appellant murdered a female boarder with a butcher knife and attacked the boarding house owner and her 10-year-old son. The surviving victims testified that appellant stopped at the boarding house in which he used to live, drank three beers with the owner, and then asked to sleep on a couch. He then attacked the victims. Petitioner contended his counsel ineffectively failed to investigate or present evidence of petitioner's mental disorder caused by Vietnam combat experiences. Petitioner also contended the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the required intent to kill in felony murder. The appellate court affirmed the judgment and denied the habeas corpus petition, holding that intent to kill was no longer a required element of a felony-based special circumstance. The appellate court also held that because petitioner invented his combat experiences after he was convicted there was no evidence to alert defense counsel to a need to explore the defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which convicted him of two first-degree murders in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187, and one count of robbery with the personal use of a firearm in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211. The jury returned a sentence of death. Under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bodies of a man and his four-year-old son were found by police on the floor of a jewelry store. Each victim had been shot in the head at close range with a .38 caliber gun. The lower court convicted defendant of two first-degree murders, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 and one count of robbery with the personal use of a firearm, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211. The jury found to be true the special circumstances that the murders were convicted during a robbery and that defendant was guilty of multiple murders. The jury returned a sentence of death. The lower court judgment was affirmed. The reviewing court held, among other things, that defendant was not illegally arrested or detained and that his statements to police were voluntary. Defendant's waiver of Miranda rights was not ineffectual. Defendant was not entitled to have a witness deprived of his constitutional right against self-incrimination. Defendant failed to raise the ineffective-waiver argument in support of his motion under Miranda, and the argument was therefore waived. At the time of his trial, defendant had no statutory right to only those jurors who resided in the county of the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, robbery, using a firearm in the commission of each offense, and the special circumstance of committing murder during the robbery, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187, 189, 211, 12022.5(a), and 190.2(a)(17)(i). Defendant appealed and filed for a writ of habeas corpus on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. Because the court granted the writ, stating that the failure of defendant's trial counsel to object to certain evidence amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel, the appeal was rendered moot, the judgment was vacated, and the matter was remanded for a new trial. In addressing several evidentiary matters likely to arise in retrial, the court found that the trial court properly exercised its discretion and weighed the probative value of photographs of victim against their prejudicial effect before admitting them. The court found that evidence of defendant's debt was improperly admitted to establish defendant's motive to commit the robbery and murder. The court concluded that jury instructions omitting lesser offenses were not error because the evidence did not support instructions on lesser offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant's appeal of his murder conviction was moot because the court vacated the judgment against defendant by granting defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus, based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In an effort to avoid errors on retrial, the court approved the admission of photographs of the victim and the jury instructions omitting lesser offenses, but rejected evidence of indebtedness to show motive.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in plaintiffs' favor on certain environmental impact issues but refused to find the voting limitation in the act unconstitutional. The appellate division reversed and held that &sect; 57103 was unconstitutional. The court reversed and held that &sect; 57103 was constitutional because &sect; 57103 did not impinge on the right to vote in a manner that required the application of a strict scrutiny analysis.

The court reinstated the trial court's judgment, concluding that the ordinance was a reasonable content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation that could survive a U.S. Const. amend I challenge, passing a two-part test: the ordinance was designed to serve a substantial governmental interest in reducing the secondary effects of &quot;adult&quot; businesses, relieving appellant from some of the regulatory burden by shifting it to the private sector and protecting the commercial tax base, and the ordinance allowed for reasonable alternative avenues of communication because shopping centers and abundant land for commercial development were available. The court further held that the U.S. Const. amend I inquiry was not concerned with economic impact, and even considerable economic difficulty in locating &quot;adult&quot; uses fell short of establishing that respondent adult bookstore owners were unreasonably restricted by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals to the extent that the DMV violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution by imposing higher license fees and use taxes on vehicles originally purchased outside of California. The court reversed the remainder of the decision of the court of appeals and held that that persons who paid use taxes, prior to when the DMV altered its practice of collecting use taxes based on the actual cost of a vehicle, were not entitled to refunds. Further, the court held that the class claim, as filed by plaintiff, was not authorized by statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the court of appeals erred in summarily denying the request by petitioners, health care providers, for a writ of mandate. The court issued an alternative writ of mandate and held that the trial court erred in allowing patients, real parties in interest, to amend their complaint. Injury was directly related to the professional services provided by petitioners; therefore, punitive damages were barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Los Angeles County (California), convicting him of six counts of first degree murder, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187; mutilation of human remains, Cal. Health &amp; Saf. Code &sect; 7052; and attempted murder and mayhem, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187/664, 203; and he was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his request to act as co-counsel, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements, and that the trial court erred in permitting posthypnotic testimony from a witness. The court ruled that defendant did not have a right both to be represented by counsel and to participate in the presentation of his own case, and that defendant did not unequivocally assert his right to self-representation. Further, the court held a desire to have an attorney in the future, coupled with an unambiguous willingness to talk in the meantime, was not an invocation of the right to counsel requiring cessation of a police interrogation. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the judgment, concluding that testimony from a witness who underwent hypnosis for the purpose of restoring his memory was inadmissible as to all matters relating to those events.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting and sentencing defendant was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded where the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant access to a law library, defendant failed to demonstrate that his right to assistance of counsel would have been impaired if his motion to replace his court-appointed attorney was denied, and the admission of testimony by a witness who underwent hypnosis was improper.</SPAN></P>

After the robbery, appellant asked his cousin to keep the gun he had used in the murder. The court held that appellant was not entitled to suppress the evidence of the gun because appellant had no expectation of privacy in his cousin's residence. Appellant was initially deemed incompetent to stand trial. After a later examination that determined that appellant was competent to stand trial, defense counsel and the prosecutor stipulated to the admission of the psychiatric reports. The court held that a stipulation on the issue of competency did not violate appellant's constitutional right to a hearing. The court held that there were no irregularities in the selection of the jury, that evidence was properly admitted, and that appellant received effective assistance of counsel. The court concluded that the evidence supported the jury verdict that appellant killed in order to advance a robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an unlicensed individual and associated others, filed suit against respondent state board of accountancy seeking declaratory relief that respondent could not enjoin appellants from using the terms &quot;accountant&quot; or &quot;accounting&quot; when referring to themselves or their businesses, and for a permanent injunction ordering respondent to cease all enforcement action against the use of those terms. The trial court denied relief to appellants and granted respondent's request for a permanent injunction, and the lower appellate court affirmed. Affirming the lower appellate court's judgment, the court concluded that the adoption and enforcement of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5058 was a proper exercise of respondent's authority to administer the Accountancy Act. The court further concluded that the regulatory scheme could constitutionally ban only those uses of the terms &quot;accountant&quot; and &quot;accounting&quot; that might potentially mislead the public regarding the user's licensee status. However, where the terms were used in conjunction with a modifier or modifiers that serve to dispel any possibility of confusion, their use in such a context could not be constitutionally enjoined.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received the death penalty, and his appeal was automatic. Defendant challenged his conviction of attempted oral copulation based on sufficiency of evidence. The court reversed defendant's conviction for attempted oral copulation, but otherwise affirmed the judgment, finding that the evidence, which was independently admissible as relevant to the question of defendant's guilt for the other charged crimes, was not sufficient to support the verdict on the count of attempted oral copulation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Franchise Tax Board challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), and affirmed by the Court of Appeal that held that California's formula apportionment method of taxation was unconstitutional as applied to foreign-based unitary groups.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent taxpayers brought a refund action to recover assessments levied against them by appellant Franchise Tax Board for the 1977 tax year. The assessments were based on a finding that, together with respondents' United Kingdom-based corporate parent and worldwide subsidiaries, respondents comprised a unitary enterprise subjecting it to appellant's three-factor mathematical formula to apportion the interjurisdictional income of a unitary business for state corporate income tax purposes. The appellate court and the trial court held that the formula apportionment method violated the foreign commerce clause and was unconstitutional as applied to foreign-based unitary groups. The court concluded that, although executive officials had repeatedly attempted to prohibit formula apportionment, the United States Congress had repeatedly refused to do so. The court held that there was a clear federal intent not to prohibit the states from employing formula apportionment in taxing multinational businesses. The court held that the question as to whether formula apportionment violated the due process clause was a factual question to be determined by the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and concluded the employing of formula apportionment by the state in taxing the income of multinational unitary businesses did not violate the foreign commerce clause. The court remanded to the appellate court to determine if the cost of producing the required financial data for formula apportionment violated respondent taxpayers' due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court dismissed the manufacturer's evidentiary and instructional claims and entered a modified judgment. On further appeal, Cal. Civ.

The court held that the statute stated or implied no exception for third party suits by injured employees. The court concluded that the plain language of &sect; 1431.2 eliminated a third-party defendant's joint and several liability to an injured employee for unpaid noneconomic damages attributable to the fault of the employer, who was statutorily immune from suit.

The court of appeal reversed, and appellants challenged the reversal. On appeal, the court held that, even if collateral estoppel applied, the case was within the public interest exception. If estoppel were allowed to bar the action, the constitutionality of the statute would never again be litigated. The court held that the guarantee required that educational activities be free. School transportation was a noneducational activity, so the statute did not violate the guarantee. The statute did not violate the equal protection clause, Cal. Const. art.

The fact that one defendant sued his attorney during trial did not automatically create a conflict of interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which convicted him of first-degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 189, 187; attempted murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 664/187; and robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211 and sentenced him to death. The jury found that the murder was committed under the special circumstance of murder in the commission of robbery, and that defendant had personally used a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lured two former coworkers to a deserted area to rob them. After taking their money, he shot them both, killing one. Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and robbery and was sentenced to death. Appellant challenged the judgment on several grounds. He alleged that he committed the crime under the influence of drugs and that he had not planned the murder. He also contended that the trial court expressed a doubt as to his sanity, but did not hold a hearing to determine his competence. Further, he alleged that the jury selection process was defective, thereby constitutionally invalid. The court affirmed, finding that the record did not show that the judge expressed a doubt as to appellant's competence, but merely indicated that experts should be appointed. Further, the court found that intoxication was not a defense. The court found that the jury selection process was conducted so as to protect the right to a randomly selected jury. Finally, the court ruled that the trial court properly conducted a Hovey voir dire, and appellant's absence during some stages of jury selection was not reversible error where he had waived his right to be present.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder, attempted murder, and robbery were affirmed. The court held that the evidence showed premeditation, that intoxication was not a defense, that there were aggravating circumstances and no overriding mitigating circumstances, that the jury selection process resulted in a random jury, and that the trial court properly conducted a Hovey voir dire.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion to suppress and the appellate court affirmed. The state challenged these ruling and, on appeal, the Supreme Court of California reversed. That court held that Cal.

The court, however, had no reason to see defendant's acts as the result of mental incompetence. The court found that the trial court's refusal to change venue was not an error, and if it was an error it was not prejudicial. The court found that defendant's argument that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a continuance was not an error because defendant did not show good cause for a continuance. The trial court did not abuse its discretion during jury voir dire. The court reversed defendant's conviction on attempted murder and mayhem because the trial court gave an erroneous aiding and abetting instruction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, father of a child born out of wedlock, sought custody of his child. The trial court awarded temporary custody of the child to its mother and ordered the mother to live with the child in a shelter for unwed mothers. The trial court ruled that petitioner was not a presumed father within the meaning of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7004(a)(4). The trial court found by a bare preponderance of the evidence that the child's best interest required termination of petitioner's parental rights. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment. On appeal, the court recognized that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7004(a)(4) did not provide petitioner presumed father status based on his unsuccessful attempts to obtain custody over the mother's objection. The court reversed judgment, however, holding that &sect; 7004(a) violated petitioner's equal protection and due process rights to the extent that it allowed a mother unilaterally to preclude her child's biological father from becoming a presumed father and thereby allowed the state to terminate his parental rights on nothing more than a showing of the child's best interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff transit district sought review of the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, which declared unconstitutional a special benefit assessment district voting scheme that premised its franchise on realty ownership and allotted votes based on the assessed value of the realty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff transit district filed suit to validate a special benefit assessment district voting scheme that premised the right to vote in the underlying referendum election upon realty ownership and allotted votes based on the assessed realty value. Defendants, transit district secretary and intervenors, asserted that the scheme violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV equal protection guarantees. Defendants failed in the trial court and appealed. The appellate court held that the voting scheme contravened the constitutional &quot;one person, one vote&quot; rule. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the voting scheme did not require &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; analysis for two reasons. First, the benefit districts lacked indicia of &quot;general governmental powers&quot; and were therefore special-purpose governmental units exempt from the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; rule. Second, the class that the scheme enfranchised was &quot;primarily affected&quot; by or &quot;primarily interested&quot; in the election, while those excluded were in fact substantially less affected or interested. The enfranchisement and vote allocation rules passed &quot;rational basis&quot; review because a state of facts reasonably could be conceived to justify them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that plaintiff transit district's special benefit assessment district voting scheme violated the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; rule because plaintiff was a special-purpose governmental unit exempt from the rule and the scheme permissibly enfranchised those who were primarily affected by or interested in the underlying election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner governor requested a writ to resolve an impasse created by the failure of petitioner, respondent secretary of state, and real parties in interest California legislature, to adopt congressional, legislative, and State Board of Equalization reapportionment plans in time for the 1992 primary and general elections. The court exercised its original jurisdiction, issued an alternative writ, and appointed masters who submitted a report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner governor sought a writ of mandate to order apportionment of districts by respondent secretary of state and real parties in interest California legislature before the 1992 primary and general elections. The court ordered three masters to prepare a reapportionment plan because it lacked assurance that the plan would have been validly enacted in time for the 1992 elections. The court approved the masters' report and recommendations and denied the petition for a writ of mandate. The court found that each legislative and congressional district varied by less than one percent and 0.25 percent, respectively, from &quot;ideal&quot; population equality, and that these minor deviations were justified by legitimate state objectives of forming reasonably compact districts, which was part of the 1973 reapportionment criteria outlined by the court in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1971 et seq. The court held that the VRA authorized deliberate construction of minority controlled voting districts, thereby approving a new district with a combined minority population in excess of 85 percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adopted the masters' reapportionment plans with minor modifications because the lines drawn in the plan adhered to the legal criteria under federal and state law. The court did not have reason to believe that petitioner governor, respondent secretary of state, and real parties interest California legislature, would not adhere to its holding, so it denied the petition for a writ of mandate and discharged the alternative writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder, rape, attempted rape, and robbery of one of the victims. Defendant's sentence was enhanced because the jury found he used a firearm to commit the crimes. Because defendant was condemned to death, an appeal automatically ensued. The court affirmed the sentence adjudged but took action on defendant's rape and robbery convictions. The court reduced the rape conviction to attempted rape because the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it was legally possible for defendant to rape a dead body, an error that the court concluded was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed defendant's robbery conviction, its related firearm-use enhancement, and the robbery special circumstance because the trial court did not instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of theft despite evidence defendant formed his intent to steal after the death of the victim. The court found that the presence of after-formed intent evidence imposed on the trial court a sua sponte duty to instruct on theft as a lesser included offense. Errors of instruction and argument on defendant's other crimes were harmless.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to recuse the prosecutor for a conflict of interest. Defendant alleged that the prosecutor's wife and the victim were acquaintances. For a motion to recuse to be granted, the conflict of interest had to be of such gravity that it was unlikely defendant would receive a fair trial unless recusal was ordered. The trial court correctly found no personal interests in the case that would create the likelihood of an unfair trial. Therefore, the motion was properly denied. Defendant also alleged that the jury venire did not represent a fair cross-section of the community. Defendant failed to prove a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement because he did not show that the underrepresentation of a distinctive group was due to systematic exclusion in the jury-selection process.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment in its entirety. Exigent circumstances justified defendant's warrantless arrest. Defendant's mistaken belief he was acting under duress did not establish an imperfect duress defense to robbery. The mistake failed to negate the specific intent element.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On automatic appeal, defendant sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which sentenced him to death under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence on two counts of first degree murder. The court set aside one multiple-murder special-circumstance finding under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190 et seq., because one case could only support one such finding as a matter of law. The court set aside both intentional-murder-for-financial-gain special-circumstance findings because the deaths were not consideration for or prerequisites to financial gain. Defendant fled to Tokyo after the murders. On his return flight to the United States and during a layover in Honolulu, defendant made certain admissions to the law enforcement officers accompanying him. The court found that the inflight and Honolulu admissions were voluntary under U.S. Const. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 7, 15, and Miranda because the officers did not intend to &quot;soften&quot; him up, there was no custodial interrogation on the flight, there was no coercive activity by the state, there was no violation of the Edwards rule, and defendant waived his Miranda rights in Honolulu. Defendant's letters to his wife were not privileged because he believed that the authorities were reading his mail and had no privacy expectations.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the ballot was constitutional, and did not violate any federal constitutional right of access to the ballot or U.S. Const. amend. I. The court also stated that the ballot did not interfere with the legislative branch, or amount to a bill of attainder.

Although the self-incrimination privilege under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 was much broader, the court determined that Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 30(c) provided a limitation to the privilege.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried by jury in the Los Angeles County Superior Court (California) and found guilty of murder and robbery, with the special circumstances and a prior murder conviction, and was sentenced to death. Defendant sought a writ of habeas corpus or a summary reversal because his trial was presided over by a commissioner, without his or his counsel's written authorization, in violation of Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and robbery, with special circumstances and a previous murder conviction, and was sentenced to death. A court commissioner conducted the trial, although defendant had never been informed by either the commissioner or his counsel that he had a right to be tried by a superior court judge. At a pre-trial hearing, the commissioner gave a stipulation to counsel for defendant's signature and consent to trial by the commissioner. In the absence of an objection by counsel and defendant, the commissioner assumed that the stipulation had been signed and presided over the trial. The court held that, while Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 21 required a stipulation for the court commissioner to sit as a temporary judge, a tantamount stipulation arose because counsel was vested with the general authority to control the procedural aspects of the litigation, counsel did so, and bound defendant by his conduct. The court held that nothing in Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 21vested defendant with the sole authority to decide whether to stipulate to trial by commissioner because waiver of trial by a regular superior court judge was not a fundamental, personal right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court discharged the order to show cause and denied defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus because defendant's right to waive a trial with a judge was not a fundamental, personal one, which required an admonition and express waiver. The court held that the stipulation necessary to vest the commissioner with the authority to try the case was inferred from the conduct of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insanity acquittee sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeal (California) that reversed the trial court's denial of appellant's request for a jury trial and application for placement in a community mental health program as a supervised outpatient under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026.2(e); and remanded the case for a jury trial. The issue before the court was whether appellant was entitled to a jury trial at the first-stage hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who had been found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a state hospital, after he shot and tried to kill six people, requested a jury trial on the issue of his eligibility for placement in a community mental health program as a supervised outpatient pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1026.2(e). The trial court did not empanel a jury, and denied his application. The court of appeals reversed and remanded the case for a jury trial. The court reversed the court of appeals decision. It found that the relevant statute did not purport to give a committed person the right to a jury at the hearing on outpatient placement. The court held that because criminal and civil committees enjoyed the right to jury trials at the same stages of the commitment process, equal protection was not offended. Further, the court found no support for the conclusion that it violated due process for a judge to consider an insanity acquittee's application as insanity acquittees already enjoyed substantial procedural safeguards at placement hearings, and the additions of juries would be more expensive and burdensome without making their outcomes more reliable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals, holding that appellant insanity acquittee was not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of his eligibility for placement in a community mental health program as a supervised outpatient because the relevant statute did not expressly provide for a jury in a placement hearing, and having a judge consider appellant's application did not offend equal protection or violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner savings bank challenged the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, which held that respondent city's license tax on petitioner fell within the municipal affairs of respondent and was therefore authorized by Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5(a). Petitioner sought a refund of this tax on the basis that Cal.  Rev. &amp; Tax.  &sect; 23182 provided for a state tax of petitioner, which was in lieu of all other taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Beginning in 1981, Cal.  Rev. &amp; Tax.  &sect; 23182 provided for a unitary state income tax on financial corporations, including petitioner savings bank. Though &sect; 23182 provided that the tax was in lieu of all other taxes, except for the initial year, respondent city continued to impose its annual business license tax on petitioner. Petitioner paid the tax under protest, and subsequently filed a lawsuit to obtain a refund of the tax on the basis that it was prohibited by &sect; 23182. Respondent argued that the tax was a municipal affair, and thus protected under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5(a). In reversing the judgment of the lower court, the court found that in cases of conflict between a state statute and a charter city measure, where the state can demonstrate a true area of statewide concern, the charter measure ceases to be a municipal affair, and thus was not protected under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5(a). Given the similarity between commercial banks and savings banks, and the almost exclusive regulation of savings banks by either federal or state governments, this court concluded that this was an area of statewide concern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, finding that there was a legitimate interest in assessing a unified, standard state tax on banks and financial corporations. Because this taxation was a matter of statewide concern, respondent city's tax ceased to be a municipal affair, and thus was not protected by the home rule provision of the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of six counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the convictions, first concluding that the testimony of an accomplice was properly admitted as there was no indication that her plea agreement was unduly coercive. The jury instructions regarding accomplice testimony were proper as they allowed the jury to consider all circumstances relevant to the accomplices' credibility. Further, the trial court did not err by limiting the cross-examination of an accomplice, because counsel sought to raise irrelevant matters and otherwise questioned her at length. The murder counts were properly joined as the evidence was largely cross-admissible, all charges involved the death penalty, and the evidence was strong on each charge. Other crimes evidence was properly admitted, defendant's confrontation and Miranda rights were not violated, and defendant's motion to change venue was properly denied. The court affirmed the sentence, concluding that no prejudicial errors were made during the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The court vacated one special circumstance, but affirmed the judgment. The court found that defendant's rights to retain counsel of his own choosing and to make the fundamental decisions of his defense were not violated. The trial court did not err in allowing conflicting defenses or in discussing matters outside of defendant's presence. Because defendant was represented by counsel, the trial court had no duty to warn of the dangers of self-representation. The trial court did not err in giving the flight instruction or by not reiterating the mental condition instruction. The jury could not have been misled about the scope of its sentencing discretion. Although it was error to include an extra special circumstance, there was no reasonable possibility that the error affected the verdict. Counsel was not ineffective during the penalty stage. Other assaults, for which the statute of limitations had run, were admissible. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for a competency hearing and expert testimony. The penalty was not disproportionate to either the offenses or defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the lower court and held that religious invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies were constitutionally impermissible because they failed both the effect and the entanglement tests of the U.S. Const. amend. I establishment clause. Because the ceremonies were organized and controlled by the government to celebrate a significant event, words spoken as part of the ceremonies inevitably created a strong appearance of government endorsement. The assertedly &quot;nonsectarian&quot; nature of the prayers did not render their government sponsorship constitutionally acceptable. In addition, the practice of including prayers at public high school graduation ceremonies impermissibly entangled government in religious matters because it involved governmental selection of religious speakers and approval of the content of prayer. Finally, the practice of graduation prayer also violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 and art. XVI, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and held that religious invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies were constitutionally impermissible because they failed both the effect and the entanglement tests of the U.S. Const. amend. I establishment clause and the corresponding state constitutional provisions. The prayer created an appearance of government endorsement and involved governmental selection and approval of prayer content.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case was before the court for the third time. In previous decisions, the court reversed appellant's conviction because of ineffective counsel and errors in certain special circumstances findings for purposes of capital punishment. On this third appeal, the convictions and death penalty sentence were affirmed. Here, appellant raised numerous arguments, including that the court erred by denying him co-counsel status, not granting him substitute counsel, and denying his eve-of-trial motion to represent himself. The court held that, because appellant was represented by adequate counsel, he had no automatic right to join as co-counsel. In fact, the trial court's discretion to allow such an arrangement was sharply limited and could only be exercised upon a substantial showing that it would promote justice and judicial efficiency. The court found no such showing here. The court also found that the trial court did not err by denying appellant's demand to substitute himself as counsel on the eve of trial in that, under such circumstances, the trial court's denial was within its discretion. Accordingly, the judgment below was affirmed in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, as his counsel's actions were not deficient, and no prejudice resulted as the result would have been the same in any case. The court further stated that voir dire was properly conducted, as the prosecution did not improperly select a pro-death jury, or that the selection of the jury violated his constitutional rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder under the special circumstances of concurrent conviction of multiple murders under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(3) and witness killing under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(10). On appeal, defendant claimed numerous errors. The court rejected the contention that the jury should have been instructed on defendant's honest belief in imminent peril as negating malice because the court gave other instructions concerning the effects of threats on the requisite mental state. An admission of a homicide that was illegally obtained by police in another state was properly admitted because defendant's admitted the crime freely under circumstances sufficiently attenuated from the earlier illegality as to dissipate the primary taint. The evidence was insufficient to support the witness-killing special circumstance findings because the two murders were part of the same continuous criminal transaction against both victims. Lastly, the finding of two multiple-murder special circumstances was erroneous. Accordingly, the court affirmed but set aside one multiple-murder special circumstance and both witness-killing special circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court for review was a recommendation from the Review Department of the State Bar Court (California) that petitioner attorney be disbarred for numerous counts of client-related misconduct. Petitioner claimed that state bar lacked jurisdiction and that the disciplinary proceedings were void under the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1961 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney sought review of a recommendation from the Review Department of the State Bar Court (Department) that petitioner attorney be disbarred. Petitioner was found culpable in nine counts of misconduct involving forty separate acts of such misconduct as commingling client funds, concealing assets, engaging in disruptive and offensive courtroom-conduct, and making frivolous motions to disqualify judges. The court adopted the Department's recommendation and ordered petitioner's disbarment. The court rejected petitioner's claims that the disciplinary proceedings violated Sherman Anti-Trust Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1961 et seq. The court ruled that the Act was inapplicable to the state disciplinary action and that there was no persuasive evidence of any racketeering activity on the part of the state bar in disciplining her. The court rejected as meritless petitioner's claim that discipline imposed by the integrated bar was an unconstitutional violation of associational or free speech rights.</SPAN></P>

The federal Sherman Antitrust Act was inapplicable to the state's disciplinary action; there was no persuasive evidence of any racketeering activity on the part of the state bar in disciplining her. There was no constitutional infirmity regarding the establishment of or procedures used by the state bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal combined with a petition for habeas corpus relief, defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California), which convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death in the murder and sexual mutilation of a 5-month-old infant girl. The state supreme court issued an order to show cause in the habeas corpus petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole his uncle's pickup truck and drove to an out of state bar, where he agreed to go with a woman to collect her children, a 5-year-old boy and 5-month-old girl. While defendant and the woman were in another bar, the boy found defendant's gun and pointed it at a passer-by, who took the gun away. The mother went to report the theft, and defendant drove away, dropping the boy off. The infant was later found sexually mutilated and dead. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant asserted numerous errors, including that his intoxication was a defense and that his conviction was improperly based on the testimony of cellmate informants. While reversing the jury's finding as to a torture-murder special circumstance for lack of proof of intent to torture, the state supreme court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that a diminished capacity instruction was proper only when substantial evidence of such capacity negated the requisite criminal intent. Moreover, the supreme court held that there was no U.S. Const. amend. VI violation because defendant's cellmates were merely passive listening posts, not government agents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order to show cause was discharged, and the habeas corpus petition was denied. The state supreme court reversed the lower court's finding as to the torture-murder special circumstance because there was no basis for finding that defendant intended to torture his victim, but the court affirmed the lower court's judgment and penalty, holding that the invalidation of one of several aggravating factors did not warrant reversal of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals rejected appellant's constitutional challenges to &sect; 19996.2(a). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals because respondent was not prejudiced by respondent's failure to give him prior notice or an opportunity to respond since he was not working when he was terminated and he suffered no damages. The court held that appellant was entitled to due process because &sect; 19996.2(a) was not self-executing since respondent had to make a factual determination as to whether appellant resigned. The court held that because the factual determinations made under &sect; 19996.2(a) were relatively simple, due process merely required respondent to give appellant written notice that his termination was being considered and an opportunity to present his version of the facts before a neutral fact finder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), of the murders of five victims, each in the first degree, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of murdering four elderly victims, and he also strangled a fellow inmate in jail while awaiting trial. Defendant confessed to the murders of the four, but then recanted at trial. The court affirmed the convictions and sentence of death because it found no prejudice to defendant in consolidation of the charges in one trial where none of the murder counts were stronger or more inflammatory than the others. The prosecutor properly explained his peremptory challenges to negate a case of group bias. Defendant's proposed voir dire questions were improper and the trial court was within its discretion to deny the questions. The allowance of evidence of flight to show consciousness of guilt and the jury instruction on flight were not an abuse of discretion where the facts clearly supported it. The probative value of the photographs admitted outweighed the prejudicial effect. Improper questions by the prosecutor did not make it reasonably probable that a trial without them would have resulted in a verdict more favorable to defendant. The jury charge on mitigation allowed consideration of evidence not associated with the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court struck all but one multiple-murder special-circumstance findings, and affirmed the conviction and sentence. Defendant did not demonstrate prejudice based on consolidation, jury voir dire and selection, allowance of evidence of flight, admission of unpleasant photographs, improper questions by the prosecutor or alleged improper jury instructions because the evidence of guilt was overwhelmingly strong against him on every count.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;For the foregoing reasons, we order that petitioner Anna Lou Kelley be publicly reproved and placed on disciplinary probation for three years subject to all the conditions set forth by the review department in its recommendation, with the exception of the requirement that petitioner abstain from the use of intoxicants during such period.  This order is effective upon finality of this decision in this court.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 953(a).) <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney challenged the recommendation of the Review Department of the State Bar Court (California) to the effect that petitioner be publicly reproved and placed on disciplinary probation for three years on several conditions, including abstinence from the use of intoxicants and referral to the State Bar Program on Alcohol Abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At petitioner attorney's initial conviction of driving with a blood-alcohol level in excess of the legal limit, she was given 36 months probation. Before the probationary period expired, petitioner was again convicted of driving with a blood-alcohol level in excess of the legal limit. Following an administrative hearing, the Review Department of the State Bar Court recommended that petitioner be publicly reproved and placed on disciplinary probation for three years, with the condition that she not use intoxicants during this period, and that she enroll in the Bar's program on alcohol abuse. The court accepted the recommendation, rejecting petitioner's claim that the &quot;other misconduct&quot; basis used to discipline attorneys who were not engaged in activities involving moral turpitude or that directly related to the practice of law, was unconstitutionally vague. Though petitioner's activity did not involve the practice of law there was a nexus between it and her fitness to practice law. The court also found that, except for the requirement that petitioner not use intoxicants during the probationary period, the discipline imposed was appropriate to the nature and extent of the misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted the recommendation of the Review Department of the State Bar Court, finding that the other misconduct basis used to discipline petitioner attorney was not constitutionally vague, that the conduct was related to petitioner's fitness to practice law, and that except for the prohibition on petitioner's use of intoxicants for a three year period, which the court found overbroad, the discipline was suited to the misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus for review of the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which was consolidated with the automatic appeal of the judgment of death imposed after his conviction for committing lewd and lascivious acts, oral copulation and first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial for first degree murder, committing lewd and lascivious acts on an individual under 14, and oral copulation, the prosecution introduced expert evidence linking defendant's leg injuries with those that would occur from a struggle between defendant and his alleged victim. Defendant's expert testified that the injuries pre-dated the alleged crimes. In rebuttal, the prosecution provided the testimony of the arresting officers and a statement of defendant after his arrest that his injuries occurred on the night of the alleged incident while he was elsewhere. Because there was also evidence that defendant had not been at the location he claimed, the court ruled that it was not error to admit this rebuttal evidence. Many of the errors claimed by defendant on appeal were not challenged at trial, and thus the court ruled that they had been waived. The reference to prior felony convictions under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.3 included felony convictions of other states. Though the court erroneously admitted prior charges against defendant of a nonviolent crime, this was not reversible error because there was no reasonable possibility that it effected the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and denied defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court ruled that many of the defendant's claims had no merit, and those that had merit either were waived because they had not been raised at trial, or there was no reasonable probability that their absence would have affected the outcome of the trial, and thus were not grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Barbara County (California), which sentenced defendant to death for multiple first-degree murders under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 and lewd or lascivious acts with a child under the age of 14 under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(a) after finding special circumstances of multiple murder, witness-killing, and felony murder under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to six counts of lewd or lascivious act with a child under the age of 14 under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(a) and three counts of murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187. Defendant admitted prior offenses under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 667(b), 667.5(c)(6), 1203.066(a)(5). A jury found the murders to be of the first degree and found true the special circumstances of multiple murder, witness-killing, and felony murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 190.2(a)(3), 190.2(a)(10), 190.2(a)(17)(v). Defendant was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court set aside the witness-killing special circumstance because the crime witnessed was not prior to or separate from the witness-killing but part of the same continuous criminal transaction. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment finding that defendant's confessions were voluntary and not the result of coercion or promised benefit, that autopsy photographs were valid given their probative value as to material and disputed issues, that evidence of prior felonies was relevant to the material issue of criminal activity, and that the meaning communicated by the jury instructions was not objectionable under the reasonable juror test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and sentence of defendant in all respects except as to the witness-killing special circumstance, which the court set aside because the crime witnessed was separate from the witness-killing, but rather an integral part of the same continuous criminal transaction. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment and the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's automatic appeal followed the sentence of death imposed upon him by the Superior Court of Contra Costa County (California), after his conviction by jury of three counts of rape, robbery in an inhabited dwelling, attempted rape, and three counts of burglary. The jury also found three prior conviction enhancements were true: murder while the defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted commission of robbery and burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous errors in his appeal of his death sentence, murder, and felony convictions. In affirming the lower court judgment, the court found that with respect to defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant failed to show either that his counsel's actions fell below the reasonable standard imposed or having proved that, failed to show that a more favorable determination would have been reached but for this error. Since both elements were needed to prevail on this claim, it was rejected. Similarly, though the court found error with respect to some matters at trial, it ruled that there was no reasonable possibility that this error effected the outcome of the trial, and thus it was not grounds for reversal. The court also found that the prosecutor was allowed to argue the lack of mitigating factors during closing argument at the penalty phase. Further, there was no legal requirement that the jury return a unanimous verdict on each aggravating circumstance which it found during the penalty phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, finding no error in many of defendant's claims; and in those cases where the court found error, it also found that there was no reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a more favorable verdict in the absence of such error. The court also found no error in the instructions given to the jury during the penalty phase or in the argument made by the prosecutor during this phase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, in an automatic appeal pursuant to Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, rape, attempted robbery, and burglary of an elderly neighbor. The trial court found true enhancement allegations for use of a deadly weapon, infliction of injury upon a victim of advanced age, and commission of offenses while on parole for a violent felony, and found special circumstances for felony-murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17). The jury gave a penalty of death, and defendant was granted an automatic appeal under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1239(b). On rehearing, the court affirmed the judgment in its entirety. The court found no ineffective assistance of counsel even though counsel had never tried a capital case. Moreover, the court found that defendant never requested substitution of counsel, appointment of a second attorney, or self-representation. The court further found that any errors that occurred in the guilt or penalty phase were harmless, nonconstitutional, and non-prejudicial. Because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, including a confession and defendant's prior violent conduct, the results in both phases of the trial would have been the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, taxpayers and voters, challenged the validity of Proposition 115, claiming that its broad diversity embraced multiple subjects, violating the &quot;single subject&quot; rule of Cal.

Petitioners sought an appellate court issuance of an original writ of mandate or prohibition against respondents, public officials and courts, who were responsible for implementing the initiative. However, the suit was transferred and the court exercised original jurisdiction, holding that respondents should refrain from enforcing &sect; 3 of Proposition 115, because it contemplated such a far-reaching change in the state's governmental framework as to amount to a qualitative constitutional revision. Section 3 would have vested all judicial interpretive power, as to fundamental criminal defense rights, in the United States Supreme Court. Being severable from &sect; 3, the remaining initiative sections could be given effect, because all parts were reasonably germane to each other and to the general purpose of promoting the rights of crime victims.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court erred by, among other claimed errors, allowing him to represent himself, in denying his motions for separate guilt/penalty, by admitting jailhouse recordings, by admitting evidence of other crimes, by allowing his wife to testify against him, by admitting blood type, by improperly instructing the jury, by permitting prosecutorial misconduct, by allowing the prosecutor to improperly excuse jurors, and by permitting appellant to be represented ineffectively. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's conviction but set aside one multiple-murder special circumstance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder with a prior-murder special circumstance. Defendant sought to strike the special circumstance because he was under the influence of drugs when he pled guilty to the prior murder and was not advised of his constitutional rights. Respondent court held an evidentiary hearing and denied defendant's motion. The appellate court denied defendant's petition for writ of mandate. The court affirmed, finding that the appellate court had properly denied the writ, but for the wrong reasons. The court held that the governing statutes did not require that the jury hear a constitutional attack on a prior murder conviction. Under Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 190.1, the jury was to determine the truth of the special circumstance, but the trial court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing prior to trial to determine the constitutionality of the challenged conviction. Defendant had to prove the constitutional invalidity of the prior conviction by a preponderance of the evidence. The prior judgment carried a presumption of regularity. The testimony of the interested parties during the evidentiary hearing supported respondent's finding of validity.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed because the warrant was valid and the testimony of a jailhouse informant was properly admitted to show that defendant was aware that the victims were peace officers executing a search warrant. The court held that when criminal statutes accorded special treatment to violence against peace officers engaged in duties, such duties included service of facially valid warrants, regardless of the legal sufficiency of the facts supporting the warrant. The court denied defendant's habeas corpus petition because he received effective assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff seller brought suit against defendant buyer to recover an unpaid balance on a contract for sewer pipe. A lower court found for plaintiff and awarded prejudgment interest at 18 percent per year.

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that interest payments on overdue commercial accounts were not subject to the usury law. The court determined that the parties' transaction was exempt from the usury laws because it was a credit sale. The court applied the principle that a transaction that was not usurious at its inception could not become usurious by virtue of a debtor's voluntary default. The court found that the late charges were a part of the contract under Cal. Com. Code &sect; 2207. The court concluded that the late charge provided in the contract was not subject to the usury law because it did not constitute payment for the loan or the forbearance of any money. Additionally, it was exempt from the usury law under the time-price doctrine and the principle that a debtor by voluntary act could not render an otherwise valid contract usurious.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners moved for a writ of mandate that sought an order compelling respondent to enforce the provisions of petitioner's measure. The appellate court determined that the measures invalidated by respondent should be enforced. Respondent sought review. The court reversed and remanded with directions to deny the petition for writ of mandate, noting that Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 10(b) stated that if provisions of two or more measures were approved at the same general election conflict, those of the measure receiving the highest affirmative vote would prevail.

The court set aside the special circumstance findings based on the commission of a burglary and the conclusion that the murder was heinous, atrocious, and cruel, because the findings were constitutionally infirm. However, the court otherwise affirmed the judgment in its entirety because defendant did not demonstrate the race neutral procedures used to assemble the master jury list were constitutionally impermissible. Also, there was sufficient evidence of defendant's guilt based on eyewitnesses' identification, and the physical evidence linked him to the crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but the special circumstance finding that murder was based on the commission of a burglary was set aside because burglary based on intent to assault did not support a felony-murder jury instruction. Also, the special circumstance finding that murder was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel was unconstitutionally vague. However, the death penalty was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged his convictions on the grounds that he was entitled to a new trial based on juror misconduct, and that the question of whether appellant's misstatements and omissions were material should have been determined by the jury. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that in a perjury prosecution based on errors or omissions in disclosure statements, materiality is an element of the offense, and must therefore be determined by the jury. Thus, the court held that the trial court's instruction completely deprived the jury of an opportunity to consider the materiality of appellant's omissions and that constituted reversible error. Additionally, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing at which jurors could be subpoenaed to testify as to jury misconduct. The court held that permitting jurors to testify at evidentiary hearings is consistent with procedures at other stages of criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Two indigent residents intervened on behalf of the city. The trial court granted judgment in favor of respondents and appellants challenged. The court affirmed, holding that the approved ballot measures complied with the constitutional requirements and that respondent city was not compelled to secure further voter authorization before proceeding with the low-income housing proposal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A courier for an armored-car service was robbed and murdered in a department store after he picked up the store's receipts for bank deposit. Evidence indicated that defendant and his brothers conspired to commit the crimes, that the brothers shot the courier, and that defendant drove the getaway car. Defendant and his brothers were charged with robbery and conspiracy to commit murder. A felony-murder-robbery special circumstance was alleged against defendant and his brothers, and personal use of a firearm was alleged against the brothers. Defendant was tried separately. The jury found defendant guilty as charged, determined that the special circumstance was true, and fixed the penalty at death. On automatic appeal, the court affirmed. The court found, among other things, that the superior court did not err in admitting evidence of a similar prior robbery and murder. An extrajudicial identification admitted at trial was not so unreliable as to violate defendant's right to due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant did not meet his burden to make a sufficient showing that an unnamed informant had information material to defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellant had failed to demonstrate that the settlement was not in good faith.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction on multiple murder counts and his sentence of death.

The court held that the exclusion of jurors who would not vote for the death penalty did not violate defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI, and that there was no violation of rights under U.S. Const. amend. VIII where there was no intercase proportionality review. Further, defendant had waived his complaints regarding references to his failure to submit to cross-examination, by having failed to raise that objection at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered a woman and was found guilty and sentenced to death. On automatic appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's confessions and waivers were valid as voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. The prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to exclude certain jurors was proper and his comments regarding the victim's family, although improper, did not require reversal. The trial court's instruction on penalty factors was not appealable due to the doctrine of invited error. The jury instruction on penalty determination did not mislead the jury as to its discretion in imposing the death penalty, nor was the failure to instruct on the burden of proof as to aggravating circumstances an error. The trial court's response to a jury request to define terms, while not perfect, was acceptable. The trial court's findings on individual and intracase proportionality were proper and it was correct in refusing to perform an intercase proportionality review. The court then denied defendant's habeas corpus petition, as defendant had effective assistance of counsel and although defendant sufficiently alleged juror misconduct, the presumption of prejudice was rebutted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real parties in interest reporters challenged the decision of the California Court of Appeals, which granted the request of petitioners, defendant and the State, to vacate respondent superior court's orders granting the reporters' petitions for writs of habeas corpus. The reporters claimed immunity from contempt under the shield law, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2(b), for their refusal to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the term &quot;unpublished information&quot; in the state newsperson's shield law, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2(b), included a newsperson's nonconfidential, eyewitness observations of an occurrence in a public place and, if so, whether a newsperson could nevertheless be held in contempt for refusing to disclose such information in a criminal proceeding. Defendant was charged in a misdemeanor complaint with possession of brass knuckles in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12020(a). Defendant sought testimony from reporters who witnessed his search and arrest, contending that he had not consented to the search by police officers. The reporters refused to testify and were found in contempt. They filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus, which were granted by the superior court. Agreeing with the Court of Appeals, the court held that the reporters' protection under the shield law had to yield to defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial when the reporters' refusal to disclose information would unduly infringe on that right. The superior court accordingly erred by granting the reporters' petitions for writs of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Court of Appeals' judgment and directed the Court of Appeals to issue a peremptory writ of mandate compelling the superior court to vacate its orders granting that granted the reporters' petitions and simultaneously issue new orders denying the petitions for writs of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the rape of his former wife, first degree murder of his social worker's husband, attempted second degree murder of his social worker and her daughter, and arson of the social worker's home. The court rejected almost all of defendant's challenges to the convictions and sentences. The court held that the trial court erred when it applied the delivery of explosives special circumstance of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(6) that rendered the death penalty applicable to defendant's first degree murder charge. Since gasoline was not an explosive and it was not delivered, the gasoline fire caused by defendant was not within the meaning of &sect; 190.2(a)(6). Also, since the purpose of defendant's arson was for killing the victim, the court held that the trial court committed harmless error when it refused to instruct the jury that before the arson special circumstance of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(viii) could be found true, the jury had to find that defendant had an independent felonious purpose for the commission of arson. Also, the court held that since defendant ignited fires in the victim's home, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654 required the arson term to be stayed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as modified by the court. The court found merit in defendant's assertion that a delivery-of-explosives special aggravating circumstance was inapplicable because defendant's conduct was not within the meaning of the statute that imposed it. The court also held that one determinate term for arson had to be stayed because the crimes were committed by the act of igniting fires in the victim's home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to invalidate ordinance enacted by defendant city on grounds it was unconstitutional on its face. Ordinance was enacted to amend existing rent control ordinance. Plaintiffs contended that enactment of the ordinance resulted in a regulatory taking of their property, without just compensation in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer on the ground that ordinance was facially constitutional and dismissed the case. The court affirmed, concluding that ordinance on its face was not an unconstitutional regulatory taking. Protection of current mobile homeowners' equity in their homes and protection of prospective mobile homeowners from excessive rents were legitimate government interests, and defendant could have reasonably concluded that limiting plaintiffs' ability to raise rent upon sale or transfer of mobile homes would accomplish that goal by making mobile homes more attractive sale items and making mobile homeownership more feasible for prospective buyers.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was placed on probation and sentence was suspended. Appellant subsequently filed a petition for a certificate of rehabilitation. The trial court denied his request; Cal.

He appealed, arguing that that application violated laws against ex post facto clauses, his constitutional due process rights, and it was inappropriately applied retroactively. The court held that the last act to trigger application of &sect; 4852.13 as amended was the actual filing of the petition in 1997. At that time, existing law provided fair notice of the applicable judicial standard. Thus, &sect; 4852.13 as amended in 1996 was applied prospectively to a petition filed after its effective date.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred by imposing the 25-years-to-life enhancement pursuant to Cal.

Penal Code &sect;&sect; 12022, 12022.7 may not be compared to &sect; 12022.53, because they enhance the sentence for &quot;any felony,&quot; whereas &sect; 12022.53 is limited to designated felonies of a very serious type. More significantly, the legislature determined in enacting &sect; 12022.53 that the use of firearms in commission of the designated felonies is such a danger that substantially longer prison sentences must be imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it set the restitution amount because the evidence demonstrated a rational basis for its determination.

The court, however, reversed on the second argument, holding that CALJIC No. 2.50.01 was constitutionally infirm, because the instruction permitted the jury to find appellant guilty of the current charges solely because he had committed prior sexual offenses, and the court could not assume the jury followed the constitutionally correct conflicting instruction.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that charter schools were public and thus under the jurisdiction of the public school system. In addition, the legislature had plenary power over public schools and broad discretion to determine the types of programs and services which broadened the purposes of education. The Act as amended did not run afoul of the constitutional prohibitions against public appropriations in aid of sectarian purposes or institutions. The Act did not conflict with the textbook adoption requirement of the state constitution or education laws and did not impermissibly delegate legislative powers. The court struck down appellants' challenges to the Act and ruled the Act rested on solid constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged by information with failure to stop at the scene of an accident resulting in injury or death. The information further alleged that, during the commission of the offense, appellant inflicted great bodily injury and that appellant had suffered a 1978 serious felony conviction for murder in Texas. Appellant moved to strike his prior Texas murder conviction on the ground it was obtained in violation of Boykin/Tahl, but trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed, finding there was nothing in the record to indicate that Texas required Tahl-like admonishments when appellant's plea was taken. Allowing defendant to challenge a plea based on an out of state conviction not entered under Tahl-like protections was judicially inefficient and would saddle California trial courts with obligations not required by either the federal or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found for plaintiffs. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed in part, holding Cal. Const. art. XIX was violated because it required fees and taxes imposed on vehicles to be used for transportation purposes, not deposited in the general fund. The fee violated the Commerce Clause because it discriminated between federally-certified and California-certified vehicles and defendants failed to show a legitimate local purpose that could not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.

The trial court dismissed the offender's SVP petition. The people sought a writ of mandate to set aside the dismissal. The court held that neither the action of the people in filing the SVP Act petition nor the decision of the federal government to defer action on the offender's deportation resulted in invidiously discriminatory disparate treatment under the otherwise neutral SVP Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prosecution convicted defendant of two counts of lewd and lascivious acts upon a child. Prosecution presented evidence of defendant's prior sexual misconduct. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No.&sect; 2.50.1, 2.50.01. The constitutional attack against using prior sexual misconduct to prove defendant committed the current offense was rejected. Evidence of uncharged sexual offenses increasing the evidence of defendant's guilt did not reduce prosecution's burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that prior sexual offenses that were collateral circumstances and proved by a preponderance of the evidence could be used to infer that the defendant committed the current sexual offense. Permissive inferences were constitutional because a rational factfinder could make the connection. Based on the jury instructions, prosecution still had the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt and the jury could not convict solely on proof of the other crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction affirmed; the jury instructions did not unconstitutionally lower prosecution's burden of proving current sexual offenses beyond a reasonable doubt because the instructions met constitutional due process requirements and prior sexual offenses did not need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but only by preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle, carjacking, kidnapping, and burglary. Defendant appealed claiming that his conviction for kidnapping during carjacking under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 209.5 was unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant alleged that &sect; 209.5 was unconstitutionally vague. He contended that the trial court erred by giving the jury California Jury Instruction No. 9.54.1, which defined the asportation element of section 209.5 as a substantial distance from the vicinity of the carjacking, a distance more than slight, brief, or trivial. On appeal, the court rejected the defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional and upheld the conviction. The court reasoned that a statute was not void for vagueness where a reasonable and practical construction could be given to its language.</SPAN></P>

The rights at issue were subject to waiver by agreement, and additional factors weighed against recognition of a public policy claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought an action against respondent city and county for declaratory relief, taxpayer's injunctive relief, and ordinary mandamus, contending that respondent city's utility tax was invalid under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53723 (Proposition 62). The statute of limitations period commenced when respondent city's ordinance was enacted in December 1992. It was absurd for appellant to suggest it was forestalled or intimidated by prevailing case law from filing its suit at the time respondent city passed its ordinance. The basis of appellant's complaint was the legality of the ordinance imposing a utility tax without complying with Proposition 62's voter approval requirements of. The legality of that act had to be timely challenged and could not accrue continuously with each month's utility bill.  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 526a did not authorize an injunction to prevent the illegal collection of a tax. The taxpayer's injunctive relief cause of action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a unanimous &quot;special&quot; verdict for the plaintiff, defendant's motions for a new trial and for judgment not withstanding the verdict were denied, and it appealed. The court held that an unbroken line of decisional authority holds that just what constitutes an economic actor's &quot;cost&quot; is an issue of fact to be decided by the trier of fact. In this case, however, the trial court decided the cost issue as a matter of law in circumstances that virtually ensured a verdict for the plaintiff. The court further held that each side pointed to flaws in other's economic model to determine cost, and neither was so strong that it could have banished other. Therefore, both approaches were sufficiently reasonable that both ought to have been put before jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to make payments to plaintiff pursuant to an assignment of royalties from a copyrighted song. In his answer, defendant asserted that, as a matter of federal law, the beginning of a renewal term had revested the copyright in the author and had cut off plaintiff's right to receive royalties. Defendant urged that the presence of this issue invoked exclusive federal copyright jurisdiction. The trial court agreed and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed. Nonpayment of royalties was a contract issue not preempted by federal copyright law, and the states are expressly allowed to regulate activities violating legal or equitable rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright law. Since a case could not be removed to the federal court on the basis of a federal copyright defense, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted defendant's motion to declare that sex offender registration would constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and Cal. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 17. Plaintiff contended that it was not cruel and unusual because defendant was convicted of two felony sex offenses. Defendant was 28 years old, and although did not use physical force, it could not be said that the victim consented to the acts as part of a romantic relationship. The registration requirement did not shock the conscience and offend fundamental notions of human dignity. The classification did not withstand equal protection scrutiny, as Cal. Penal Code &sect;290 required those who engaged in oral copulation with minors under 16 to register as sex offenders, but making no requirement for those who engaged in sexual intercourse with minors under 16 was a distinction without rational support.</SPAN></P>

While the instruction given to the jury did not require it to find appellant was likely to engage in &quot;predatory&quot; behavior, under the circumstances, it was harmless and did not prejudice appellant. The court found that the two classes of offenders in the Act and another sex offender statute posed different risks to the general public and were not similarly situated. Further, the Act was narrowly drafted to serve a legitimate/compelling state interest. Thus, the Act did not violate equal protection guarantees.

He claimed he received ineffective assistance and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant additionally urged the use of his prior rape conviction both as an element of the substantive registration offense and as a strike to enhance his sentence was improper. The court determined that the lower court properly used defendant's prior rape conviction both as an element of the Cal. Penal code &sect; 290(a)(1) violation and as a violation as a strike that augmented defendant's sentence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.12(c)(2). The court determined that the Three Strikes law was intended to apply to all recidivists coming within its terms. This intent would be frustrated by allowing the limitation of prior convictions that could be used to trigger application of the Three Strikes law. Prohibiting the dual use of prior convictions was inconsistent with the Three Strikes law as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When government entities circumvented proposition 13 &quot;tax&quot; restrictions by passing &quot;special assessments,&quot; the electorate adopted Proposition 218, which amended the California Constitution by placing analogous restrictions on assessments, fees, and charges. Plaintiffs, three organizations that advocated tax reduction, challenged the defendant City of Riverside's (City) annual assessment to pay electricity for streetlights after an election to continue the assessment did not pass by the two-thirds vote required by Proposition 218. The court held that the City's pre-existing streetlighting assessment was grandfathered and exempt under Proposition 218. The court found that electrical current was necessary to operate streetlights; which were necessary to operate streets and sidewalks by making streets and sidewalks safer. The Cal. Const. art. XIII D, &sect; 5 (a), exempting assessments which financed the capital costs or maintenance and operation expenses for sidewalks, streets, sewers, water, flood control, drainage systems, or vector control, applied to this assessment.</SPAN></P>

The decedent resided in California until her death. The state controller issued tax deficiency notice to appellants, executors of estate, because state tax return did not include value of trust. Appellants filed a complaint to have deficiency declared invalid. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court ruled deficiency was proper. Appellants then sought review. The court concluded that whether tax was owed under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 13302 depended on whether decedent owned the property in the QTIP trust, and analyzed whether decedent could be said to have owned the property under federal, California, or United States Virgin Islands law. The court found that she would not be considered the owner of the trust property under federal, California, or United States Virgin Islands law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brought suit against respondent for both injunctive relief and damages for violations of his civil rights. The suit resulted from respondent's denial of appellant's application to open an adult nightclub.

The trial court found that the ordinance was constitutional, based on a previous denial of appellant's request for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the court reversed because it found that the amended ordinance did not pass constitutional muster. The court found that respondent could not utilize &quot;redevelopment&quot; as a means to arbitrarily exclude adult businesses. Respondent could not use its power to zone as a pretext for suppressing appellant's U.S. Const. amend. I rights. As such, the court ordered that the judgment of the trial court be reversed and the case remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding appellants conducted charity fundraising activities for profit in disregard of fiduciary duties and statutory law, Superior Court of Orange County (California), enjoined appellants from fundraising pending a complete accounting, ordered appellants to register as commercial fundraisers and maintain required bonds, imposed charitable trust on moneys recovered, and reserved jurisdiction to determine authorized civil penalties and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seeking to vindicate the public interest, respondent attorney general brought action against the predatory practices of more than 130 individual and business entities engaged in commercial fundraising. Causes of action included conspiracy to defraud, unfair competition, false advertising, and breach of fiduciary duty. Pending an accounting, the trial court enjoined appellants from fundraising and imposed a charitable trust on any moneys recovered. Because civil penalties were authorized by various statutes, the court reserved jurisdiction to determine the proper formula to be applied upon completion of the accounting. Under the Uniform Supervision of Trustees for Charitable Purposes Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 12598(b)-(c), the trial court concluded that respondent was entitled to an award for the costs of investigating and bringing the action. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed, holding that evidence was sufficient to bar appellants from carrying on fundraising activities until they complied with the law.  Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 17206, 17536, authorized penalties of up to $ 2,500 for each separate act in violation of false advertising and unfair competition laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment enjoining appellants from commercial fundraising until they complied with law and accounted for prior fundraising activities because recordkeeping deficiencies and overall pattern of misrepresentation supported detailed injunctive relief. Moreover, public interest justified imposition of constructive charitable trust. Costs were awarded because respondent's action corrected breach of trust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State Board of Equalization, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), following remand by the Supreme Court, in favor of respondent corporation for a refund of use tax and interest on musical instruments and promotional brochures stored in California and shipped as gifts to out-of-state donees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent purchased musical instruments outside of California under resale certificates and stored them in a California warehouse. Some of the instruments were given as promotional gifts. The donated instruments were delivered via common carrier. Respondent contested the imposition of tax on the gifts to out-of-state recipients by the State Board of Equalization (SBE) and filed suit for refund on the ground that the property was exempt under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;6009.1, which exempted property stored in California for the purposes of transporting it out of state. The trial court ruled in favor of respondent. The court of appeal reversed, relying primarily on an annotation prepared by sales tax counsel for the SBE. The supreme court reversed the court of appeal and remanded the case for reconsideration because the court of appeal had given improper weight to the sales tax counsel's opinion. On remand, using its independent interpretation of &sect;6009.1, and the principles of gift law, the court still held respondent liable for use tax because the gifts were complete when respondent delivered the property to common carriers in California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's judgment refunding use tax and interest to respondent was reversed because the taxation of the gifts was properly imposed when such gifts were complete when respondent delivered the property to common carriers in California, and the taxation did not violate the &quot;dormant&quot; commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found that defendant intentionally confined the victim in a manner that exposed the victim to a substantial likelihood of death so as to support a sentence of life without the possibility of parole under Cal.

Penal Code &sect; 654, which prohibited multiple punishment for a single act, because defendant had used a firearm during the burglary.

On review, the court affirmed judgments with modification that a $ 200 parole revocation fine, to remain suspended unless and until defendant violates parole, be imposed.

The court determined that California's workers' compensation law afforded compensation to employees hired in California and injured out of state under Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3600.5 and Cal. Lab.

After review, the court concluded that Cal. Evid.

The juvenile court upheld the charges and convicted and sentenced defendant for the same. On appeal, defendant challenged only the finding on the lynching charge, contending that the lynching statutes were enacted to protect victims of lynching from harm, and therefore could not be violated by a person who was the subject of the lynching. The court affirmed, holding that under California law, lynching included any participation in riotous conduct aimed at freeing a person from the custody of a peace officer. Because defendant took part in a riot leading to his escape from custody, he could indeed be convicted of his own lynching.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from the Alameda County Superior Court (California), which denied their request for a writ of mandate and injunctive and declaratory relief against defendant governor because it found that Cal. Pub. Cont. Code &sect; 10115.5 requiring reporting of the number of minority contracts awards was not severable from the remainder of the affirmative action statute that had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit seeking to enforce Cal. Pub. Cont. Code &sect; 10115.5 that required state agencies to report on the number of minority contracts awarded. Defendant governor had issued an executive order directing agencies not to comply with the statute after the courts struck down the affirmative action program of which Cal. Pub. Cont. Code &sect; 10115.5 was a part. The trial court found that the reporting statute was not severable from the unconstitutional provisions and denied relief. Plaintiffs appealed and the court affirmed. The statute contained a savings clause, Cal. Pub. Cont. Code &sect; 10115.8, but the court found that the reporting provision was not complete in itself and would not have been adopted without the invalidated portion. The court examined the statute on three bases, looking at whether it was grammatically, mechanically, and volitionally separable. The reporting was tied to the enforcement of the statute and was not intended simply as a reporting law to gather information. The court said that when the main purpose of a statute was defeated by the unconstitutionality of a part, the whole act was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of relief to plaintiffs seeking to enforce the reporting element of an unconstitutional affirmative action program. The provision of the statute that required reporting of minority contracts awarded by state agencies was not complete in itself and would not have been adopted independent of the invalidated affirmative action provisions of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold methamphetamine to an undercover agent on two occasions and was charged with selling the drug. Six years earlier, when defendant was seventeen, he was adjudged a ward of the court following a sustained petition alleging first-degree burglary. Plaintiff amended complaint to add the allegation of a prior strike regarding the three strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the prior charge. Defendant entered a plea of no contest to the drug charges. He was sentenced to prison and obtained a certificate of probable cause to bring the appeal. The appellate court reversed the order due to the statutory rules of construction, thus defendant's juvenile adjudication for the serious and violent felony of first-degree burglary, that would have been a strike if committed by an adult, was not counted as a conviction or a prior strike.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Kern County (California) because the trial court was not aware it had discretion to strike one or more of his prior serious felony convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of engaging in oral copulation while confined in a detention center. In addition, appellant had a prior juvenile adjudication for rape and an adult rape conviction within the definition of the three strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667. Appellant challenged his sentence enhancement, claiming it violated his U.S. Constitutional rights. Appellant alleged that the court improperly considered a juvenile adjudication in which he did not have a trial by jury and did not waive his right to a trial by a jury. The court held that the lower court properly considered the juvenile matter because appellant had demonstrated a propensity toward criminal activity and that his failure to learn from his previous mistakes warranted a harsher adult sentence. The case was remanded to determine whether a prior strike should be stricken in the interests of justice, however.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's application of the three strikes statute even though it considered a juvenile conviction. The court found that appellant had failed to draw any lessons from his prior judicial determinations and his conduct warranted a more severe punishment.</SPAN></P>

Mother filed a pleading seeking physical custody in the event custody was to be awarded to persons other than respondents. The trial court granted respondents' guardianship petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant irrigation district appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Fresno County (California) holding that plaintiff employee was not required to exhaust an internal grievance procedure prior to filing suit for wrongful termination, that plaintiff was not in a safety-sensitive position, and that a random drug test violated plaintiff's constitutional right to privacy and his right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of a judgment holding that plaintiff employee's suit was not barred by his failure to exhaust defendant irrigation district's internal grievance procedure but reversed that part holding that a random drug test violated his constitutional right to privacy and his right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. Whether plaintiff held a safety-sensitive position, which would justify a random drug test, was a mixed question of law and fact involving values underlying legal principles, and therefore de novo review was appropriate. The court concluded that plaintiff's position was correctly designated safety-sensitive because there existed both a hazardous working environment and hazards inherent in the work itself. Plaintiff's privacy interests were diminished by the fact that defendant gave six months notice before implementing the drug-testing policy. Moreover, plaintiff's privacy interests were outweighed by defendant's legitimate and substantial safety-related reasons for randomly drug testing its construction and maintenance workers. Therefore, the random drug test did not violate plaintiff's constitutional's rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the holding that plaintiff was not required to exhaust internal grievance procedures before filing a suit for wrongful termination and reversed the holding that plaintiff's constitutional rights were violated by a random drug test. Plaintiff's job was properly classified as safety-sensitive, and defendant's interests in minimizing the risk of harm to employees outweighed plaintiff's privacy interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed an order denying the motion of appellant, a county tax assessor, to vacate a judgment in respondent taxpayer's tax refund action stipulated to by respondent, the county board of supervisors (CBS). The judgment, to which appellant was not a party, reduced the base-year value of respondent's apartment complex property and provided for refunds from 1984 forward based on the value recalculation. The court, finding that it had authority to reject an unjust stipulation and that appellant had standing to appeal a void judgment that revised base-year value and reduced assessments, concluded that the judgment was void because it granted relief that the lower court had no power to grant in the exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction. The exercise of judgment as to the value of the property was conferred only on the county board of equalization (CBE). Respondent CBS could not confer jurisdiction upon the lower court to equalize individual assessments, and remand was necessary to allow the CBE to determine value. Furthermore, the lower court had no authority to retroactively apply a reduction in base-year value to years predating the assessment appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the petition, finding that the burden on respondents far outweighed any inconvenience to appellant. The appellate court reversed the judgment, holding that the trial court erred in applying the compelling state interest test to respondents' free exercise of religion challenge. The court found that the statutory requirement that applicants provide a Social Security number met the rational basis test because it was wholly neutral in religious terms and uniformly applicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had three prior serious felony convictions, was charged and convicted with the felonies of possessing methamphetamine and attempting by threat to deter a peace officer from carrying out his duty, and the misdemeanors of driving under the influence, driving with a blood-alcohol level over the legal limit, and using phencyclidine. Due to defendant's three prior &quot;strike&quot; felonies, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant contended on appeal that his sentence was unconstitutionally cruel or unusual. The court held that after considering the nature of the offender, defendant's recidivism warranted lengthy incarceration. Defendant was a repeat offender who seemingly had not learned from past incarceration. Defendant's prior felonies involved express and implicit threats of violence. The record indicated that defendant had been prone to violence or the threat of violence. Further, simply because California's repeat offender, or &quot;three strikes&quot; statute, was among the most extreme did not compel the conclusion that it was unconstitutionally cruel or unusual. The court concluded that defendant's sentence did not shock its conscience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant authority was created to acquire and run the local airport.

Plaintiff city sought injunctive and declaratory relief to enjoin authority from using the land without approval and to affirm the validity of &sect; 21661.6. The trial court ruled in favor of defendant, based on its finding that city had delegated its powers to authority and could not challenge it. City and state intervenor appealed. The court held that all agencies, as well as city, were subject to the approval process under Cal. Gov. Code &sect; 53091. This did not create a veto power. The city could not delegate its discretionary powers in a way as to totally abdicate them. The court found that control of airplanes had been preempted by the federal government, but not the land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that sustained defendant customer's demurrer to an action alleging, inter alia, breach of a contract for the purchase of restaurant supplies for defendant's business in Canada, after ruling that the tolling provisions of the statute of limitations, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 351, violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several years after defendant customer failed to pay for restaurant supplies that were ordered and delivered to his business in Canada, plaintiff company sued for, inter alia, breach of contract. California was defendant's place of residence and plaintiff's place of business. Defendant demurred, pursuant to the statute of limitations, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 351. The demurrer was sustained, with the trial court ruling that the tolling provisions of &sect; 351 for a defendant's absence from the state impermissibly burdened persons engaged in interstate commerce and violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Plaintiff appealed. In reversing, the court agreed that &sect; 351 imposed an unconstitutional burden on residents who traveled in the course of interstate commerce that was not shared by residents involved in local trade. However, the tolling provisions did not violate the Commerce Clause with respect periods of out-of-state travel that were unrelated to interstate commerce. Since plaintiff's complaint did not specify the extent to which defendant's absences were in the course of interstate commerce, application of &sect; 351 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment sustaining the demurrer was reversed because defendant was absent from his residence in the state for periods sufficient to toll the running of the statute of limitations and because plaintiff's complaint did not describe the extent to which those absences were in the course of interstate commerce, so they did not establish that application of the tolling provisions violated the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mortgage company sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) that granted nationwide class certification in an action brought by plaintiffs that alleged defendant's forced placement insurance program was an unfair business practice under California's unfair competition law pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought action against defendant mortgage company that alleged its forced placement insurance (FPI) program was an unfair business practice under California's unfair competition law (UCL) pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17200 et seq. Plaintiffs were granted nationwide class certification, and defendant appealed. In reversing the order, the court identified three categories of class members and held Category III members, non-California residents for whom defendant's conduct of purchasing FPI in states other than California, could not assert the UCL claim. Plaintiffs did not cite any authority that construed the UCL as applicable to claims of non-California residents injured by conduct occurring beyond California's borders. The 1992 amendment clarified the scope of injunctive relief available to a plaintiff who was already entitled to pursue a claim under the UCL, but did not expand the conduct regulated by the UCL. Diamond did not support plaintiffs' effort to include Category III members in the nationwide class. The choice of law rules never became relevant because there was no issue to be evaluated with respect to the claims of Category III members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that granted plaintiffs' motion to certify the class action, holding the unfair competition law claim could not form the basis for the nationwide class because the claims of non-California residents for whom defendant's conduct of purchasing forced placement insurance occurred in states other than California (Category III members) would be arbitrary and unfair and transgress due process limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the city and county of San Francisco, sought review of a child support order calculated by granting to respondent father, in contravention of the provisions of Cal.

The court held &sect; 4071.5 was not subject to strict scrutiny because the statutory classification between children whose parents could and could not claim the hardship deduction was not based on an immutable trait or a disfavored characteristic. Even if the right of the resident children to be supported by respondent was fundamental, the burden on that right was indirect and uncertain where the amount of money used to support the resident children was subject to other laws, economic factors, and parental choices. The court also held &sect; 4071.5 was not violative of equal protection because it was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of maximizing recoupment from parents of public funds spent for their children's basic needs. Accordingly, the child support order was reversed and remanded for recomputation in accordance with &sect; 4071.5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his commitment to two years in a state mental hospital as a sexually violent predator and contended the trial court erred by overruling his objection to the use of noncertified documents to prove his out-of-state prior convictions. The court stated that nothing in the Sexually Violent Predators Act (the act), Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6600 et seq., suggested any legislative intent to create an exception to the mandate of Cal. Evid. Code &sect;&sect; 1530 and 1531 that a writing be certified before it was introduced into evidence. The court held that because a person's liberty interest was at stake in a proceeding under the act, he or she had the right of confrontation and cross-examination, and without the safeguard of certification, the hearsay in writings was not sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted and used against defendant. After rejecting defendant's other assertions of error, the court held defendant's out-of-state prior convictions were improperly proved by noncertified documents, reversed the order of commitment, and remanded the case for a limited retrial of the question whether sufficient evidence supported the requisite prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiff asserted its fee collection practices were permissible under the newly enacted Cal. Penal code &sect; 337(j). The court agreed and held that the legislature's September 1998 revision of &sect; 337(j) explicitly authorized plaintiff's fee collection practices, was not unconstitutional, and was properly enacted as urgency legislation.

Appellant told officers that he was discharged from parole, and officer secured the area until they could verify the information. During this time, the officer interviewed a woman in the room, who admitted to taking drugs and stated that there was drugs paraphernalia in a nearby briefcase. Police found money and drugs in the briefcase and thereafter learned that appellant was released from parole. Appellant was arrested and convicted of drug possession. Appellant challenged his conviction, and the court held that the initial entry was unconstitutional, but the evidence was neither tainted nor inadmissible because the officers had a good faith belief that appellant was on parole. The court affirmed the conviction, arguing that the U.S. Const. amend. IV's exclusion clause did not apply in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that while the police officers' entry into appellant's motel room was unconstitutional, the officers had a good faith belief for their actions, and the evidence was properly admitted at trial because it was in plain view and the officer later developed probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners submitted a petition for writ of mandamus to invalidate the approval by the California Coastal Commission of development plans devised by respondents for a tract of land. Upon judicial review of the administrative decision, both respondents and petitioners appealed. Respondents objected to the court's requirement that a pond be preserved and to the prohibition of their development in a wetlands area. Petitioners disputed the court's conclusion that the Coastal Act allowed relocation of an environmentally sensitive habitat. On appeal, the court reviewed the record and delineated the lower court's standard of review, which was to determine whether the commission's findings were supported by substantial evidence. After a lengthy discussion of the operative aspects of the plan itself and the mandate of the Act, the court refuted the determination that the relocation of the habitat was permissible and reversed this portion of its judgment. However, the lower court was correct in concluding that neither development of the wetlands nor the filling of the pond were permitted under the Act. An assessment of attorney's fees against respondents was also upheld.</SPAN></P>

The court found that absent a case where the trial court relied heavily upon the presence of corroborating evidence in making its determination that a statement bore indicia of reliability, the confrontation clause would not be violated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Butte County (California) for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;12021(a)(1) contending that the actions of his Arizona conviction would not have been a felony in California, and that the full faith and credit clause of U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his California trial conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm contending that the conduct he was convicted of in Arizona would not be a felony in California, and that the full faith and credit clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 required that California honor that under Arizona law, the place of his previous felony conviction, that he was eligible to possess a firearm. The court examined Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021(a)(1), the statute of defendant's conviction, which stated that any person convicted of a felony under the laws of the United States, of the state of California, or any other state, government, or country who owned, or had in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control, any firearm, was guilty of a felony. The court also examined full faith and credit clause precedent which stated that states could not legislate for each other across state lines so as to preclude a state from prescribing the legal consequences for acts within it. Concluding that California could execute its public policy to preclude convicted felons from possessing firearms within its borders, the trial court judgment against defendant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for carrying a concealed firearm within a vehicle, a violation of Cal. Pen. Code &sect; 12025(a). Defendant moved to have the conviction and sentence reversed on multiple grounds. The court denied defendant relief. The court determined that under the test of reasonable certainty, &sect; 12025(a) easily passed muster as a constitutional statute because it described the prohibited conduct in readily understandable terms, using precisely quantified standards. Because the vagueness challenge to the ordinance failed, defendant did not show that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress the evidence on this ground. The court held that &sect; 12025(a) could not be said to violate substantive due process on its face because it arbitrarily and irrationally criminalized conduct that reduced the risk of harm from transporting guns in vehicles, because the statute requires that cases transporting weapons be locked. Finally, the court determined that defendant waived the contention that he was denied a fair trial, the challenge to one probation condition, and the imposition of a booking fee.</SPAN></P>

The court gave effect to the words of Fresno City charter &sect; 809 as a statement of the city's fundamental labor policy, and not merely to the practical effect it had in firefighter and police wage negotiations. The court concluded the unions had no stake under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 3500 et seq., which required cities to meet and confer regarding conditions of employment, in determining whether citizens of Fresno directed an opening bargaining position to be assumed by the city's labor negotiators. The minimum salary formula was not a mandatory subject of bargaining. The court concluded that repeal of charter &sect; 809, with postcontract effects only, was not within the scope of the zipper clause and placing a repeal proposal on the ballot did not change the status quo so long as wages continued to be set consistent with the formula during negotiations.</SPAN></P>

As a result of these Executive Orders, all state employers, including local governmental agencies, were required to provide the designated clothing and equipment for their fire fighting employees.

A decision that the state was not obligated to reimburse appellants for the funds it spent in compliance with the Executive Orders was reversed and remanded.  Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 17581 was nothing more than an impermissible attempt to exercise supervisorial control over the manner in which the executive branch executed the laws enacted by the legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver appealed his conviction entered in the Superior Court of Marin County (California), for failure to stop and report an accident as required by the Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 20001, 20003, and for giving false information to a police officer in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 31.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver picked up a tourist, who suddenly jumped from defendant's car while the car was moving. Defendant was shocked and did not stop immediately. Instead he continued down the road, turned around, and returned to the scene. When questioned about the accident, defendant did not immediately inform the investigating officer of his involvement. Defendant eventually provided the officer with a detailed statement concerning the events leading up to accident. Defendant was subsequently convicted of failing to report an accident in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect;&sect; 20001, 20003. Defendant appealed his conviction and contended that the reporting statutes violated his Fifth Amendment right to be free from self-incrimination. The court discussed the legislative history behind the statute, methods of statutory interpretation, and the Fifth Amendment issue. The court concluded that the purpose of the reporting statutes was to promote satisfaction of civil liabilities arising from automobile accidents. The court also rejected defendant's contention that no reportable accident had occurred; thus, he was not obligated to contact police. Thus, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the legitimate aim of California's compulsory reporting statutes were civil remediation and regulation of drivers who use the roadways in California. A driver's right to be free from being compelled to be a witness against himself was not violated by the reporting statutes. Thus, defendant driver's conviction for failure to report an accident was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Tulare County (California) denying appellant's petition for writ of mandate requiring respondents to hold an administrative hearing as to respondents' right to withhold payment of fees claimed by appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a dentist whose patients were indigents who were beneficiaries of Medi-Cal services. Appellant submitted the bills to respondent, and respondent reviewed the bills in accordance with the regulatory scheme before making payment. A search warrant for appellant's business offices was obtained as a result of an ongoing fraud investigation concerning appellant's billing practices. Respondents provided appellant with notification that payments were to be withheld. A criminal complaint was filed charging appellant with fraud for billing for services not provided. Denial of appellant's petition for a writ of mandate was affirmed. There was no duty to conduct a hearing under statute or regulation. Respondents were permitted pursuant to 42 C.F.R. &sect; 455.23 (1998) to withhold payments to appellant when provided with reliable evidence that there was fraud. The search warrant was sufficient under the notice requirements of the regulation. Appellant was told she could submit written evidence for consideration by respondents. The interest in maintaining the integrity of the Medi-Cal system justified the temporary withholding of payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the writ because due process did not require respondents to hold an administrative hearing as to its right to withhold payment of fees. Given the procedural notice mechanisms and the opportunity afforded appellant to respond to the withholding notice, the dictates of due process were met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conservatee appealed from a probate court order approving the petition filed by respondents, conservatee's parents and coconservators, for an order authorizing the coconservators to give medical consent for conservatee's sterilization under Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1950 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conservatee, severely mentally retarded and autistic woman, challenged an order approving petition filed by coconservators for an order authorizing consent for conservatee's sterilization pursuant to Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1950 et seq. Conservatee contended she was not likely to engage in sexual activity or that supervision was an alternative to sterilization. Conservatee alleged that requirements under Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1958 were not established and the failure to satisfy all elements was fatal to order. The court concluded &sect; 1958(c) authorized sterilization of incapacitated persons under certain conditions and Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 1959 could not constitutionally be applied to deny coconservators the authorization to consent to sterilization. Section 1959 denied consideration of fact that disabled person may be vulnerable to unlawful sexual conduct by others. The court determined that &sect; 1959 denied to conservatee the reproductive choices available to individuals without disabilities. The provision in &sect; 1959 that made it logically impossible for conservator to make the necessary showing under the chapter was inconsistent with intent of permitting sterilization with appropriate safeguards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order authorizing consent for conservatee's sterilization was affirmed where conservators established beyond a reasonable doubt the requirements of &sect; 1958; the facts were compelling and the proceedings were carried out with diligence and attention to conservatee's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant both appealed an order from the Superior Court of Marin County (California) offsetting plaintiff damages for the value of lost property from boarding fees due defendant pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 597.1. Defendant also appealed the refusal to award it veterinary expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified a judgment reversing plaintiff pet store owner's award for damages for lost property, and awarding defendant humane society its boarding and veterinary expenses. The court found plaintiff waived the issue of whether his due process rights were violated because the issue was not preserved for appeal. The court agreed that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 597.1, the police officer's warrantless entry into plaintiff's exotic pet store was proper to protect the health of the animals. The officer could smell dead animals from outside the store, could not see inside or find plaintiff. The court held that plaintiff was properly denied an evidentiary hearing because he had received relief from default twice, over six weeks had passed since damages were decided, and it would not have affected the result. The court found plaintiff was not entitled to damages because plaintiff failed to pay the lien charges, and to give assurances that he would provide the animals with necessary care, and thus, the animals were abandoned under &sect; 597.1. The court ruled defendant was entitled to recover its costs and fees because defendant's lien made plaintiff personally liable as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's award for his seized animals was reversed because he no longer owned them under the law. Because plaintiff failed to pay the lien charges, and to give assurances that he would provide the animals with necessary care, the animals were deemed abandoned. The court also awarded defendant boarding and veterinary fees because plaintiff was personally liable after a lien had been issued.</SPAN></P>

The record contained substantial evidence that the defense was based on: (1) a thorough evaluation of the applicable statute and relevant cases; (2) an adequate investigation; and (3) a reasonable professional judgment that it would be too risky to open the door to evidence of appellant's prior conviction by explicitly arguing and requesting instruction on a theory of &quot;innocent use.&quot; Defense counsel made a valid choice of tactics, his representation was not deficient in any material way, and appellant's claim for ineffective assistance of counsel failed as a matter of law. Any error in the trial court's failure to instruct was plainly harmless, based on appellant's concession that he was carrying a knife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Los Angeles County (California), which held in favor of plaintiff in an action in tort alleging tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business practices in violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, &sect; 17200.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured brought an action against defendant, his workers' compensation insurer, to recover for unfair business practices, based on allegations relating to defendant's case reserve and claims handling policies. Defendant appealed a judgment in favor of plaintiff, awarding damages and issuing an injunction against defendant, arguing an insured employer was prohibited from recovering tort damages where the only damage claimed was the impact on future premiums, its reserving practices could not support a bad faith judgment, and the punitive damages award must be reversed. The court ruled that an insurer could be liable if it processed claims and set reserves without good faith regard for their impact on the insured's premiums and potential dividends. Further, the court held that there was substantial evidence which supported the finding of bad faith in defendant's implementation of Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 923.5. The court affirmed the judgment, and reversed the punitive damage award, concluding that the goal of punitive damages was to award an amount that was sufficient to deter the conduct but was not excessive and that the amount awarded by the trial jury was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged an order from the Superior Court of Stanislaus County (California), which deviated from a calculated child support amount in determining appellee father's child support payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed for an income and expense declaration. At the time, his son received public assistance. The lower court calculated an amount based upon appellee's gross income. After deciding on the calculations, the lower court chose to deviate from the presumed amount based on the previous support order, additional children, and appellee's current expenses. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in granting appellee a deduction pursuant to Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 4071.5. The appellate court analyzed whether the statute was constitutional. It applied a rational basis standard because the statute identified non-suspect classes of parents, children, and siblings. The statute implicated the fundamental right to raise one's own children in his or own home. The court concluded that the statute's requirements that a noncustodial parent take full responsibility for his or her calculated guideline share of support in raising a noncustodial child was rationally related to the allocation of limited public funds. Therefore, the statute was constitutional. On remand, the trial court was directed to redetermine appellee's child support payments in conformity with guideline amounts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order that awarded child support after it deviated from guideline amounts was reversed. As a nonconstodial parent with a child on public assistance, appellee could not obtain a deduction under state law. The case was remanded to recalculate the child support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff government appealed the order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) that refused to apply Cal. Fam. Code &sect;4071.5, which precluded a hardship deduction, when it calculated the child support owed by respondent father for his daughter because the court found that &sect; 4071.5&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against low income parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff government filed a motion to modify the child support that defendant father owed for his daughter. His daughter lived with her maternal grandmother and the child received welfare. Defendant had full custody of his son, who lived with him. The trial court refused to apply Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 4071.5, which precluded a parent from receiving a hardship deduction on child support if welfare payments were made on the child's behalf. Plaintiff sought review. On appeal, defendant argued that his son's equal protection rights were violated by &sect; 4071.5 because without the hardship deduction, defendant had less disposable income to spend on his son, a situation not faced by children whose nonresident siblings do not receive welfare. The appellate court found that the rational basis test, instead of the strict scrutiny test, applied. The court reversed the order and determined that disallowing parents' reduction in their support obligations for nonresident children who receive public assistance was related to the legitimate state purposes of relieving the public burden of supporting the impoverished, and maximizing the benefit payments available for all needy children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed an order that refused to apply a statutory preclusion of hardship deduction to defendant father. The court held that the statute was constitutional under equal protection analysis. Thus, the statute applied because questions respecting its wisdom were not within the province of courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of failing to register as a sex offender. On review, appellant claimed he received ineffective assistance in that his attorney failed to defend against the charge on the ground that appellant had not been constitutionally convicted of the prior offense. The court found appellant could not demonstrate a reasonable probability that a collateral challenge to the prior conviction would have been successful. Therefore, his counsel was not ineffective by failing to pursue that defense. Appellant also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, urging that the use of his prior rape conviction both as an element of the substantive registration offense and as a sentence enhancement was improper. The court determined the lower court properly used defendant's prior rape conviction as a &quot;strike&quot; that augmented defendant's sentence under the &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law, Cal. Penal Code &sect;1170.12(d)(2). The court determined that &sect;1170.12(d)(2) was intended to apply to all recidivists coming within its terms, and thus its specific language overruled the general rule that a single fact could not be the basis both of an element of the charged offense and of a sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence and denied the habeas corpus petition because appellant's prior rape conviction was properly used as both an element of failure to register violation and as a strike that enhanced his sentence, and his counsel was not ineffective for failing to defend on the basis that the prior conviction was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, members of a county deputy sheriff's association, submitted an initiative to the county clerk that would have permitted local voters to set county supervisors' salaries by initiative. Plaintiff, county counsel, sought a declaration that the proposed initiative was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the relief plaintiff had requested, holding that the initiative was unconstitutional pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1(b). The court affirmed. The plain language of Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1(b) authorized voters to challenge county supervisors' salaries by referendum, not by initiative. Further, the specified &quot;governing body&quot; that had the constitutional power to prescribe by ordinance the compensation of its members could only refer to a local legislative body, not to voters. The court rejected defendants' argument that the right to referendum implied the right to initiative. Referendum and initiative had different purposes: initiative allowed voters to propose new legislation, while referendum permitted voters to reject legislation that had already been adopted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment that an initiative proposed by defendants, members of a county deputy sheriff's association, violated the state constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff obtained and levied on a writ of attachment against defendant in a parallel action brought by plaintiff. The trial court entered summary judgment for defendants on grounds that plaintiff's election of remedies sacrificed its tort claims against individual defendants in the action.

The court held that plaintiff's attachment was obtained against a different party on a different claim, which did not involve those individual defendants and was obtained in a different action. Plaintiff sued individual defendants for conversion and fraud, not breach of the settlement agreement. The claims against individual defendants did not arise out of the same operative facts (the settlement agreement and its breach) but instead out of different operative facts (the false promises, the presentation of false information to the international shipper, the hiding of assets, etc.). Further, the court held that individual defendants did not show they were &quot;substantially prejudiced&quot; by enforcement of plaintiff's statutory rights.</SPAN></P>

The court denied petitioners' request and held that the trial court's destruction of petitioners' exhibits did not deny them due process. The court went on to hold that the trial court was not obligated to hold an evidentiary hearing on their requests because petitioners failed to make a specific, detailed showing concerning the potential merit of a collateral attack and the significance of particular exhibits to the defense. Finally, the court recognized that the trial court does not have a never-ending duty to preserve the integrity of every exhibit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) that entered judgment for plaintiffs in an action brought seeking a declaration that Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 25373(d)(e) (1994) was unconstitutional. After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the lower court granted plaintiffs' motion and denied that of the state, concluding that &sect; 25373(d)(e) violated state and federal establishment clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were the City and County of San Francisco and various private, nonprofit organizations which challenged the constitutionality of certain state landmark preservation exemptions given to non-profit religiously affiliated organizations. The lower court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs holding that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 25373(d)(e) (1994), violated the state and federal establishment clauses and was an unconstitutional delegation of governmental powers to private entities. On review, the court reversed, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional because the exemptions from historic preservation laws was for the express purpose of ensuring the protection of religious freedom guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions, not to advance religion. The court further found that the statute was not an impermissible delegation of power to private entities, holding that protection of religious freedom was more than a local concern and that the religious organizations had not been given authority to designate or regulate properties to be preserved as landmarks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the lower court and held the statute in question was constitutional. The statute did not constitute either an endorsement or infringement of religion, but merely eliminated a burden imposed by the government. The statute was also not an unlawful delegation of legislative powers as religious organizations had not been given any authority to designate or regulate properties to be preserved as landmarks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs distributed anonymous campaign literature in violation of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 84305, and the constitutionally of the statute was upheld by the California Supreme Court, which remanded back to the trial court for adjudication. After remand, the U.S. Supreme Court found that a similar Ohio statute was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I. Plaintiffs then at the trial level, again attacked the constitutionality of the state statute, and the trial court refused to consider their arguments, holding the law of the case doctrine precluded their arguments. Plaintiffs appealed the trial court's ruling, and the court reversed. The court held that the law of the case doctrine was a procedural rule, that will not be adhered to where the application would result in an unjust decision. The court stated that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision invalidating a similar state law had a direct effect upon the present litigation. The court concluded that based upon the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the U.S. Const. amend I, the statute was unconstitutional. The court granted plaintiff's challenge to the law, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and held that law of the case doctrine did not apply due to an intervening U.S. Supreme Court case, and, therefore, plaintiff's challenge to the constitutionality of the state statute was correct, as the statute violated the First Amendment. The court remanded for further proceedings in accordance with its decision.</SPAN></P>

Contractor also filed for indemnity and declaratory relief. Cross-claims went to arbitration. Appellant was awarded defense costs, but no indemnity because its insured, the general contractor, was solely negligent. On appeal, the court affirmed, having jurisdiction because the arbitration was changed to a reference nunc pro tunc, the gist of the proceedings were a reference, it reflected the parties intent, and the proper legal formalities were preserved. The court held that sufficient evidence supported the findings. The contractor was in sole control of the area where the flooding was and could have prevented or ameliorated the hazards. The court ruled that the general contractor was not entitled to indemnity as an additional insured because the endorsement was limited to general supervision, but was fully protected under its own policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), which ruled that a city ordinance that required poolrooms to close between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. was unconstitutional because the classification of poolrooms bore no rational relationship to the purpose of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city had an old ordinance that required poolrooms to have licenses. The ordinance required the city council to investigate applicants for licenses. When four poolrooms opened and applied for licenses, the city council placed a moratorium on permits because they did not want to do the investigations. A police officer was assigned to draft a new ordinance that transferred the duty of investigating applicants to the police department. The officer inserted a mandatory four-hour closure period for poolrooms between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. The ordinance was passed. Appellee, who owned a poolroom open 24 hours, filed a lawsuit challenging the ordinance. Applying the rational basis test, the trial court found the ordinance unconstitutional under the equal protection clauses of both the federal and state constitutions. On appeal, the court found that the purpose of the ordinance was to transfer investigatory power to the police department and that regulation of hours was unrelated to this purpose. Also, the court determined that singling poolrooms out from other places of amusement constituted a classification scheme that was arbitrary, discriminatory, and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that a city ordinance that required poolrooms to close between 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. was unconstitutional. Analyzing the ordinance under the rational basis test, the court concluded that the classification scheme, which treated poolrooms differently from other places of amusement, was arbitrary in light of appellant city's stated purpose of reducing crime.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sued defendant for breach of contract. The trial court stayed the action because defendant filed a petition to determine controversy with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE). The DLSE issued a final determination that the contract was void and unenforceable. While plaintiff had only 15 days to file a notice of appeal to obtain de novo review by the trial court, plaintiff filed an appeal three months later. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal because the time limit was jurisdictional, and even a constitutionally based attack was subject to the time limit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff partnership's breach of contract action against defendant singer because the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to the untimeliness of the filing of plaintiff's appeal of an adverse administrative determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with eight counts of lewd conduct with a child, all of which allegedly occurred between 1965 and 1972. Defendant demurred arguing that the statute of limitations in effect at the time of the charged offenses had expired and could not be revived by a 1994 amendment extending the limitations period. The demurrer was overruled, but a division of the appellate court granted defendant's petition for a writ of mandate. The legislature again amended the statute, and defendant was again charged. Defendant successfully demurred, and the lower court denied plaintiff state's motion for an order directing that the complaint be reinstated. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that the legislature could put reasonable restrictions upon the constitutional functions of the courts provided that such legislatively imposed restrictions did not defeat or materially impair the exercise of the courts' functions, but the legislature could not undertake to readjudicate controversies that had been litigated in the courts and resolved by final judicial judgment.

The lower court judgment was affirmed. Appellant failed to demonstrate the lower court abused its discretion in denying appellant's motion to strike prior convictions. Because appellant failed to request a supplemental probation report before he was sentenced, he waived the ability to claim that the lower court erred on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued for refund of taxes it paid to defendant municipality, claiming the business tax illegally distinguished between manufacturer-sellers, those who sold goods they manufactured within defendant, and non-manufacturing sellers, those who sold goods they manufactured outside defendant. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant and plaintiff appealed. The court ruled the business tax was unlawful as it discriminated against those who manufactured outside defendant, in violation of constitutional commerce protections. Defendant argued it did not have to refund all of the taxes collected. The court found that defendant's proposed refund failed to remove the discrimination and failed to provide clear and certain relief. However, plaintiff was not entitled to either damages or attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, as there was an adequate state remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision, as it found that the tax imposed by defendant municipality improperly discriminated against out-of-city manufacturers, and it ordered defendant to refund all taxes it had improperly collected. The court denied plaintiff's request for damages and attorney fees as there was an adequate state remedy.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 12020(a), following exclusion of evidence defendant sought to present as to his intent with respect to the instrument allegedly possessed and an instruction to the jury that intent was not an issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a traffic stop, a fixed blade knife was discovered in defendant's pocket. The blade was wrapped in cardboard and packaging tape. Defendant was charged with possession of an illegal &quot;dirk or dagger,&quot; in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12020(a). At trial, he sought to present evidence that he used the knife in his work as a mechanic and had forgotten that it was in his pocket, but the evidence was excluded upon the prosecution's objection that how the knife was used was not relevant or at issue. The jury was later given an instruction that effectively said defendant's intent was not an issue. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that mens rea was an element of &sect; 12020, which required the prosecution to prove that defendant carried the knife for use as a weapon, not as a tool. The offense was not a strict liability offense. Accordingly, defendant was entitled to present evidence of the lack of a criminal intent and his intended innocent use. For the same reason, the jury was improperly instructed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was reversed and the case remanded for retrial because the intent evidence was improperly excluded and the jury improperly instructed as to intent; possession of an illegal weapon was not a strict liability offense, rather, the prosecution was required to prove that defendant possessed a stabbing weapon and carried it for use as a weapon and not for an innocent purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a grant of summary judgment from the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), in favor of defendant construction company, in an action following plaintiff's diagnosis with asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural disease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action naming hundreds of defendants and alleging injury from asbestos exposure during work as a laborer and electrician. Defendant asked no questions at deposition and conducted no other discovery. Defendant's motion for summary judgment contended that plaintiff had no evidence to suggest defendant's presence at work sites where plaintiff's asbestos exposure allegedly occurred. The trial court failed to discern any triable issue of fact relating to the element of causation and granted defendant's motion. On appeal, plaintiff contended that without the deposition having particularly addressed defendant's presence or absence from the job-sites, the initial burden could not have been met. The court held that the initial burden of producing evidence expressly resided with the moving party and could not be shifted without the &quot;evidence and inferences&quot; described by the statute. Defendant's motion, relying upon argument rather than evidence, was insufficient to support a reasonable inference that plaintiff could not produce further evidence to support an element crucial to the claims. Thus the burden never shifted to plaintiff and the court reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant on the grounds that defendant, as the moving party, had not met its initial burden of producing evidence. The burden could not be shifted without the &quot;evidence and inferences&quot; described by the statute. The burden never shifted to plaintiff, thus summary judgment was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 1, and the state media shield law. Petitioner was adjudicated in contempt, but the order was stayed. Petitioner challenged the order. The court granted petitioner the relief it sought, but through the qualified constitutional privilege, not the media shield law, because it did not necessarily extend to paid advertisements. The court stressed the limited reach of its decision. Petitioner failed to meet its burden of proof to show the materials for which it invoked the shield law qualified as protected information. The court applied the balancing test and held that the hospital failed to meet its burden to defeat the qualified constitutional privilege by showing a compelling need to disclose the names of the anonymous authors of the advertorials, which involved core political speech.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 43150- 43156, in an action over vehicles not certified for the state's air emission standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a dealership and owner, bought vehicles out of state. After selling them in California defendants were sued by plaintiff state for violating div. 26, pt. 5, ch. 2, art. 1.5 of the Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code (division 26) &sect; 43150-43156 (&sect; 43156) because the vehicles were not certified to California air emissions standards. Defendants were fined. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on several grounds. First, plaintiff's action was timely because the statute of limitations was three years for division 26 actions and was retrospective. Second, the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7401 et seq., and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7543(b), did not preempt state emissions legislation because they both expressly waived it for California, which did not violate the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Fourth, &sect; 43156 did not violate the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it was presumed constitutional, and bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. Fifth, the penalties were not excessive under U.S. Const. amend. XIII because defendants could pay the fine and its purpose was to deter defendants from further violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that defendants, a dealership and owner, violated the state's air emissions statutes because plaintiff's action was timely under the three-year statute of limitations period, the Clean Air Act and federal legislation did not preempt the state emissions legislation because they expressly waived it for California, and the penalties were not excessive because it was for deterrence and defendants could pay the fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state agency challenged an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which found petitioner in contempt of court for disobedience of the order to cease utilizing the manual of policy and procedure to determine eligibility for federal foster care payments. Petitioner argued that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11402.1 divests petitioner of authority to comply with the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the manual of policy and procedure (MPP) provisions defining eligibility for federal foster care failed to track the federal statute. It ordered petitioner to cease utilizing those provisions. The parties disputed whether petitioner had authority to cease utilizing the MPP provisions determining eligibility for federal foster care. The court held that if petitioner had identified those eligible, Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11402.1 still precluded any state or federal payment until and unless federal financial participation is obtained. The court therefore annulled the order of contempt holding that even though petitioner's department played a principal role in drafting the legislation that precluded her from complying, the legislature, not petitioner, was empowered to and chose to enact the statute. The court stated that the statute enacted by the state legislature did not violate the federal Constitution, nor did Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 11402.1 violate the separation of powers principle of Cal. Const. art. III &sect; 3, finding no reason why the legislature could not condition funding of a federally funded program on the assurance of federal funding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled the order of contempt holding that the recently enacted statute was a valid law which petitioner was bound to apply, and that, under the circumstances of this case it prevented her from complying with the underlying order. The court further held that it was unconscionable and illegal to threaten petitioner's liberty for her acts in obedience of the intervening state statute.</SPAN></P>

Almost four years later, respondent filed his first amended complaint, which reiterated the allegations in the initial complaint and included additional violations of reporting laws. Respondent demurred to the first amended complaint on, among other grounds, the running of the statute of limitations. The trial court ruled in favor of respondent, based solely on reporting violations connected to a single letter. Appellant sought review. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that respondent's action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 91011. While respondent filed his original action within the limitations period, he did not specifically allege violations of the reporting statute until he filed his first amended complaint. The allegations set forth in respondent's amended complaint did not relate back to the original complaint for statute of limitations purposes.</SPAN></P>
