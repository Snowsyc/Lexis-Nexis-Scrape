</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a merchant who had a furniture cleaning business, lost his seller's permit after failing to pay a retail sales tax imposed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52(2). Defendant challenged his conviction for selling without a seller's permit on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional because it imposed a tax on certain services while others were exempt. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Where it was alleged that a statutory classification violated the Equal Protection Clause, it was required to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislature had abused its discretion. Because the statute involved a tax measure, the presumption of constitutionality was strong. The legislature had broad authority to determine classifications and exemptions, and its decision was sustainable if substantial differences existed between the occupations or services separately classified. The court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.52(2) was a tax that was based on rendering of services and was not tied to the incidental transfer of personal property by a serviceman. A rational basis existed for exempting certain professional services, such as those provided by doctors and lawyers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individual was injured in an accident on a city highway. The individual brought an action against the city and argued that the acts and omissions on the part of the city in the maintenance and repair of the highway were a proximate cause of the accident and resulting injuries. The lower court entered judgment in favor of the individual. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 81.15 and 895.43 were unconstitutional in that they created arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable classifications in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that both statutes dealt with victims of municipal torts and injuries. Yet the remedies available were determined solely upon the classifications, which were forced and artificial. The court found no logical reason why the State could afford to pay unlimited amounts of money if the injury resulted from an automobile accident with a municipal vehicle, but could only afford to pay up to $ 25,000 if the injury resulted from an automobile accident caused by a defective highway.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of five counts of soliciting prostitutes in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.32 (1975), two counts of pandering in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.33(1)(b) (1975), one count of battery in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.20 (1975), and one count of theft in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.20(1)(a) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.32 did not provide adequate notice of what conduct it prohibited. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that &sect; 944.32 was vague beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant also argued the &sect; 944.32 was unconstitutionally overbroad, chilling free speech. The court determined that the conduct proscribed by &sect; 944.32 was not conduct protected by the First Amendment. Defendant further contended that the sentencing provision &sect; 944.32 denied equal protection because a potential sentence for a solicitor was greater than that of a prostitute. The court found that it was reasonable for the State to punish a plan of repeated criminal conduct more heavily than it punished a single act. Additionally, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support each conviction. The court determined that the trier of fact, acting reasonably, could have been convinced of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by the evidence. Finally, the trial court properly sentenced defendant consecutively because the record and the presentence report justified a long term of confinement.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the taxpayer's sales were properly exempted under the occasional sales statute.&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.51(10)(a). The taxpayer's sale of assets was not subject to sales tax merely because the taxpayer held a seller's permit because the permit was held for a purpose unrelated to the sale of the assets. The Department was not entitled to rely on an arbitrary but certain rule only with respect to those taxpayers in businesses normally exempt from sales tax, and required it in such cases to make the case by case determination contemplated by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Wisconsin appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss a criminal complaint charging him with ill-treatment of a person confined to a hospital for the mentally ill in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.29(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a psychologist at a hospital for the mentally ill, punished a patient for stealing and regressive behavior by restricting her to her room and denying her telephone calls and visits until she attempted suicide. The trial court dismissed the complaint against him as insufficient. The court affirmed. Room restrictions and witholding job and telephone opportunities were not punishments that conformed to commonly held notions of abuse or ill-treatment. The State's argument that the term &quot;ill-treat&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; &sect; 940.29(3) should encompass acts of negligence in treating mental health patients based on professional standards of care would criminalize a common law civil malpractice suit. Absent clear legislative intent, the term &quot;ill-treat&quot; alone could not be the basis of finding that the legislature intended to apply criminal sanctions to an area traditionally encompassed by common law negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A child filed suit against his alleged father pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act. His mother did not file a paternity petition because she was barred by the five-year statute of limitations under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.195. When the alleged father's motion to dismiss was denied, he appealed. The court held that, although the copies of the summons and complaint served upon him were not authenticated as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.02(1), the alleged father was not misled by the lack of a case number on the documents, which primarily served to give him notice, and that a summons, as a notice, could contain minor inaccuracies that were not misleading, which did not void its service. The court found that paternity was a status or relation, which could be determined under the Act because there was no specific statutory procedure by which the child could independently establish his paternity, and that there was no applicable statute of limitations. The court concluded that a father had a legal obligation to support his legitimate children and that illegitimate children had the same common law right to parental support that legitimate children had.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim testified that she had met defendant at a bar when he asked her to dance. They went for a walk in a park and began kissing. When defendant started to caress her breasts, the victim stated that she wanted to return to the bar. Continued advances were rejected. When the victim began to walk away, defendant squeezed her throat and threatened to kill her until she stopped struggling and they had intercourse. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(4), alleging that it gave an unconstitutionally vague definition of consent. Defendant also contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(a) impermissibly shifted the burden of proof of consent on defendant. Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(4) defined consent in part as a freely given agreement to have sexual intercourse. The victim struggled and screamed repeatedly before complying with his demands. There was no doubt that he was given fair notice that it was not a freely given agreement as required by the statute. The evidence was sufficient to meet the State's burden of proving a lack of consent because the State established that the victim did not, by either her words or actions, freely agree to have intercourse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a corporation and an individual, appealed from orders of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) that temporarily restrained defendants from advertising and selling pirated materials, that held them in contempt for violating the orders, and that ordered the individual incarcerated for failing to pay costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The orders that restrained the defendants' actions were issued before notice and certification of the class action. Consequently, the defendants argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the orders. The court rejected the argument because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that a class action was appropriate, and there was no prejudice to the defendants or the absent class members by a delay in giving notice to the class members, particularly where delay in issuing the injunction could defeat the reason for it. The injunction did not violate the defendants' First Amendment rights because commercial speech relating to illegal pirating activities could be prohibited. To the extent that the injunction impacted the defendants' interstate activities the Commerce Clause was not violated because the governmental interest in stopping illegal trafficking of pirated materials outweighed the burden on interstate commerce. The order that directed the individual's incarceration for failing to pay costs was reversed however, because of the absence of a record of a hearing on his ability to pay which was required by due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the orders that temporarily restrained defendants from advertising or selling pirated materials, and that held them in contempt for violating the orders. However, the court reversed the order that incarcerated the individual and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the conclusion that a hearing on the record to establish the basis of the failure to pay costs was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment and order of the Circuit Court of Juneau County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of delivering a controlled substance, tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), contrary to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of delivering THC, a substance in marijuana. Defendant conceded that there was sufficient evidence to convict him of delivering marijuana. The court affirmed the conviction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.41(1)(b). The court found meritless his contention that the State was required to prove that he knew that the marijuana contained THC because the State was only required to prove that he knowingly delivered a controlled substance. Defendant did not have standing to argue that Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.11&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to an administrative body, the Controlled Substances Board (Wisconsin), because the legislature, not the Board, made marijuana or THC schedule I controlled substances and made their delivery a crime. The court, finding no compelling circumstances, did not review the sentence because defendant made no motion challenging it. The court could not find a miscarriage of justice or conclude that a new trial, in which an informant would have been allowed to testify that he would lie to avoid going to trial, would have produced a different result because his testimony was corroborated and the jury knew of his untrustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 7.08(2)(a) was unconstitutional because it allowed a candidate who had a formal legal surname to use that as a middle name as opposed to a candidate who did not have a formal legal surname, and ordered the Board to certify respondent candidate for inclusion on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A candidate was running for a non-partisan judicial office. He requested the Board's opinion as to whether his full name could appear on nomination papers. The Board found that Wis.

The candidate sought judicial review and the circuit court found &sect; 7.08(2)(a)&nbsp;unconstitutional and ordered the Board to certify the candidate for inclusion under his full name. The Board appealed and the court affirmed, holding that while technically, the wording of &sect; 7.08(2)(a) indicated that a candidate could not use both a complete first and middle name, the circuit court should have proceeded to discuss whether the candidate could still have had his full name placed on the ballot due to the particular circumstances of his individual situation. Therefore, the Board foreclosed the candidate the opportunity to present any mitigating circumstances why his name should have been placed in full on the ballot. The court remanded, although the election was over, ordering the Board to standardize its procedures for dealing with the candidate's attempt to have a non-conforming name placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that the classification applicable to the circumstances of the case comported with statutory provisions limiting the obligation to the child of an adjudicated father in a paternity proceeding to financial support. The court noted that the mother of the child had the statutory obligation of care and control and that &sect; 946.71(4) comported with that duty. The court determined that the substantial interests of the state in protecting children born out of wedlock were furthered in a manner that met equal protection requirements because there were substantial reasons for distinguishing the class. The court found that the statute clearly gave reasonable notice of proscribed conduct to persons bent on obedience of the law and was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant engineering company challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found plaintiff gas company 40 percent causally negligent in the construction of a natural gas pipeline, the engineering company 45 percent causally negligent, and defendant contractor 15 percent causally negligent. Defendant insurer was dismissed from the action. The gas company cross-appealed with regard to damages issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The engineering company was hired to perform engineering, design, and supervisory services on the 14-mile pipeline. The contractor was hired to build the pipeline. The gas company claimed that it had to replace parts of the pipeline before it was able to safely use it to transmit natural gas. Specifically, the gas company claimed that defendants failed to adequately support certain pipes. In contrast, defendants argued that the gas company was contributorily negligent in substituting inferior pipes and insulators for those recommended by the engineering company. The court held that the gas company's action was not barred by the six-year statute of limitations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.19(5) because the gas company had not been alerted to a defect for longer than six years. The court further held that the trial court did not err in denying the engineering company's motion for a nonsuit because there was no undisputed proof that the engineering company advised the gas company that the type of pipe and insulators chosen by the gas company were inadequate. The court also refused to adopt a new method for determining liability under the comparative negligence statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.045.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner attempted to develop a mobile home park. The trial court concluded that the owner was entitled to a declaratory judgment on the pleadings because no valid license had yet been issued by the town. On review, the court reversed the judgment. The court noted that the issuance of mobile home park licenses was governed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.058(5) and ordinances enacted pursuant to it. The court found that the trial court's interpretation of &sect; 66.058(5) was correct and reasonable and that the interpretation did not result in an unconstitutional deprivation of property. However, the court held that before the trial court could conclude that the owner had an approved application for a mobile home park license which was awaiting fulfillment of all of the conditions under which it was approved, there had to be undisputed allegations which established that the owner had submitted an application and plan for approval, the plan and specifications met the requirements of the town ordinance, and the town approved the plan. The court found that issues of fact could not be resolved on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and that the trial court was premature in granting judgment.</SPAN></P>

The assessment was affirmed by the Tax Appeals Commission and the taxpayer appealed. The circuit court affirmed the assessment and the taxpayer sought further review. The court affirmed the assessment, finding that the sales from the vending machines were not exempt from the tax under Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.54(9a) because the city was not the purchaser of the sales generated by the taxpayer's vending machines. The machines were located in city buildings but were used by the general public. The freight charges were also taxable pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 77.51(11)(a)(3) because the charges were included in the sale price for the items sold to the purchasers by the taxpayer. The court concluded that the sales tax was a nondiscriminatory one on purely local sales and did not violate the Commerce Clause in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that defendant failed to challenge the jury instruction in his post-conviction motion, and therefore, because the issue was not brought before the trial court, it was not preserved for appeal. The court also ruled that defendant made no showing that he was brought before the jury in handcuffs, except by his own statement. The court also held that there was no evidence whatsoever that any juror saw defendants or that defendant was in prejudiced in any way. The court held that, even if defendant were seen in handcuffs, outside the courtroom, it would not have necessarily prejudiced his trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant minor sought review of orders of the Circuit Court for Bayfield County (Wisconsin), which ordered legal custody of the minor to be transferred to respondent Bayfield County Department of Social Services (department), and to place the minor in foster care if he had one more &quot;unexcused absence&quot; from school.

The trial court found the minor in need of supervision for habitual truancy and ordered legal custody transferred to the department. After additional unexplained absences, the trial court ordered the department to place the minor in foster case if he had one more &quot;unexcused absence.&quot; The minor claimed &sect; 118.15, which made school attendance compulsory, was an unconstitutional bill of attainder, and there was insufficient evidence to support the finding custody should be transferred to the department. The court affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. Section 118.15 contained no provisions, which inflicted punishment for failure to attend school except after judicial proceedings, therefore, it was not unconstitutional as a bill of attainder. There was extensive testimony that if legal custody remained with the parents the minor would not be compelled to attend school, therefore, the order transferring custody was affirmed. The order that one more &quot;unexcused absence&quot; would lead to placement in foster care was vacated because the trial court made no determination as to what constituted an &quot;unexcused absence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant manufacturer appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which denied its motion to dismiss the complaints of plaintiffs, a driver, a passenger, and the administrator for two deceased passengers, and the parents of the first deceased passenger, to the extent they sought punitive damages in plaintiffs' two products liability and negligence actions against the manufacturer and co-defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver and passengers were burned, and two passengers died, when the car they were driving in, and which was made by the manufacturer, was hit by two other cars and its gas tank exploded. Plaintiffs filed two separate actions against defendants for products liability and negligence, and the manufacturer unsuccessfully filed a motion to dismiss the claims against it for punitive damages. The manufacturer appealed and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court. The court held that punitive damages could be awarded in a strict liability product liability suit and that the mere extension of the application of punitive damages was insufficient to reject consideration of punitive damages. The court ruled that, despite inconsistency with other portions of its opinion, precedent required it to hold that Wis. Stat. &sect; 895.04 did not allow punitive damages in a wrongful death action. A parent could be awarded punitive damages for the lost society and companionship of the parent's injured minor child, the court ruled. The court finally concluded that multiple awards of punitive damages for injuries caused by one product in a single accident was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed in part and affirmed in part the trial court's order. The court reversed the denial of the motion with respect to: plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages due to negligence only, the administrator's prayer for punitive damages for wrongful death, and the administrator and the parent's prayer for punitive damages arising out of injuries to the first deceased passenger. The court otherwise affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

He therefore, claimed that he was entitled to be placed on bail pending a new trial. In granting the inmate's request to be released on bail the court determined that because it had previously ordered a new trial for the inmate he was entitled to pretrial bail pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 969.01. The court stated that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 752.37 it had the power and authority to enforce its judgments and determinations and to exercise its jurisdiction. The court determined that the inmate's request for release on bail pending a new trial was a request to the court to enforce its judgment that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained and that he was entitled to a new trial. The court therefore ruled that because the inmate was entitled to a new trial, he was entitled to bail pending the new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a movie theater operator that was that was charged with showing obscene films. The first information charged defendant with three counts of violating the obscenity statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.21(1)(a), and a second information filed three months later charged defendant with 17 counts of violating the same statute. Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to all 20 counts and appealed the judgment of conviction challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 944.21(1)(a). The court affirmed the convictions as to the last 17 counts, but reversed and remanded the conviction as to the first 3 counts. The court held that a newly issued U.S. Supreme Court decision made it clear that the serious value test was not to be determined by contemporary community standards, and thus &sect; 944.21(1)(a) was no longer in compliance with first amendment standards. However, the trial court applied this correct standard for obscenity prosecution to the counts that were filed later, and thus defendant did not suffer any prejudice from the change in the law. Further, the trial court properly found that &sect; 944.21(1)(a) was constitutional. Thus, reversal of only the initial three charges was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on his plea of guilty to a charge of first-degree sexual assault. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 940.225(1)(d) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant and gave defendant adequate notice that his conduct was illegal. The court found that the issue of the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction could not be waived and that the court had a duty to consider the jurisdictional issue regardless of defendant's guilty plea. Defendant was without standing to raise the possibility that the statute might be used to prosecute the touching of various parts of the body, as defendant was only charged with touching an eight-year-old's vaginal area. The court declined to speculate as to the perimeters of the conduct &sect; 940.225 prohibited by referring to hypothetical examples. When raising issues on appeal, defendant was limited to the conduct actually charged in the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant picketer, who had died by the time the court was preparing its opinion, disputed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin), which found for respondent City of Racine, Wisconsin, in its forfeiture action against appellant and 63 other persons, whom the trial court had convicted of violating Racine, Wis., Code of Ordinances &sect; 25.54.030 (1975) due to their picketing a half-block area of the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The picketers, who were protesting the City's failure to reach new collective bargaining agreements after the prior agreements with the City policemen and firefighters expired, passed by a dry cleaning business owned by a City alderman. On appeal, the court held that appellant's death did not render the case moot. A resolution of the case would have an effect on an existing controversy. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that appellant violated &sect; 25.54.030 even though the picketers marched past other businesses and no labor dispute existed between the alderman and his employees. The court held that &sect; 25.54.030 did not violate either appellant's rights of free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I or the right to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Nor was &sect; 25.54.030 unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Because &sect; 25.54.030 clearly applied to the actions undertaken by appellant, he had no standing to challenge the ordinance as vague as to others. The regulation of conduct by the ordinance was permissible in light of the important public interest to be advanced, i.e., preventing economic coercion of public officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment and the order denying appellant's post-trial motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The judgment held that defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.01(2), which proscribed disorderly conduct. The judgment also held that &sect; 947.01(2) was facially unconstitutional in violation of the First Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with five counts of disorderly conduct for making harassing, threatening, and annoying phone calls to his wife and her relatives. Section 947.01(2) proscribed making a telephone call with intent to annoy another, whether or not conversation ensued. The State conceded on appeal that defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 947.01(2) because &sect; 947.01(2) involved federal and state constitutional free speech rights. The court noted that free speech rights had to be weighed against the State's legitimate regulatory power. Statutes were not to be held invalid unless they were not readily subject to a narrowing construction. The court found that the operative words &quot;intent to annoy&quot; were capable of interpretations that would chill legitimate free speech activities. The deterrent effect on legitimate expression was real and substantial. Section 947.01(2) was facially overbroad and was not subject to narrow tailoring. Because the court determined that &sect; 947.01(2) was overly broad, it did not reach the vagueness issue. There was no error.</SPAN></P>

When the register was opened, the other man pulled a silver gun. The two men cleaned out the registers. They also took bank bags from the safe, one of which was torn. The State introduced evidence of a robbery at a nearby convenience store days earlier. The modus operandi (MO) was virtually identical to the pantry store robbery. A torn bank bag was seized from defendant's bedroom. His father testified that he found the bag and gave it to defendant years earlier. In rebuttal, the State introduced proof that credit cards stolen in a recent pharmacy robbery were found in the seized bag. Defendant argued that the other crimes evidence was admitted in error. The court disagreed. Evidence of a similar MO in the convenience store robbery was probative of the pantry store robber's identity and admissible under Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.04(2). The probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. While the bag and credit cards were inadmissible in the State's case in chief, they were properly admitted in rebuttal to refute defense testimony as to the innocent origins of the bag and to establish defendant's identity as the robber.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged after selling a fisher to an undercover agent. The court rejected defendant's entrapment argument. The facts did not support an inference that the agent induced defendant to commit the crime. The agent stated that he would be interested in the fisher that defendant had, but never said he wanted to buy it before defendant offered to sell the fisher. The friendship between the agent and defendant may have made defendant unwary in selling the fisher, but did not establish inducement. The court rejected defendant's constitutionality challenge to Wis. Stat. &sect; 29.48(1). Defendant lacked standing to make arguments concerning overbreadth, vagueness, and equal protection through the use of hypotheticals. The fact that the jury acquitted defendant of selling a bear fur to the agent did not make his conviction inconsistent. The bear fur was clearly a separate transaction in which the jury could have concluded that defendant was induced to sell. The trial court did not err in refusing to grant a continuance. There was no connection between a press release detailing a similar crime and defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant railroad challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which affirmed respondent department of revenue's assessment for ad valorem tax upon the railroad operating property. The railroad contested the department's total assessment, claiming that the assessment, which was made under Wis. Stat. &sect; 76.07(3), should have been substantially less.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">To assess the railroad's property tax, the department of revenue calculated the fair market value of the railroad operating property by use of a formula that combined three methods, the capitalized income approach, the cost approach, and the stock and debt approach, and based on the opinions of five appraisers. The trial court affirmed the department's assessment for the ad valorem tax upon the railroad operating property. The court reversed and required the department to recalculate the tax assessment. The department should have accepted the railroad's accounting method when making the assessment of the railroad's property where the railroad had consistently used a generally accepted method of accounting for legitimate business purposes and not as a device to avoid taxation. The railroad's accounting procedure for rails and ties accurately represented the fact that rails and ties were constantly replaced from wear. The cost approach, when applied to a railroad's operating property for the purpose of determining an ad valorem tax, was of such little value that its continued use was not justified because the original cost of a railroad had little relation to its present value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to refer the cause to the department of revenue to recalculate the ad valorem tax assessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Madison, Wis., Gen. Ordinance &sect; 23.44(2) required retail outlets in the city selling milk in non-refillable containers equal to or greater than one gallon, also to offer for sale milk in returnable containers in sufficient quantities. The producers contended that the ordinance conflicted with state statutes and regulations and therefore violated Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3, and that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court concluded that the producers were not entitled to a temporary injunction because there was little chance of success on the merits. The city was free to issue the ordinance, pursuant to its power under Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.11(5). The ordinance was not at cross purposes with the regulations, and there was no express withdrawal of the power and no legislation or administrative rules that were logically inconsistent with the city's action. While no definition of &quot;sufficient quantities&quot; appeared in the ordinance, the ordinance's mandate was not so vague to prevent an ordinary retailer from determining what was required of him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, 14 life insurance companies, seven life insurance agents, and the National Association of Life Underwriters, appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which denied plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction enjoining defendants, the State Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and its Commissioner, from enforcing Wis. Adm. Code &sect; Ins. 2.14(4)(a) while they sought an order declaring the statute invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner promulgated Wis. Adm. Code &sect; Ins. 2.14(4)(a), which required insurance companies to give life insurance prospects the &quot;Wisconsin Buyer's Guide to Life Insurance&quot; and a preliminary policy summary, prior to payment, and a policy summary upon delivery of the policy. Plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought an injunction prohibiting its enforcement during the pendency of their action for declaratory relief. Plaintiffs appealed, and the court reversed the lower court and remanded the matter. The court concluded that plaintiffs demonstrated probable success on the merits that the Commissioner did not comply with statutory procedure in making the rule, and that the Commissioner exceeded his authority by contradicting the purpose of the insurance laws by requiring the dissemination of information that might actually mislead consumers. The court found that plaintiffs showed that life insurance policies with a low surrender cost index did not always cost the least when the insured kept his policy until his death. The court noted that the statute abandoned cautionary language formerly associated with the surrender cost index which stated that the index could not be blindly relied on.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower court and remanded the cause for a trial on the merits consistent with the court's opinion. The court ordered the lower court to enjoin enforcement of Wis. Adm. Code &sect; Ins. 2.14(4)(a) to the extent that it required distribution of the &quot;Wisconsin Buyer's Guide to Life Insurance&quot; and a preliminary policy summary.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted and sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the complaint, bindover and conviction because the testimony of certain witnesses was false and perjured. The court found that the district attorney threatened to file additional charges against one witness should he have refused to testify. This threat had not related to obtaining a specific version of the facts from the witness, but went only towards obtaining the presence and testimony of the witness at trial and as such was not impermissible. The court further rejected defendant's argument that the complaint was insufficient in that it was based on perjured statements made by an unreliable informant. Admissions of criminal activity were imbued with sufficient credibility to support a finding of probable cause because such statements were contrary to the declarant's penal interest. The complaint was based on statements that were against the penal interest of the informant since they connected him with the commission of a felony.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that the prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had actual knowledge of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the very early morning hours, undercover policemen observed appellant talking to several male pedestrians and two males in parked cars. When one officer approached her and asked what she was doing, she looked at him and laughed, but gave no explanation. On appeal, the court pointed out that a vagrancy statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. 947.02, that had been declared unconstitutionally vague was substantively different from &sect; 106.31(1)(g). The court held that fair notice was given regarding the type of activity proscribed by &sect; 106.31(1)(g). The specific requirements of &sect; 106.31(1)(g) insured that it could not be used by police to arbitrarily and erratically arrest citizens. Nor was &sect; 106.31(1)(g) overbroad. Its language was specific enough to prevent government interference with citizens' recognized freedoms. It did not affect people engaging in innocent activities. The court held that &sect; 106.31(1)(g) was constitutional as applied to the facts of the case. The court pointed out that actions for violations of municipal ordinances were civil prosecutions, not criminal. As such, the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find a violation of &sect; 106.31(1)(g) by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The alleged spouse of the decedent brought a wrongful death action against the insurer. The trial court denied the insurer's motion for summary judgment. The insurer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the alleged spouse was the decedent's spouse within the meaning of the wrongful death statute because public policy favored upholding a marriage attacked as void by a third party like the insurer here as surely as it favored upholding a marriage attacked by a party to that marriage. The court reasoned that the alleged spouse was the surviving spouse of the decedent because her first marriage, the only legal impediment to the instant marriage, was in fact dissolved by a divorce judgment that became final six months after the marriage at issue.</SPAN></P>

The court construed the protective placement statutes and concluded that the trial court had failed to articulate its findings in a manner that permitted the court to determine the sufficiency of the evidence. Without the aid of specific findings of fact by the trial court the reviewing court was unable to find support for the trial court's conclusions. The court was unable to decide whether the statutory requirements under Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.45 were satisfied. Accordingly, the court determined that it was necessary to remand the case to resolve the ambiguities. The court declined to decide any of the constitutional issues raised in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to a complaint of a disturbance, two deputy sheriffs went to defendant's mother's residence. She told them that she and defendant had been in an argument and that the argument had calmed down but that she wanted defendant out of the residence. When defendant appeared, he asked the deputies to give him a ride because he had no means of transportation. The deputies agreed and told defendant that it was department policy to pat down anyone given a ride in a squad car to make sure that he was not armed. Defendant protested and stepped away, but one of the deputies grabbed defendant, pushed him against the car, patted him down, and found a pipe and marijuana. Defendant was arrested. The court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that the evidence should have been suppressed. The deputy acted unreasonably because he had no reason to believe his safety or the safety of another was jeopardized by any of defendant's conduct, and such reason was necessary to enable him to make a warrantless search of defendant. The search was not in conformity with Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.10(5) or (6) and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Wis. Const. art. 1, &sect;11.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed asserting, among other things, that the recent enactment of the statute which prohibited sexual assault, Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225, as to his acts, implicitly repealed Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.17. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225 dealt with assaults, and not with perversion. Section 940.225 was in a chapter of the statutes entitled &quot;Crimes Against Life and Bodily Security.&quot; Sexual assaults were the result of aggression, not perversion. Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.17 was in a chapter of the statutes entitled &quot;Crimes Against Sexual Morality.&quot; Perversion with or without consent was prosecutable and the statute was a legislative reaction to perceived societal mores regarding sex. The two statutes dealt with some of the same parts of the human anatomy, but to suggest that the enactment of the statute prohibiting sexual assaults was in reality the enactment of a statute dealing with sexual perversion was unrealistic.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed that finding. The court held that the employee was entitled to benefits under Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.03(1)(c). The court explained that an amendment to that statute, which allowed benefits for any employe going between an employer's designated parking lot and the employer's work premises, was not intended to be limited to employees who actually made use of the parking lot.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a sergeant told the deputy to perform a breathalizer test on an individual the deputy called a lieutenant complaining of the sergeant's order. The sergeant filed a complaint against the deputy, alleging a Rule 1.03 violation. The deputy also told a female dispatcher to &quot;get the fuck&quot; out of the deputies' lounge. Another complaint was filed against the deputy, alleging violations of Rules 1.05 and 4.14. A grievance committee ordered the deputy dismissed. The trial court's affirmed the grievance committee's decision. The court held that the deputy had fair notice that his challenged conduct was prohibited by Rules 1.03, 1.05, 4.14. Further, the evidence showed that the deputy's conduct was &quot;hard core.&quot; Thus, the deputy did not have standing to challenge Rules 1.03, 1.05, 4.14 as vague. Moreover, the deputy's statement to the dispatcher did not express an idea that was linked to First Amendment values. Any value that the statement might have had was outweighed by the sheriff department's need for respect of fellow employees. Thus, the deputy did not have standing to challenge Rules 1.05 and 4.14 as overbroad because his statement was not protected by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant physician sought review of the order of the Circuit Court of Crawford County (Wisconsin), denying the physician's motion for summary judgment, in a medical malpractice claim filed by respondent, a patient upon whom the physician had performed a hernia repair operation 21 years before the suit was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient discovered through exploratory surgery that he was permanently sterile due to the severance of his vasa. His action was commenced 21 years after the severance of his vasa, and one year after his discovery of that fact. The court reversed the trial court's order and directed that summary judgment be granted in favor of the physician. It reasoned that in medical malpractice cases, the claim accrues at the time the negligent act occurs with accompanying injury. The court held that pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 893.205, 893.14, 893.33, the patient had until one year after his 18th birthday to bring his action against the physician, and that the fact that until his exploratory surgery to discover the reason for his infertility he had no knowledge of his injury, at which time the statute of limitations had destroyed his claim, had no legal significance. The court also held that neither Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, nor the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, was offended by the application of the statute of limitations to the patient's claim.</SPAN></P>

On December 2, 1977, the Trial Court sentenced Wolter to the Wisconsin state prison for an indeterminate term not to exceed five years, stayed the execution of the sentence, and placed Wolter on probation for five years, the first year of which was to be served pursuant to sec. 973.09(4), Stats.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 289.02(5), and Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.20(1)(b) and (3)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his wife as officers of the construction corporation had obtained a construction loan from the bank for a 14-unit apartment building. Defendant had received draws to pay subcontractors, which were not fully paid. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.20(1)(b) was applicable to defendant as owner of the corporation and prime contractor. The record revealed the funds were used to pay other corporate debts in violation of the construction contract. The crime of theft by contractor was created in Wis. Stat. &sect; 289.02(5), and Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.20 was only the conduit through which the crime was processed. Wis. Stat. 289.02(5) was not void for vagueness because it gave fair notice and proper standards for adjudication. The court found that refusal of defendant to deliver any money that was in his possession or custody as trustee, and upon demand of the person entitled to receive it was prima facie evidence of intent to convert the money for defendant's own use. Failure of defendant's counsel to object to questioning by the trial judge was waived because the objection to judicial misconduct was not timely made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village adopted an ordinance which annexed certain noncontiguous land owned by it. The land was located in the town. The town filed suit against the village and sought a declaration that the annexation ordinance was unconstitutional, unlawful, and ultra vires. The trial court denied the village's motion to dismiss the action. The village appealed, contending that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide the case because the state attorney general had not been served within 60 days of the commencement of the action pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.02(1). The village also contended that the town had no standing to file suit and that it had failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted. The court held that (1) the 60 day service requirement of &sect; 801.02(1) did not apply to the action because the attorney general was not required to be made a party to the action by Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11); (2) the town had standing to sue because it was an interested party authorized to test the validity of the annexation ordinance; and (3) the town's allegation that the village's ordinance was unlawful was sufficient to state a cause of action for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
