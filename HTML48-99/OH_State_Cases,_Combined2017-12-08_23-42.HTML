<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for offenses of truck overweight, operating a commercial vehicle without a valid highway use permit, and operating an unregistered motor vehicle in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5511.04, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5728.04, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4503.11. Defendants sought review and contended that the trial court committed prejudicial error by refusing to grant their request for a trial by jury. Pursuant to Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5, the right of trial by jury was inviolate. Further, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.17, at any trial for the violation of any statute or ordinance, except in cases where the penalty had not exceeded a fine of $ 100, the accused had the right to be tried by a jury. The court held that the right to jury trial was a substantive right that was subject to reasonable regulation. The court determined that the trial by jury was the normal and preferable mode of disposing of issues. The court held that the trial court's action of requiring an advance deposit of jury fees in the criminal action was not required and was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed on the ground that &sect; 1505.01 was inoperative and void for uncertainty of meaning. The court rejected that argument and affirmed. The court found that &sect; 1505.01, which required that a building permit be obtained before proceeding with excavation or certain other work of any dwelling or appurtenant structure, was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also found that (1) defendant's work in question was not beyond the reach of &sect; 1505.01; and (2) the legitimate inference that defendant did not have a permit was not against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee of defendant former employer brought an action appealing a denial by the Industrial Commission of a review of a decision of the Regional Board of Review affirming the Bureau of Workers' Compensation's denial of the employee's claim for an occupational disease. The Court of Common Pleas of Portage County (Ohio) granted the former employer's motion to dismiss. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had worked for less than a year as a foundry worker for the former employer. Thereafter, the employee worked as a lathe operator for another employer until he became ill with granulomas pneumoconiosis silicosis. The employee was later examined by a physician for the Bureau of Workers' Compensation who determined that he was vocationally disabled as a result of exposure to hazardous substances on the job sites of either employer or both. The employee filed a claim for an occupational disease with the Bureau. The claim was disallowed. The Regional Board of Review affirmed, and the Industrial Commission denied review of the affirmance. The trial court granted the former employer's motion to dismiss on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction because the employee's employment with the former employer did not qualify him to recover for the injury, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.68. The court affirmed on the ground that the version of &sect; 4123.68 applicable to the employee's claim required that a worker have three years' exposure to silica dust, asbestos or coal dust prior to the worker's disability from silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' pneumoconiosis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the former employer.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the trial, the State moved in limine to exclude any testimony of defendant's expert witness. Defendant called the witness to testify, but the trial court granted the State's motion. The witness had no personal knowledge of the particular instrument used in the administration of a breath test given to defendant on the date in question. The trial court found that the testimony would have related, generally, to the reliability of that type of instrument and that it had to be excluded upon the authority of an unreported case. The court rejected the implication of the unreported case that the accused was not entitled to offer evidence as to the scientific unreliability of the breath test results from a certain type of instrument. Defendant had the right in defending himself to present general expert testimony to offset the presumptive expert testimony provided for by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(B). The State was improperly relieved of its constitutional duty to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on the element of the offense as to whether he was under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance in question regulated the usage of streets in the village. Appellee truck owners argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it prohibited the operation of trucks over a certain weight on all the streets of the village excepting operations for loading or unloading at a residence, place of business, or industry in the village or traveling to or from a residence, place of business, or industry where such trucks were registered or hired. The court agreed and held that as worded the ordinance discriminated against individuals or entities that did not store their bus, truck, trailer, or semi-trailer on a local street. The court concluded that the classification was unreasonable because it was based upon a distinction between persons housing trucks within the village and persons whose trucks were not housed within the village.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties each sought a divorce and the matter was heavily litigated. Each party sought custody of the couple's minor child. The trial court awarded custody, child support, six months of alimony, and attorneys' fees as alimony to the mother. The father appealed. The court reversed the trial court and remanded. The father was denied due process in that the trial court failed to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law upon the father's request. The father was also erroneously denied his right to closing argument. The trial court's failure to make findings of fact pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 52 prejudiced the father on appeal and was reversible error. Because of the voluminous litigation, the father should have been permitted a closing summation. He did not waive the right by failing to request a closing argument. The lack of a record from the underlying proceeding hampered the court in its evaluation of other of the father's assignments of error. The trial court was instructed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, if requested, on remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), which prohibited operation of a motor vehicle with a breath alcohol concentration at or in excess of ten-hundredths of one gram by weight of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, alleging that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was unconstitutional. The trial court overruled his motion and defendant entered a plea of no-contest. Defendant sought review and the court found no error. The court held that the language of &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was drawn clearly and precisely and the fact that an individual was not equipped with a Breathalyzer machine did not make the statute vague. Further, the question of whether the breathalyzer machine measured accurately and whether defendant's breath measured at ten-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of his breath at the time he was driving were fact questions and had no bearing on the clarity of the statute. The court found that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) did not create an unconstitutional presumption of driving under the influence because it instead created a separate offense from &sect; 4511.19(A)(1), (2), and (3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas for Summit County (Ohio), which compelled defendant to provide a handwriting exemplar and convicted defendant upon his plea of no contest to one count of uttering. Defendant claimed that his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights were violated, that the common pleas court misused its contempt powers, and that he was denied a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on three counts of uttering a forged instrument and he was ordered to provide a handwriting exemplar. Defendant refused unless his attorney was present. Defendant then appeared with counsel and defendant again refused. The common pleas court found defendant in contempt, which was affirmed on appeal. Defendant filed a motion for discharge for failure to provide a speedy trial. On review the court found no error. The court noted that the issues surrounding the contempt orders were raised, or could have been raised, on the appeal of those orders. Therefore, that judgment was res judicata as to all issues raised except defendant's speedy trial arguments. A plea of no contest admitted the allegations in the indictment and the court could not weigh the evidence. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(D) provided that the time within which trial might be had would be extended by any delay occasioned by improper acts of defendant. Defendant's refusal to submit a handwriting exemplar, in contempt of the common pleas court's orders, was such an improper act resulting in delay and the provisions of &sect; 2945.72(D) extended the time for trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the common pleas court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's position was that the ordinance was necessary to protect against sick leave abuses and that it had &quot;granted&quot; sick leave benefits to employees for injuries or illnesses resulting from the performance of their duties off the job but only while the employee was in the sole employ of the city, and sick leave had not been &quot;granted&quot; for injuries or illnesses incurred in outside employment.

The court noted that the employee failed to argue that he was not a probationary employee. The court explained that Ohio Rev.

Such removal was within the employer's discretion, the court explained, and not subject to administrative or judicial review. The employee's argument was limited to an assertion that he performed the same duties for 90 days, and the court affirmed the dismissal of his appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital filed a claim against the patient and her husband, seeking to collect a balance due for serviced rendered to the patient. The exhibit attached to the complaint bore no identification of the party or parties from whom the balance was due. When the hospital moved for summary judgment, there was no evidence before the trial court that the husband was the husband of the patient, so as to possibly be responsible for her debts. The husband-wife relationship was not factually established. The affidavits in behalf of the husband in his motion for partial summary judgment specifically stated that at the time services were rendered to the patient, the hospital looked solely to the insurance and credit of the patient as the source of the payment. The court held that in the absence of any counter affidavit raising a factual dispute in this regard, there was no genuine issue of material fact pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 56 and summary judgment as to the husband's non-liability or responsibility for payment should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of conviction by the Court of Common Pleas of Madison County (Ohio) finding defendant guilty of possession of marijuana in an amount equal to, or exceeding, three times the bulk amount in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was cultivating marijuana in his backyard, was found in possession of 1298 grams of marijuana. The court held that as &sect; 2925.03(A)(6) was aimed at illicit drug traffic and not users, the personal use defense of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(F) applied to defendant's charge of possession although the amount of marijuana exceeded three times bulk amount. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(3), (6), and (F) were not unconstitutionally vague. The observations from the neighbor's window by the police who went to the neighbor's residence with the express purpose of viewing defendant's property, did not violate defendant's legitimate expectation of privacy. Accordingly, there was probable cause to issue a search warrant. The plant stalks should not have been included in determining whether the statutory threshold of 600 grams had been exceeded. A review of the record showed that there was no evidence of a persuasive nature indicating that there had been any alternations or tampering of the marijuana plant evidence.</SPAN></P>

The superintendent refused to supply the information and denied the request for home instruction. Thereafter, school officials filed a complaint alleging the children were neglected. The lower court found the parents neglected their children and the parents appealed. The court reversed and remanded the decision. The court found that the superintendent had denied the parents' request because the mother was not a certified teacher and this issue was not raised until trial. Therefore, the court found that the parents were not specifically apprised of the charges against them nor were they informed of what the minimum requirements for home instruction would have been. The court held that the superintendent was under a duty to provide that information to the parents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some nine years after he retired, the widow's husband died from silicosis that resulted from his job related exposure to airborne particles. The widow filed a claim for death benefits some 13 months after her husband died. The Industrial Commission denied the widow's claim as untimely under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.68. The trial court dismissed the widow's claim finding that it lacked jurisdiction because the claim was untimely. On appeal, the court held that the widow's claim was timely under Ohio Rev.

The court also held that the eight-year limitations period in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.68 violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court reasoned that the only basis for imposing the limitation was administrative ease and that the length of time between the last injurious exposure and the date of death had little if any value in establishing a causal connection between employment-related exposure and silicosis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the landowners purchased their adjacent parcels of property, both parcels were zoned single-family residential.

The city ultimately refused to change the use classification, and the landowners filed an action against the city to declare the zoning classification unconstitutional as applied to their land. The common pleas court declared the existing zoning classification unconstitutional as applied and enjoined the city from interfering with the landowners' use of the property consistent with an office building classification. The court affirmed, holding that the use classification could not be constitutionally applied to the landowners' property because the single-family residential classification did not meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on the ground that it did not bear any reasonable relation to protection of the health, welfare, or safety of the citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.23 was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court found that a vague statute was one which either forbade or required the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. As the statute in question was written, the court found that it provided an ascertainable standard of guilt and gave notice as to precisely what conduct was criminally proscribed. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in overruling his Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 motion for acquittal. The court found the only witnesses called to testify at the hearing on the motion were called by the State, and reasonable minds could reach different conclusions as to whether each material element of the crime had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were charged with the crime of prostitution, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.25, which provided that no person shall engage in sexual activity for hire. The alleged activities took place in private in massage parlors with police officers; their intent was allegedly to collect evidence in order to convict defendants of the crime. After a joint trial, defendants were convicted as charged. Upon review, the court reversed the judgment. The court rejected all but one of defendants' contentions: that the police officers were accomplices under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03, and thus their uncorroborated testimony as to the private acts failed to tend to connect defendants with the offense and failed to tend to identify the accused defendants as guilty actors. Therefore, the trial court erred in finding defendants guilty on the basis of the uncorroborated testimony of the participating accomplices.</SPAN></P>

The applicant filed an action seeking the issuance of a new permit, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The applicant sought review, and the court held that: (1) the discrepancy in the time within which the applicant had to commence work was irrelevant because the work was not completed within the maximum time permitted under &sect; 150.402; (2) the ordinance did not violate Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.15 because that statute, allowing for the substitution of nonconforming uses, did not contemplate complete removal and replacement; and (3) the use violated a police regulation, as well as a zoning ordinance, which was not subject to &sect; 713.15.</SPAN></P>

The owner of the auto-wrecking yard filed an amended answer that added a counterclaim against new parties consisting of the county board, its commissioners, the planning and zoning commission, and the county sheriff. The owner asserted that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and an unlawful taking of his property. The county zoning inspector argued that the issue of the alleged illegality of the ordinance was barred by res judicata because of a prior judgment 25 years before. The court agreed and affirmed the injunctive relief granted to the county zoning inspector. The court held that a judgment for or against a governmental body, such as a municipal corporation, was binding and conclusive as res judicata on all residents, citizens, and taxpayers with respect to all matters of general public interest that were adjudicated or all matters that might properly have been adjudicated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the common pleas court order dismissing all of the indictments against defendants based on the State's violation of speedy trial statutes. The court affirmed. It first rejected the State's claim that the speedy trial statutes were unconstitutional, declining to consider the claim at all because it was not raised in the common pleas court. The court also rejected a claim that the running of the 270-day period had been tolled by conduct chargeable to the defense. The court found that the period of time involved greatly exceeded 270 days and that the State's claims of tolling, based on vague references to &quot;conversations&quot; between the court, the prosecutor, and defense counsel, on unrecorded &quot;understandings,&quot; or to possible representations (and misrepresentations) to the trial court, none of which affirmatively appeared in the trial court's journal entries, were so greatly deficient as an excuse for the elapse of more than 618 days or as an after-the-fact justification for the State's conduct that further consideration was unnecessary.

The question was whether the judges' appropriation requests were reasonable or whether in so requesting they abused the court's discretion. The court held that the judges justified their monetary requests with facts sufficient to make a prima facie showing that those requests were reasonably necessary to meet the courts' fiscal needs and to expedite court business. The court held that the commissioners did not made an affirmative showing that the request was unreasonably great or arbitrarily demanded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was traveling at a rate of 38 miles per hour on a road in the city.

Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.65(B) provided that a through highway had to have a continuous length of more than one mile between any two of the limits indicated in the statute. The portion of the road on which defendant was speeding was less than one mile long. Thus, it was not a through highway, and the prima facie speed limit of 35 miles per hour did not apply.

In applying the statute, one simply determined if any of the three limits set forth therein arose in any portion of the road that was a mile or less in length from the occurrence of a prior limit.

On appeal, the village argued that attorney fees were not proper because no public benefit was conferred as the only change in the ordinance was to make it prospective and there was no proof of the nature of the legal services provided. The court found that pursuant to the general rule in Ohio, the prevailing party in a lawsuit was not entitled to attorney fees unless there was a statutory provision authorizing the award or the party against whom the fees were taxed was found to have acted in bad faith.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision from the Common Pleas Court of the County of Summit (Ohio), which denied defendant's requests to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis of newly discovered evidence. Defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to corrupt another with drugs and to corrupting another with drugs. On remand because of erroneous sentencing, defendant sought to withdraw the plea in part because of ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four attorneys represented defendant, the first at the initial phase, a second during the guilty plea, a third on one appeal, and a fourth on the current appeal. The new evidence claim related to an affidavit provided by the victim and a deposition by the second attorney. On appeal for the third time, the court affirmed. First, the deposition was not filed with the trial court and was not a part of the record. The conclusory affidavit by the victim stated that she was not supplied drugs by defendant that were intended to cause harm and that she was not drug dependent. It could not have been ineffective assistance to raise the &quot;new&quot; evidence because the affidavit would not have exonerated defendant. It stated nothing about the age of the victim and did not deny that defendant gave drugs to the victim. Also, a claim in the affidavit that defendant had done nothing offensive did not create a prosecutorial misconduct issue. Moreover, defendant's claims were barred by res judicata by the failure to raise his claims before.</SPAN></P>

In addition, defendant alleged that the trial court erred in denying the petition before the prosecutor replied to the petition. The court held that because an action for post-conviction relief was a civil proceeding, the appointment of counsel was neither a constitutional nor a statutory requirement. The court also held that an evidentiary hearing on the petition was not warranted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21(C), (E) because defendant's petition made only broad assertions without further demonstration of prejudice. With respect to defendant's assertion regarding the prosecutor's failure to reply, the court held that the prosecutor failed to respond within the time allowed under Ohio Rev.

Defendant asserted, among other things, that the statute was discriminatory and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's failure to pay to register was undisputed. She objected to paying for the statutorily required license because she asserted that the applicable statute was unconstitutional. At trial on the charges, defendant was found guilty. She appealed. The court affirmed. It found that a similarly decided case held that a per capita tax on dogs was not unconstitutional. Also, the Ohio General Assembly chose to enact various legislative measures concerning dogs, including requirements for licensing them. The presumption was that such legislation was constitutional. No clear and convincing evidence was presented in defendant's case as required to rebut the presumption of the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 955.21, or to rebut the presumption of a valid purpose, as well as a rational basis, for the classification of dogs in other provisions. Thus, defendant was not denied equal protection under the law. Since the statute was constitutional and the violations admitted, defendant's other assertions of error were not prejudicial to defendant or reversible error.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found him to be a mentally ill person and the request for discharge was therefore denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. All medical testimony was that appellant suffered from schizophrenia, but that such condition was in remission. In addition, most of the medical testimony, if not all was to the effect that appellant, in order to maintain his present condition had continue to take medication and must also receive therapy treatments. The difference in the procedure in the involuntary commitment of those committed through civil process and those committed after having been found not guilty by reason of insanity did not amount a denial of equal protection of the law.

Apparently the sentencing court summarily determined him to be a repeat offender and therefore conclusively barred from conditional probation. This was prejudicial error requiring remand.

While represented during trial, he pled guilty to carrying a concealed weapon and aggravated assault. He was ordered to serve his sentences consecutively. He did not directly appeal his convictions. About six months after his guilty plea, he filed a petition for post-conviction relief without the help of counsel. He alleged that he was denied his right to effective representation at trial, that he was denied a fair trial, that he was convicted in violation of double jeopardy and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A), and that he was sentenced with multiple punishments for one offense. Because his petition lacked a supporting affidavit and other documentary evidence and because his memorandum attached to the petition was unverified, the trial court summarily denied the petition. The court held that under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant leased a building in an area zoned Community Business District, but filed a zoning permit application proposing that he be allowed to use the property as a body shop and retail sales. The administrator denied the application and the board upheld the decision on appeal. On review, the trial court reversed the decision and defendants sought review. The court found reversible error. Although a court could find an administrative ruling to be illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by a preponderance of substantial reliable and probative evidence, it could not substitute its judgment for that of an agency. Upon reviewing the record, the court found that both the decision of the board and the decision of the trial court resulted from a thorough reading of zoning resolutions. Because the court had before it two interpretations of the same zoning statutes by two separate authorities and because it did not find that the decision of the board was so arbitrary or unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion, the court held that the trial court had improperly substituted its reasoning for that of the board, a practice prohibited by &sect; 2506.04.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was terminated from her position at a public board meeting. The employee filed an appeal with the trial court and was reinstated. The board notified the employee that it intended to later terminate her and suspended her without pay pending termination. Board hearings were held to determine if grounds existed for the employee's termination and the employee was later notified by letter that she was terminated. The employee appealed and the cases were consolidated. In reversing and remanding the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court erred. The court found that the board failed to establish by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence that the employee was guilty of the charges that her termination was based on. The court noted that the employee's prior performance appraisals indicated she performed her duties in a competent manner. The court concluded that the trial court's initial determination was not res judicata as to the employee's termination because it was specifically noted in the order that the ruling was not a determination on the merits and sufficiency of the underlying evidence for the termination.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor performed a tubal ligation on the patient in 1979 to prevent further pregnancies. In 1981, the patient learned that she was pregnant again. In 1982, after the patient delivered the baby, it was discovered that her left fallopian tube appeared to be intact. Shortly thereafter the patient brought a malpractice action against the doctor, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the doctor. The trial court held that the action was untimely under &sect; 2305.11(A), applying the rule that a cause of action for malpractice accrued, at the latest, when the physician-patient relationship terminated. On review, the court found reversible error. Although the decision had not yet been handed down when the trial court entered its judgment, the court followed its holding in a prior case that a cause of action for medical malpractice accrued and the statute of limitations commenced to run when the patient discovered, or, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have discovered, the resulting injury. Therefore, applying the new rule the court held that the action was timely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city brought an action against defendant landlord, seeking to recover unpaid rental permit fees required under the city housing code. The landlord filed a counterclaim seeking to recover the permit fees he previously paid. The landlord challenged an order of the Athens County Municipal Court (Ohio), which entered summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord contended in his counterclaim that he was entitled to recover the permit fees previously paid because the housing code was unconstitutional, or in the alternative that the permit fees created a contract entitling him to an annual inspection. The only questions presented for review on appeal were whether the city housing code was legal, and whether its enforcement was proper? The court answered both questions in the affirmative. The court determined that the housing code was not in conflict with state statutes. The court reasoned that the housing code met the special needs of a college town where there were many student rental units. The court further determined that the challenged regulation was expressly permitted in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.29(A) allowed the city to regulate the use of buildings used for human occupancy. The court held that even if the landlord was entitled to an inspection under a contract theory, that he raised no issue of damages and offered no explanation of how he was injured by the failure of the city to inspect. The court concluded that there was no search in this case, and hence, no issue of the constitutionality of a search was raised.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that all the funds requested by the judge were reasonable except those pertaining to the bureau of support. The bureau did not perform judicial acts and thus was not related to the inherent judicial power of the judge's court. However, although a writ of mandamus would have been appropriate, the court denied the writ, stating that the proper method for solving problems between the various branches of the government was to reach a settlement by negotiation and compromise, not by imposing a resolution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was distributing copies of a weekly newspaper when she was warned about blocking the sidewalk in front of a restaurant. She moved to a different location and continued her activities. At this second spot, she was cited and charged with violating &sect; 509.03(c), but the trial court sustained a motion finding that an application of the First Amendment could invalidate the statute if no obstruction were shown to have existed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that there was more than sufficient probable cause permitting the City to have invoked the statute and that the trial court rushed by that issue in an effort to achieve a finding on the broader free speech aspect of the case. In doing so, the trial court rendered what amounted to a summary judgment, thereby precluding the City from its day in court. The court also found the enforcement of &sect; 509.03(c) did not substantially abridge defendant's First Amendment constitutional rights; thus, the ordinance had not been unconstitutionally applied. The real issue was whether defendant created an obstruction that violated the ordinance, and that could only be determined after trial of the general issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city zoned a portion of the city as institutional. Some years later the property owners acquired their property, a single family dwelling, and sought to convert it to a two-family dwelling. The city denied their request for a permit to convert the house. In their declaratory judgment action, the trial court held that they were precluded from challenging the ordinance because they were aware of it before they purchased the house. On appeal, the court held that a property owner could challenge the validity of a zoning ordinance, even an ordinance that had been in place prior to the purchase of the affected real estate. The court reviewed the evidence presented at the trial and held that the ordinance was arbitrary and capricious as applied to the property owners' property. There were other properties that did not conform to the institutional zoning, and there would be no adverse impact on the public health and safety if the house were converted to a two-family residence. The city did not offer any evidence of the reasonableness of the ordinance. Under Ohio R.

The accounts included the names of three nieces and one nephew of the childless decedent. The probate court found the accounts to be valid and the survivors to be entitled to their shares. Appellant beneficiaries under the decedent's will appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before her death, the decedent asked her niece to review her savings accounts. The niece made recommendations for increasing interest and simplifying her accounts. The decedent decided on joint and survivorship accounts, but depended on her niece to service the accounts. The court upheld the judgment of the probate court. The sums remaining on deposit at the decedent's death belonged to the surviving parties as against the estate unless there was clear and convincing evidence of a different intention at the time the accounts were created. Substantial evidence supported the probate court's finding that there was an intent to create such accounts. The court also noted the ample evidence to support the finding that the presumption of undue influence was rebutted. The decedent was in relatively good health and alert. Knowing what joint accounts were from working in a lawyer's office, she initiated the idea to change her type of accounts. Moreover, the accounts named the four people she knew best. Finally, the court held the probate court properly excluded evidence from which the beneficiaries sought to show that, because the niece was impoverished, she unduly influenced the decedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother and defendant father were divorced. The mother was awarded custody of the couple's child and the father was awarded visitation. The mother moved out of state and filed a motion to readjust the father's visitation rights. The Common Pleas Court of Crawford County (Ohio) ordered that the father be given visitation for the 1983-84 school year and then the case would be reviewed. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother objected to the propriety of the trial court's order and its power to make it as it concerned the extended visitation awarded the father. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.04 was not pertinent because the order did not modify its existing custody order but limited its order to a change in visitation rights. Thus the underlying problem concerned the concept of visitation and the extent to which visitation could be extended before it became, in fact, a change of custody, despite the nomenclature. The court held that the trial court had the power to make broad changes in visitation rights so long as the exercise of sound judicial discretion was not abused. Thus, the issue was whether there was an abuse of discretion. The trial court held that the child should have been placed with her father to give her an opportunity to capitalize and assimilate his values. Based on that reasoning, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court held that the action was not arbitrary because it was predicated upon a reasonable approach to broadening the parental influence of the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted and tried on one count of involuntary manslaughter for allegedly causing the death of his wife. The three-judge panel declared a mistrial. Defendant was brought to trial again, and the Common Pleas Court of Erie County (Ohio) denied his motion to dismiss. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the trial court committed prejudicial error by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of double jeopardy. Defendant contended that if the three trial judges at his first involuntary manslaughter trial were unable to agree on a verdict, the State's case must have been insufficient, and defendant should have been acquitted. The court rejected the argument regarding the insufficiency of the evidence. Defendant also challenged a statement made by the trial judges that their inability to agree was caused primarily by a failure of both parties to develop the evidence. Defendant argued that the trial judges improperly placed the burden on defendant to prove his innocence. The court noted that a court spoke through its journal entry and the journal entry in the case at bar did not contain any mention of the challenged statement. There was no abuse of discretion in declaring a mistrial. The court held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. The State could constitutionally retry defendant because a mistrial was declared due to the factfinders' inability to agree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings according to law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for legitimization, defendants, a mother and her child, challenged a decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, of Seneca County (Ohio), which adjudged plaintiff alleged father to be the natural father of the child, granted the father all rights and privileges of a natural father, and ordered a birth certificate to be issued. The trial court found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.18 to be unconstitutional to a certain extent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.18 to be unconstitutional in violation of the equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution insofar as it required the consent of the mother to the application and that the statute of limitations would run when the child reached 18 years of age. It was not disputed that the father was in fact the natural father of the child. In affirming the decision, the court found that the portion of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.18 unqualifiedly requiring the mother's consent to the application violated the equal protections provisions of the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. The remaining portions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.18 were constitutional and severable. The trial court's finding of best interest was neither supported nor refuted by the findings of fact and had to be given a presumption of regularity absent evidence to the contrary. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.u was a special proceeding and not a civil action as contemplated within Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.14. The trial court did not err in failing to apply the 10-year period of limitation in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.14.</SPAN></P>

The lower court found for the lender, and the borrowers sought review. The borrowers also sought review of the lower court's overruling their motion for relief from judgment under Ohio R. Civ.

The court found that the borrowers did not raise this issue in the lower court. The court also rejected the borrowers' claim that the note did not follow the statutory requirement for the format of a cognovit clause. The court found that the language and format of the cognovit clause was as the statute required. The court rejected the borrowers' argument that they were entitled to relief for judgment due to an oral agreement with the lender to convert the unsecured demand note into a secured installment note.

The suspensions were pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(K), and the appeals of defendants were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 4511.191(K) and attacked the process whereby the trial court suspended their driving privileges without holding hearings that met the procedural due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that due process did not require, at a pretrial license suspension hearing, a full adjudication of the merits of the case-in-chief. Due process would be satisfied by an inquiry limited to the determinations set out in &sect; 4511.191(K). The court found that &sect; 4511.191(K) was constitutional. But, the court found that the procedures followed by the trial court, which were essentially summary in nature, did not comport with the minimum procedural due process standards contemplated by &sect; 4511.191(K) in those instances where defendants sought the full evidentiary safeguards afforded by procedural due process. The court held that the trial court was required to afford those defendants a hearing with the burden of proof placed upon the State. In addition, the proof of &sect; 4511.191(K)(5) had to consist of evidence, but &sect; 4511.191(K)(5) was not so vague as to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the suspension orders in several cases and affirmed the orders in a smaller number of cases. The suspensions were reversed in those cases where defendants sought a hearing and were refused and in those cases where defendants had their driving privileges suspended pursuant to &sect; 4511.191(K)(5) with proof of evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved from New York to attend law school in Ohio, and after passing the Ohio bar exam he worked as a part-time lawyer and part-time bartender in Ohio.

The trial court convicted defendant of a violation of the Ordinances of the City of Upper Sandusky, Ohio &sect; 335.01. Defendant asserted that there was no violation of the ordinance because he possessed a valid New York license and he was a resident of that state. He asserted that his intention was to return to New York as soon as he found a job in New York. The court affirmed the conviction because it determined that residence for the purpose of determining the violation of the statute was established by bodily presence in a place and the intention to remain in that place and there was sufficient evidence from defendant's continued presence in Ohio after he passed the Ohio bar to establish that he was a resident of Ohio.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under &sect; 5731.19, the value of the decedent's gross estate in Ohio included the value of all real property located in Ohio, to the extent of the decedent's interest in such property on the date of his death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary claimed that the probate division committed prejudicial error by overruling her motion to have Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.08.1 declared unconstitutional, by refusing to continue the matter set for trial and to grant an order requiring discovery pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 30, in overruling her motion for limine and in allowing the scrivener, attorney to testify as to the competency of the testator, and in failing to sustain her motion as to interpretation as to paragraph 3 of the codicil to the will. The court affirmed the judgment. Nothing was shown in the record to rebut the presumption that the legislation was presumed to be constitutional. The granting or overruling of the beneficiary's motion for discovery was within the discretion of the probate division, and under the facts and circumstances it did not abuse its discretion. The attorney could testify concerning communications between himself and the testator, as there was a waiver of the attorney client privilege by express consent of the testator. The antemortem statutes were for one purpose only, and that was to determine the validity of the will and/or codicil, not to interpret the will.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the evidence merely addressed the victim's credibility. The court agreed with appellant's contention that the evidence of the victim's involvement with another person demonstrated both a possible motive for the rape charge and a possible origin of semen. The court stated that it reviewed the record and found the probative value of the evidence concerning the victim's romantic involvement exceeded the inflammatory and prejudicial effect the evidence might have had on the victim.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) when the beekeeper established that his property had been destroyed, the burden of proof was upon the Department to show that the hives were a public nuisance and their destruction necessary; (2) where the beekeeper had no expectation of privacy given state regulation of the bee industry, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 909.05 required a search warrant only for occupied dwellings, and the inspection was for a valid purpose, the statute was not unconstitutional as enacted or enforced; (3) the trial court had jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment; and (4) the Department should not have been allowed to elicit testimony as to the beekeeper's ostensive consent because it failed to raise consent as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

The action was previously before the Court of Common Pleas of Ohio, County of Trumbull (Ohio).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court for almost four full days listened to evidence and arguments of counsel making the following findings: the lion being a cat was capable of escaping, lions were by nature ferocious, and the effect of an escape by the lion was unknown. Further, the court noted that: an emergency ordinance preventing the keeping of such an animal was adopted, the lion had escaped on two occasions, and that the neighbors were concerned about the potential harm, if the lion escaped. The court concluded that if loose the lion could create damages and irreparable harm to the resident as well as others. The resident counterclaimed against the city to for its attempt to prosecute under a former ordinance, the adoption of the present legislation, and their bringing of the action to abate. The court held that the resident was creating a nuisance as defined in the ordinance of the city, he had failed to rebut the presumption of the validity of the legislation, and that the city had sustained its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence that the ownership, keeping and harboring of the lion was a public nuisance. The ordinance was valid and did not exceed legislative police power of the city.</SPAN></P>

The franchisee had filed an action against appellants alleging violation of federal and state franchise disclosure laws, 16 C.F.R. 436 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1334, in connection with a certain franchise agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A franchisor allegedly entered into a franchise agreement with a franchisee's predecessor agreeing to sell the franchisee a franchise to permit it to publish, distribute, and market advertising space in a certain monthly publication. The franchisee later filed an action against appellants alleging violations of federal and state franchise disclosure laws, 16 C.F.R. 436 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1334. On appeal from a summary judgment for the franchisee, the court held that: (1) appellants' allegation that the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment on the basis of a deposition that was not filed in accordance with Ohio R. Civ. P. 32(A) was waived by appellants' failure to object to the alleged error or to file a motion to strike, under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(F), or to suppress, under Ohio R. Civ. P. 32, in the trial court; (2) appellants' general denial to the franchisee's complaint was not sufficient to deny the granting of the summary judgment; and (3) the award of attorney's fees was erroneous because there was no evidence before the trial court of the amount of the attorneys' fees, of the reasonableness thereof, or of work reasonably performed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor's application for privileges to practice medicine was denied by the hospital during a period of probation and his provisional or temporary privileges were terminated. The doctor sued the hospital claiming that the hospital violated the Federal Civil Rights Act because it terminated his privileges due to his alienage. After a jury trial, the trial court ruled in favor of the doctor for damages. The hospital appealed. The court reversed and ruled that a review of the record supported a finding that the hospital's termination of the doctor's privileges was due to his professional incompetence and not his alienage. Moreover, the record revealed that the hospital had an exemplary record with respect to granting privileges to foreign-born or foreign-trained doctors. Thus, the court concluded upon a careful review of the entire record, that there was insufficient evidence to support the doctor's claim that the hospital terminated him due to his alienage, in violation of the Federal Civil Rights Act.</SPAN></P>

The State discovered a flaw in the indictment, moved for a nolle prosequi, and then reindicted defendant for the same offense. Another mental evaluation was performed. Several continuances occurred throughout the proceedings. The court held that: (1) the classification of the violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5589.04 as a third degree felony was not cruel, unusual, or disproportionate punishment; (2) the State had the right to permit a law enforcement officer to protect himself and to secure the detention of defendant who had been arrested by restraining him with handcuffs; (3) whether the trooper had probable cause to search defendant's car was irrelevant because the only evidence introduced against defendant was the spray can which was in plain view; and (4) because so many of the continuances in the trial were attributable to defendant, the trial was held within the time prescribed by Ohio Rev.

The board found that the petitions were sufficient. When the city council failed to set a date for a recall election, the voter filed a petition for a writ of mandamus compelling a recall election. Respondents filed motions for summary judgment and for costs and attorneys' fees. The court overruled respondents' motions and issued the writ. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 705.92 was applicable to the city's government and imposed upon the city council the duty to set a date for the recall. Section 705.92, the sole statutory provision explaining procedures and duties involved in a recall election, was construed as the &quot;law&quot; to which the city's charter referred. Thus, the recall provision of the city's charter was not void for vagueness. Respondents were not entitled to costs and attorneys' fees under Ohio R. Civ. P. 3(C)(2) because any diligent attorney could have made a mistake as to the proper venue. A writ of mandamus was proper because the city council breached its duty to act affirmatively and no other remedy at law would have corrected that breach.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellant ex-husband's action brought after a capias was issued for his failure to obey a child support order, the husband sought review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which granted summary judgment for governmental defendants, judges, a referee, a director of the Bureau of Support, and a clerk of court, and granted a motion to dismiss for nongovernmental defendants, his ex-wife, an attorney, and a law firm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the capias was dismissed at the wife's request and the husband was never arrested, he alleged abuse of process, malicious prosecution, negligence, and a violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court granted summary judgment for the governmental defendants based on judicial immunity, lack of standing, and failure to state a claim and the dismissal for the nongovernmental defendants based on collateral estoppel and lack of standing. The court held that, contrary to the husband's contention, the trial court clearly had jurisdiction to issue a capias in furtherance of its contempt power to compel compliance with its prior order pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2905.02, 2905.03, and thus was immune from liability with respect to the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. With respect to the common law tort claims, the governmental defendants enjoyed immunity. The husband lacked standing necessary to entitle him to declaratory relief because, once the capias was dismissed, his alleged injury was purely conjectural and not real and immediate. As against the nongovernmental defendants, the husband failed to state any claim for which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5711.16, the taxpayer's inventory of men's clothing was subject to a personal property tax. The Commissioner determined the value of the taxpayer's inventory on hand at the end of each of the taxpayer's accounting periods by subtracting the average writedown incurred in any one accounting period from the average book value of the inventory at the end of that accounting period. Under this method, a writedown was not allowed for the first three accounting periods that the &quot;average&quot; item was in the inventory. During the fourth accounting period, the writedown was allowed in the amount for which the item sold below book value. The Board agreed with the Commissioner's method and determination. On appeal, the taxpayer contended that the Board's method was unreasonable in that the values given to the inventories were in excess of the property's true value. In reversing the Board's decision, the court agreed with the taxpayer and held that the best method for determining the property's true value for tax purposes was to ascertain the amount the property sold for in an open market arms-length transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department received legal custody of the mother's four minor children because they were neglected. The mother asserted that at the hearing, she requested counsel because she was indigent but her request was denied. The department later petitioned for permanent physical custody of the children, and a hearing was held at which the mother was present with her counsel. The juvenile court awarded permanent custody to the department, and the children were subsequently adopted. The court held that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.353(C), the mother was entitled to have counsel appointed to assist her in the neglect, dependency, and temporary custody proceedings. The court found that the mother had not voluntarily waived this right. However, because the mother was represented by legal counsel at the parental rights termination and permanent custody proceedings, she was not deprived of due process of law under the United States or Ohio Constitutions. In addition, the mother's action was barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3107.16 because her action was filed more than one year after the final decrees of adoption were issued for the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's petition for post-conviction relief was denied, defendant appealed on the grounds that the prosecuting attorney's closing arguments went beyond the bounds of the argument, that the trial counsel of the State's choice failed to do his end of effective assistance of counseling for defendant, and that the court of common pleas erred where it dismissed the petition to vacate the judgment on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim without holding an evidentiary hearing in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21(E). On review, the court affirmed. The court held that 1) the prosecutor's statements were within the permissible range of debate and the alleged error was subject to the doctrine of res judicata; 2) defendant's effective assistance of counsel claims was also subject to res judicata; and 3) the trial court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing because defendant's allegations, which addressed counsel's incompetence, were general in nature, and such general allegations provided no basis for any inference of prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The consultants prepared a written recommendation and presented their report to the county commissioners in a public meeting and to the city council in a meeting of the whole council. The telephone company's action alleged that certain statements made by the consultants were false and defamatory and were made with actual malice. Affirming a judgment for the consultants, the court held that the doctrine of absolute privilege attached to the appointees of a city council and county commissioners when the appointees were appearing before the legislative body in a formal session called to consider a matter that was pending before the body. The court held that the doctrine of absolute privilege attached to the publisher of the matter even if the publication was defamatory and malicious in nature. A necessary principle in free government was to be able to have an unfettered give and take discussion on matters of public concern that were being decided by a legislative body.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution sought to have the judgment entering a nolle prosequi reversed, contending that the prosecution alone could establish pretrial diversion programs and that the trial court could not make referrals or enter a nolle prosequi without prosecutorial approval. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that it was to determine whether the diversion ordered was strictly a prosecutorial or a judicial decision. The court held that the timely objection to the referral, with good cause shown, should have been allowed by the trial court. Defendant should have been denied the opportunity to enter the program and escape trial. Defendant had been arrested on the same charge on two successive days, negating her alleged contriteness.

The prosecution sought revocation of the trial court's entry of a nolle prosequi on the basis that only the prosecuting attorney was permitted to recommend the dismissal of any charges brought against defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the powers of the prosecutor and the court had to be balanced in cooperation towards the legislative goals. The court found that the prosecution had consistently participated for years, voiced no objection to the original referral of defendant, failed to recognize defendant's rights, entered an unsupported objection near the end of the required period, and did not pursue its objection at the oral hearing before the trial judge. The court held that, in recognition of the prosecutor's acquiescence in defendant's participation, defendant's successful completion of the diversion program accepted by the trial court, entitled the defendant to a dismissal of the charges.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the police went to defendant's home pursuant to a warrant for his arrest, and that defendant's father answered the door and let them in. Several policemen testified that they saw defendant with blood on his arm removing a vial of capsules from his pocket. Defendant was advised of his rights and then questioned about possessing certain weapons. The officers were then led into the bedroom where they saw pill bottles. They were also in a position to see various drug paraphernalia on the kitchen table. They then went for and obtained a search warrant.

The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the licensees accepted the liquor permit and commenced operation of the permit premises, including the sale of intoxicating liquors, with the knowledge and understanding that the statutes of Ohio provided for the termination of the sale of intoxicating liquors at that location through the exercise of local option by means of a local-option election. Further, there was no denial of due process or equal protection, as the permit was terminated as a result of the area being voted dry at a local-option election and there was nothing in the statutory provisions or in the manner of conduct of the election that constituted a denial of due process or equal protection, especially since the permit was issued with the understanding that the right to use it at the specific location could be terminated by a local-option election conducted in accordance with law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from a trial court (Ohio), which convicted him of corruption of a minor, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2904.04, and sentenced him to two to three years to be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.04 was unconstitutional in that it denied equal protection and due process, that the prosecution failed to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was denied due process and equal protection due to ineffectiveness of counsel, and that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court was unable to say that the legislative classification created by &sect; 2907.04(B) was unreasonable. There was a rational basis for requiring corroborating evidence for the conduct defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.06, and declining to require corroboration under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.04 because there were valid distinctions between the conduct defined by the sections. As to defendant's ineffective assistance claim, the court found that the hearsay testimony of the victim's mother concerning a statement made to her by her daughter was improperly permitted to stand by the trial court. The court was unable to say that an indefinite prison term and the imposition of consecutive sentences were so greatly disproportionate to the offense as to shock the community's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03. Defendant argued that, upon the agreed statement of facts, the judgment of the trial court was manifestly against the weight of the evidence and contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove three others to an intended victim's residence for the purpose of stealing his money from his home, or from his person if the victim was present. The victim was there. One of defendant's co-conspirators struck the victim with a chain, and the victim retaliated by firing several shots. Defendant and his co-conspirators fled. Defendant was later charged with complicity to commit aggravated robbery. He pled not guilty. Thereafter, he voluntarily changed his plea of not guilty to no contest. Defendant and the State then agreed to submit the matter to the trial court upon defendant's plea of no contest and certain stipulations of fact. Defendant, through counsel, then argued to the trial court that he was not guilty. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court found that there was no deficiency in the case that would contradict the admission of the facts averred in the indictment, which were sufficient to establish the offense. The court reasoned that defendant aided in the execution of the offense by providing transportation and that it was a foreseeable consequence that the victim might well resist and that serious physical harm could result.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded for further proceedings. The prosecutor did not err in referring to the blood alcohol test during his opening statement because the State could not foresee future rulings on the evidence. However, once the trial court ruled that the test was inadmissible, the prosecutor's comments during closing argument that the test was kept out on a technicality were highly improper, inflammatory, and prejudicial. The comments in closing placed evidence before the jury that it was not permitted to consider. The court also found that evidence of defendant's prior conviction for reckless driving was improperly admitted because it was only admitted to show the jury that defendant acted in conformity with his prior actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators had three different apartment buildings of more than six units each. All of the apartment buildings had incinerators for the disposal of residential waste. In response to the operators applications for registration status of their incinerators, the EPA sent letters indicating that the applications were deficient due to a lack of complete information on emissions. Supplemental information was requested and the operators were warned that failure to comply would result in the return of their applications as though never filed. The operators filed notices of appeal from these letters to the Board, which found in favor of the EPA. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) where it was reasonable to assume that there was some relationship between the number of units feeding the incinerator and the amount of pollution emitted, the method of classification under Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3745-35-05 was based upon a rational determination that furthered a legitimate legislative objective; and (2) the Board correctly determined that the operators' applications did not provide sufficient information required for an approvable application for a permit to operate or a variance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainants previously sued the businessman for violation of township zoning regulations in the operation of a wholesale fireworks business and a consent judgment settled that litigation. The trial court found the businessman in contempt for violation of the consent judgment. The businessman appealed, asserting that he was denied due process of law, that Summit County, Oh., Ordinance No. 82-207 was unconstitutional as being in conflict with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.33, and that the ordinance was void for vagueness and overbreadth. The court disagreed and affirmed. First considering whether the contempt proceeding was criminal or civil, the court concluded, on the basis of the sanctions imposed, that the proceeding was criminal in nature and that the businessman was not deprived of any due process rights in the conduct of the proceeding. The court determined that the county ordinance did not conflict with the statute but, instead, was reasonably related to the statute's objectives. Finally, the court found that the ordinance was clear enough for men of ordinary intelligence to understand it and that the businessman chose to deliberately avoid compliance with it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's arrest, he was administered an intoxilyzer test to determine his blood alcohol content. Defendant argued that the State failed to show that it had complied with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, which required that the test be performed in accordance with methods approved by the state health department. The court rejected defendant's argument and affirmed. The calibration solution used in the test was identified by lot number, not by batch and bottle number as set out in the health department's regulations. The court found that the use of a batch and bottle number was a procedural requirement to ensure that the solution was not in use for more than three months. The age of the solution was ascertainable by the use of a lot number instead of a batch number and thus did not violate the regulations. The court also found that defendant failed to prove that he was prejudiced by the State's failure to exclude evidence of the calibration logs. Although defendant was not given the logs prior to trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the evidence to be admitted because defendant was permitted to view the logs at trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that the trial judge instructed the jury on the presumption that was contained in the ordinance and went on to state that it could be balanced by evidence of equal weight or overcome by evidence of greater weight.

The issue was whether the ordinance was in conflict with the general law of Ohio or was the state statute the general law and thus, municipal ordinances had to be in conformity. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11 provided that the possession of less than 100 grams of marijuana constituted a minor misdemeanor, which carried a maximum penalty of a $ 100.00 fine with no jail time. Niles, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 513.03 provided for a maximum fine of $ 1,000.00 and up to six months in jail.

The trial court granted defendant's motion for shock probation pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.061. The State filed a motion for reconsideration and argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2951.02(F)(3) prohibited shock probation. The trial court granted the State's motion. On review, the court found that the trial court erred when it denied defendant the opportunity to cross-examine the witness who testified for the State that there was stipling present on the victim. Instead, defendant was only allowed to call the witness on direct examination. The court found that undue limitation was imposed on defendant. The court also found that the trial court erred when it failed to consider defendant's theory of self-defense. The court found that defendant had been trapped in a room with the victim who had beaten her earlier in the evening. Furthermore, the evidence indicated that it was the victim and not defendant who caused the final confrontation and that defendant attempted to avoid the victim.

The court allowed the writs, finding that the county council had a clear legal duty to appropriate funds that were reasonable and necessary for the operation of relators as long as the requests were not an abuse of discretion. It found that neither the general division judges nor the juvenile division judges abused their discretion in fixing their respective operating budgets. Further, the probate division judges did not abuse their discretion in fixing its budget and the statutory limitation that restricted them to the amount of fees collected could not be applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sought review of a decision of the Celina Municipal Court (Ohio), which entered judgment in favor of appellee clients in their action for fraud and the recovery of money paid for &quot;estate planning services.&quot; The attorney alleged that the trial court erred in its denial of his request for a jury trial pursuant to Ohio Const., art. I, &sect; 5, Ohio R. Civ. P. 38, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.26.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clients' complaint alleged two causes of action: one, for fraud in the sale of a life insurance policy, and two, for the recovery of fees paid to the attorney. The attorney's answer and counter-claim demanded a jury trial. The trial court deemed the attorney's right to a jury trial waived when he failed to pay a $ 250 security deposit under local rules of the trial court. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the clients, found that the trial court's rule that mandated the $ 250 deposit for a jury trial was invalid, and remanded the case. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.26(C), the trial court's deposit rule exceeded the rulemaking authority of the trial court. Section 1901.26(C) limited the advance deposit that was required upon making a demand for a jury trial to $ 10. The trial court's rule, as applied against the attorney, constituted a prejudicial error to his rights to a jury trial. The trial was void ab initio and the court sustained the attorney's remaining assignments of error, which related to occurrences at trial. The attorney's demand for a jury trial was sufficient under Ohio R. Civ. P. 38(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the clients, determined that the trial was void ab initio, determined that the local rule regarding a security deposit for a jury trial was invalid, and remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration of the posting of an advanced deposit not in excess of $ 10, and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principals were employed by the board under one-year limited contracts.

Code &sect; 3319.02, that they were denied due process and equal protection under the United States and Ohio Constitutions, and that appellees acted in bad faith. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the principals' complaint failed to aver that a stigma that foreclosed their freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities had been created by appellees' conduct and, as such, no liberty interest was infringed; (2) the board exercised a governmental function in the execution of &sect; 3319.02 and acted in good faith in performing the evaluation responsibilities; (3) the final authority to renew the contracts rested within the discretion of the board; and (4) the board and the members were entitled to legislative immunity in enacting policies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole a pair of shoes from a department store, and as a result, was indicted for grand theft. Defendant's offense was enhanced from a petit theft into a grand theft by virtue of his previous theft offenses under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02(B). Defendant alleged that the statute was unconstitutional in that it subjected defendant to cruel and unusual punishment and deprived him of his liberty without due process of law. Defendant claimed that the statute unconstitutionally attempted to expose defendant to additional punishment due to his status as a prior felon or misdemeanant rather than punish defendant for the offense committed. The court, in affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, disagreed, and found that the statute did not improperly criminalize defendant's status as a prior offender, but rather, expressly required commission of a further criminal act before defendant was exposed to any additional punishment. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02(B) did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant's motion to dismiss the charges against him for unconstitutionality. Defendant was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a fine. On appeal, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11 provided that the possession of less than 100 grams of marijuana constituted a minor misdemeanor, which carried a maximum penalty of a fine with no jail time. The local ordinance at issue provided for an increased fine and up to six months in jail. Possession under the local ordinance was considered drug abuse and a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court found that it had declared the ordinance unconstitutional in another case, because the ordinance was in conflict with a general law of the State of Ohio. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court judgment, entered judgment for defendant, and discharged defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the levy of the assessment was not illegal within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2723.01. The land in question was properly encumbered by the obligation to pay the in rem assessment. The court also found that the prior owners were volunteers to the extent that they paid taxes for which they were not then personally liable. They could and should have protected themselves from the auditor's error by checking the ownership list provided by the city.

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by allowing the State to cross-examine him concerning a prior arrest, by failing to grant his motion for acquittal, by instructing the jury under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05, an unconstitutional statute, and by impaneling an alternate juror when one of the jurors failed to report. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court ruled that evidence of the arrest for carrying a gun was allowable under Ohio R. Evid. 404(B) as proof of preparation or plan, or under Ohio R. Evid. 406 as evidence of habit. Further, the jury could have believed evidence that defendant lay in wait for the victims and then shot at them; the requirement that defendant prove his affirmative defense of self defense under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05 was constitutionally proper; his legal representation was adequate; and he failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from the substitution of the alternate juror.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the worker asserted that service on the Board constituted notice to the Administrator, that the trial court erred in ruling that the Board's decision was an appealable order despite its erroneous mailing, in admitting an exhibit to demonstrate actual mailing, in failing to excuse timely service on the Administrator due to the post office's failure to deliver it promptly, and in failing to rule that &sect; 4141.28(O) was unconstitutional. In rejecting all of the worker's arguments and assignments of error, the court held that the absolute requirement in &sect; 4141.28(O) of service on the administrator was both constitutionally appropriate and directory, and failure of such service divested the trial court of jurisdiction. Further, the worker was not prejudiced by the erroneous mailing, the exhibit was an affidavit that properly attested to the Board's actual mailing, and the worker's challenge of the postal service requirement was meritless.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. ch. 3111.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a paternity action. At a hearing, the mother testified against the father. The father then pleaded not guilty and informed the trial court that he wanted an attorney, but was not able to afford one. The trial court informed him that he was not entitled to a court-appointed attorney because it was a civil case. He was also informed that if he did not file a $ 500 bond he would be committed to jail until the hearing. The father directed the trial court to continue the hearing and presented no evidence to support his denial of paternity. The trial court then found him to be the father of the child and ordered him to pay $ 25 per week in child support. On appeal, the court found that the father's due process rights were violated when the trial court demanded that he post bond or be sent to jail. Because the paternity action was quasi-criminal, the different treatment of the father based on his economic status was unconstitutional. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3111.08 was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection insofar as it allowed for the imprisonment of indigent reputed fathers solely because they were unable to provide a sufficient bond.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been employed at a reformatory as a staff psychologist.

Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71, for prosecutorial misconduct, and for failure to comply with discovery requests. On appeal, the court held that: (1) defendant had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 2907.03(A)(6) because upon indictment he was directly interested and adversely affected; (2) because the key terms &quot;authority&quot;, &quot;discipline&quot;, and &quot;supervise&quot; had common meaning, especially when viewed within a prison context, Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A service station was built on the subject property. The zoning code was later amended to prohibit such stations. Pursuant to Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 359.01 the station continued to operate as a non-conforming use until it closed. The owners petitioned for a variance to allow a used car lot on the property. The board denied the request, and it was not appealed. Six months later, an identical variance for a used car lot was granted to the owner in the area. Like the owners' property, that property had been a service station, a non-conforming use. A second request for a variance was denied. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the use was excluded from the more restrictive local retail business district, Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance 343.01(G)(4). To grant the variance would have effectively rezoned the property. The Board was, therefore, without authority to grant the owner's request and the variance granted to the other property owner the same purpose was in error. Thus, the judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that Ordinance No. 611.01(A)(1) was unconstitutionally vague, that the jury was improperly instructed, and that the conviction was not support by law and the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were an individual and the agency that he owned.

Defendants charged a fee for their services. Two undercover police officers purchased pari-mutuel tickets from defendants. The officers filed complaints against defendants. On appeal, the court held that Ordinance No. 611.02(A)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms of the ordinance were sufficiently explicit to inform those who were subject to it what conduct on their part rendered them liable to its penalties. The court ruled that defendants' actions were not conduct in connection with gambling expressly permitted by law because off-track better was not permitted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3769.08; therefore, the jury was not improperly instructed on gambling expressly permitted by law.

On review, the court found that based on the harm to be avoided by the ordinance and the measures taken by the city to accomplish its goals, the zoning ordinance, as applied to the landowner, was unconstitutional. The court noted that the city did not object to the storage of recreational vehicles but only to their storage outdoors. The court concluded that there was no rational basis for the disparate treatment accorded to the storage or parking of recreational vehicles and roofing trucks on the landowner's property. The court held that the zoning code arbitrarily and unreasonably restricted the use of such property. The court concluded that the prohibition on the outdoor storage of recreational vehicles did not bear any substantial relation to public health, safety, morals or general welfare, so it could not be upheld.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the disposition of the child was not contrary to ex post facto provisions. Given the limited consent regarding the use of the report and the amount of evidence presented by defendant at the suppression hearing, the court could not say that the ruling denying defendant's motion regarding admission of a report reflected the &quot;perversity of will, passion, or moral delinquency&quot; necessary to find an abuse of discretion.

First, the court held that the board had the power to transfer a narcotic from one schedule to another under Ohio Rev.

Next, the court held that because defendant failed to raise his argument regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 2925.11, he could not raise it for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club sought a determination of whether its activities constituted gambling or a nuisance. A month before the petition for declaratory judgment was filed, the club's president was charged in a municipal court with facilitating a gambling scheme at the club. The court reversed the dismissal of the club's petition, holding that the trial court erred in determining that no jurisdiction existed to render a declaratory judgment regarding whether certain conduct violated the penal laws. Although the trial court had jurisdiction, the granting of a declaratory judgment was in the trial court's discretion, The court remanded the action for the trial court to exercise its discretion, considering factors including whether rights may have been fully protected through other available remedies, whether the questions were determinable in a pending action between the same parties, and whether the judgment would not terminate the controversy. The court noted that the result of the criminal prosecution of the club's chief operating officer would resolve the question to be answered in the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The property owners submitted an application for a change in the zoning to light industrial. The Planning and Zoning Commission approved the request to re-zone, but the citizens of the city refused to approve the zoning change, pursuant to a referendum charter provision. The city stated that the existing residential use was reasonable. On appeal, the court held that the terrain, below flood level, access, and location dictated that the property should be zoned industrial not residential. The Planning and Zoning Commission recognized that the land was unsuitable for residential development. The zoning ordinances involved, restored by referendum, were subject to a constitutional test. The court found that the zoning ordinances were unreasonable and unnecessary to the public health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, Ohio, which convicted him on two counts of rape.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to have testimony that showed the complainant had a prior history of falsely accusing men of sex crimes admitted into evidence. Specifically, defendant contended that the complainant had falsely accused a witness of infecting her with Herpes. Upon review, the court found that the testimony was collateral to the prosecution of defendant for rape. Even if the testimony was true, it was not sufficiently probative of a history of false sex charges to outweigh the State's legitimate interests in excluding such testimony. The application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D) to exclude such testimony did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Defendant's voluntary statement to the detective concerning his lack of reticence to having sexual relations during a woman's menses was not opinion evidence or reputation evidence of his sexual activity within the meaning of &sect; 2907.02. Further, the testimony was irrelevant to the disputed issue of whether the complainant consented to sexual intercourse. Therefore, any error in its introduction at trial was harmless. Defendant's conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the city ordinances which required the registration of handguns, the possession of an identification card, and the penalties thereunder, violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Upon review, the court found defendant's argument without merit. Mere passive conduct was not involved. To violate the law, defendant had to acquire possession of a firearm. Second, the regulated conduct, possession of a firearm, was one which by its nature suggested the possibility of governmental regulation. Third, the gun registration ordinance was not designed solely for the convenience of law enforcement agencies. The purpose of the ordinance was to protect the citizens from violence arising from handguns and other firearms by keeping firearms out of the hands of unfit persons, that is, those ineligible to receive an identification card.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a no contest plea to aggravated drug trafficking after the trial court had denied his motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(5) violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it provided for cruel and unusual punishment and, further, that the maximum incarceration penalty violated the equal protection clause set forth in the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, defendant continued his argument that the sentencing portions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03 were unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's argument. The court first noted that the establishment of minimum sentences was properly within the scope of the legislature. The court pointed out that Ohio's mandatory incarceration provisions for drug trafficking was not materially different than the sentencing provisions of other states for a similar offense. The court concluded that the legislature had the power to enact a mandatory incarceration law for punishment of drug offenders, which became unconstitutional only when the punishment was grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that extreme emotional stress, as described in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.03, was not an element of the crime of voluntary manslaughter. However, the state admitted that mitigating circumstance in the indictment. The court stated that the state's duty was to prove that defendant &quot;knowingly&quot; caused the death of the victim. The allegation of the indictment reducing criminal culpability did not obscure the plain meaning of the notice of the conduct prohibited by the applicable statute. The admission by the state of &quot;extreme emotional stress&quot; inured to the benefit of defendant in his attempt to show that the death was the result of a negligent homicide. Defendant argued that a remand of the case for further proceedings would be violative of his protection against double jeopardy. However, the issue never came before the trial court. The court did not have original jurisdiction of such matters, and defendant's present contentions concerning double jeopardy were therefore without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor filed a writ of mandamus action against the city-auditor to continue the payment of vouchers and warrants for the Director of Public Safety in accordance with Ordinance No. 88-1981, enacted by the Oregon city council. The clerk argued that the mayor was not entitled to a writ of mandamus because the mayor named the clerk-auditor as respondent and that the mayor's complaint requested a writ ordering the clerk to pay wages pursuant to Ordinance No. 88-1981. The court found that a legislature could not abolish the office of Director of Public Safety directly, and it was forbidden to do so indirectly by removing the duties or emoluments of the position. The court reasoned that if an office was created by the state constitution, and specific powers were granted or duties imposed by the constitution, although additional power may have been granted by statute, the position could not be abolished by statute.

Code Ann. &sect; 5122.15(H). The patient contended that the disputed entry ordering his hospitalization was against the manifest weight of the evidence and denied him both due process and equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient sought review of the trial court's order committing him for treatment as a mentally ill person under &sect; 5122.15(H). The patient contended that he should not have been subject to commitment because he was not mentally ill, that his admission that he committed crimes should not have been considered credible based on his limited mental capacity, that his criminal acts were not of sufficient recent origin to permit his confinement, and that his due process rights were being violated due to his inability to stand trial, while continuing to be incarcerated. The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment based on its determination that (1) the patient's commitment was justifiable, based on his being a substantial risk of physical harm to others; (2) the patient's allegedly criminal behavior was sufficiently recent to meet the statutory definition of &quot;mental illness&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5122.01(A); and (3) the overwhelming weight of the evidence supported the trial court's findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for carrying a concealed weapon, a violation of &sect; 2923.12, trafficking in marijuana, a violation of &sect; 2925.03, and having a weapon while under disability, a violation of &sect; 2923.13. He appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed all but the trafficking conviction. The court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not show that his trial counsel substantially violated an essential duty. The court also upheld the denial of his motion to suppress because the evidence was seized during a pat-down search that followed a lawful arrest for a crime that was committed in the presence of a police officer; also, marijuana that was in plain view was properly seized. However, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to support the trafficking conviction because the evidence did not prove that he knowingly prepared the marijuana for shipment, shipped, transported or delivered marijuana, prepared the marijuana for distribution, or distributed the marijuana. The evidence supported a conviction for drug possession; the court modified the verdict to show a conviction for drug abuse, a violation of &sect;&sect; 2925.11(A), (C)(3).</SPAN></P>

He also carried a rifle in the car. He stopped at a gas station. After a dispute with the manager about the manager's failure to have pumped gas for a young lady that defendant knew, the manager was shot in both legs. Defendant was not injured. He fled the scene, threw the rifle from his vehicle, and did not report the incident. The evidence was conflicting as to who fired first. Defendant claimed self-defense. The trial court convicted defendant. The court affirmed. The trial court did not err in refusing to charge the jury on defense of family as a basis for self defense. There was no evidence that defendant had acted in any way except to defend himself. Defendant no longer had the burden of proving self-defense by preponderance of the evidence and due process did not require the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of self-defense. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(A) was not unconstitutional. Absence of self-defense was not an element of the crime of attempted murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the parties' divorce, the former wife moved to a different city with the couple's children. The wife alleged that her former husband persuaded her to move back with the children. The wife alleged that the husband made representations that they would get re-married if she moved back. Subsequently, the wife moved back to the area and the husband married another. The wife asserted that the husband's representations were falsely made with the intent of motivating her to return to the area to her detriment. The wife brought a contract and tort action against the husband. The trial court dismissed the action and on appeal the court affirmed. The court held that the husband was not liable under the Ohio &quot;heart balm&quot; statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.29, which abolished the civil liability for damages in an action based on a promise to marry. The wife's contract claim was also barred. The &quot;heart balm&quot; statute was a rational exercise of the state's plenary power over marriage, and there was no fundamental right to bring an amatory action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sought and obtained temporary total disability benefits, pursuant to a decision of the Industrial Commission. The employer appealed to the trial court. The employee died without filing the petition required by Ohio Rev.

The employer filed a motion seeking the trial court to direct the agency's administrator to file the petition. The trial court denied his motion and dismissed the appeal. The employer appealed, contending that the trial court erred by failing to afford the employer a right to appeal. The court found that the dismissal of the appeal involved an adjudication of claims without issue framing or evidence, because the statutory petition was never filed. The court held that the trial court should have adopted some practical procedure which would have resulted in the clear identification of the issues before taking further action.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the municipal court's judgment granting full faith and credit for the Alaska judgment and found that the judgment was void because the Alaska court lacked personal jurisdiction over the seller. Personal jurisdiction was lacking because the seller had no established business activity in Alaska, the sale transaction was a one-time casual sale to a willing buyer, and the seller was never present in Alaska and never transacted any business there. Moreover, the court found that the seller had not ever taken advantage of any of the benefits or services of Alaska, except for the roads or airspace used by the common carrier to make the camera delivery. By receiving a phone call and letter from the buyer, the seller did not avail himself of any particular benefit or law of Alaska, and the seller could not foresee that placing a one-time advertisement in a general trade magazine would require him to litigate in Alaska.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers, suspecting that liquor was being illegally sold on a Sunday, attempted to enter a private lodge.

On appeal of his conviction under &sect; 4301.66, defendant alleged that the trial court should have dismissed the action against him because the prosecuting attorney had failed to provide him with a bill of particulars and the complaint was vague, indefinite, and uncertain. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court ruled that a person charged with a misdemeanor in a municipal court was not entitled to a bill of particulars. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion for acquittal. Although the evidence was in dispute, the court concluded that, construed most strongly in favor of the State, the evidence was such that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions as to whether each material element of the crime had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that the complaints were fatally defective, the ordinance was vague and overbroad, and the trial court erred in not requiring the city to demonstrate that they knew or should have known that the dogs were vicious before they were charged with permitting a nuisance. Upon review, the court found that the complaints clearly stated violations of the ordinance, and thus, stated offenses under Ohio R. Crim. P. 3. The ordinance was not vague because it did not define the term &quot;bite,&quot; and neither biting dogs nor their owners have ever been accorded any constitutional protections under the First Amendment. The &quot;barking and howling&quot; section of the ordinance did not apply to defendants. The ordinance was constitutional as it applied to them. The court concluded that the ordinance plainly indicated a purpose to impose strict liability against persons who permit their animals to be nuisances. Thus, culpability was irrelevant. The city established a nuisance, and the verdict did not go against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A uniformed City police officer and a school security guard summoned two customers, suspected to be truants, outside of defendants' business, where they checked their student identification cards. Defendants demanded an explanation of the officers' motives in questioning their patrons. Several witnesses testified that defendant called the officers profane and racist names and taunted the officers. In response to the officers' request that defendant return to his business, that defendant challenged the officers to force him. The other defendant yelled profanities and screamed at the officers to go ahead and shoot him. On appeal, defendants claimed that the officers invaded the privacy of their business establishment in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. They further contend that they were unlawfully arrested for exercising their First Amendment rights. The court affirmed. The evidence was uncontroverted that the officers never entered the premises of defendants' business and, consequently, no search of the establishment was conducted. Defendants' speech qualified as &quot;fighting words&quot; and was not constitutionally protected by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which granted a motion to dismiss filed by appellees, the Industrial Commission and the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, on the ground that her claim for benefits was not timely filed. The employee contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84, the workers' compensation statute of limitations, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the two-year statute of limitations would have been tolled under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84(A)(2)(b) if she had been employed by a self-insured employer rather than a state fund employer. The court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing the employee's claim as time barred, finding that the statute of limitations' classification distinctions were relevant to notice of claims. The statute provided that the limitations period did not apply to a self-insured employer that paid compensation or benefits to the employee equal to or greater than that provided for in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4123.52, 4123.55-4123.62, 4123.64-4123.67. The court found that the distinction was appropriate because the self-insured employer was cognizant of the employee's claim when it paid the employee wages or medical expenses. However, such payment by the employee's state fund employer without notice to the Commission only made the employer and not the Commission cognizant of her claim. The absence of such notice precluded the agencies from investigating her claim and taking measures to protect their resources that a self-insured employer would take in a comparable situation.</SPAN></P>

They argued that the statute violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and U.S. Const. amend. VIII, due process, and equal protection of the law. The trial court dismissed the suit on the basis that the trial court could not be sued, the State was a necessary party, and there was no jurisdiction. The felons appealed. The court reversed because the trial court's performance required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.70 was administrative in nature. Hence, the trial court and judges were subject to becoming parties to a review of the statute's validity by declaratory judgment, as were other administrative agency officials, and judicial immunity did not apply. In addition, the case involved a judicial controversy wherein the felons had a legal interest concerning the constitutionality of &sect; 2743.70(B); therefore, a declaratory judgment action was a proper means of challenging the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county commissioner filed a declaratory action to declare invalid an administrative order that was adopted by the state public defender commission regarding the qualifications for assigned counsel and public defenders. The commissioner alleged that the order would result in irreparable damage and was unconstitutional. The trial court declared the rule invalid, finding that the commission had no authority to adopt the rule, and that the qualifications of an attorney to practice law was a judicial function. The state public defender appealed, claiming that the order was valid because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 120.03 authorized the commission to set minimum qualifications for its own defenders as well as those employed in the various county and joint commissions. The court concluded that the words &quot;minimum qualifications&quot; found in &sect; 120.03 applied to an indigent and not to his attorney. Although the commission had the authority to adopt standards for the state public defender, which was a right and duty set forth by &sect; 120.03(B)(4), it was not authorized to establish minimum qualifications, which was clearly a judicial function imposed on the courts by the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(E)(6), (F), did not provide sufficient statutory limits to guide the courts in preventing an arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of a penal statute. The court found the evidence showed defendant himself determined the &quot;unit dose&quot; when he cut off two &quot;hits&quot; and sold them from a piece of paper that was perforated to show delineated &quot;hits.&quot; Moreover, prior decisions had rejected defendant's argument that the statute was vague. The court also found that the evidence in the case clearly supported submitting the matter of defendant's guilt to the jury.

Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by refusing to allow him to introduce evidence of the victim's activities as a prostitute, which included her rape by another man, and by excluding evidence to rebut a witness's testimony and the victim's juvenile criminal record. On appeal, the court determined that, although there was substantial evidence that cast doubt about defendant's involvement in the rape, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's verdict. The court also held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D) the victim's prior sexual activity was not admissible, and that pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 609(D) the victim's juvenile criminal records were not admissible to impeach her. The court finally determined that pursuant to Ohio R. Crim.

At issue was whether or not the city should be charged for any of the benefits paid for a week during which he was totally unemployed by the city and the rubber company. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that the claimant was not unemployed with regard to the volunteer firefighters because he had not been fired or laid-off from that position. The court stated that the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.01 clearly defined &quot;totally unemployed&quot; and that the claimant met that definition for the week in question because he performed no services and received no remuneration. Nowhere in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4141.01(B)(3) were volunteer firemen listed as not included in what employment means.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found defendant guilty of three counts of passing bad checks in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.11. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in overruling her motion for judgment of acquittal and that the finding of guilty was contrary to the weight of the evidence and contrary to law. The court reversed the judgment against defendant. The court concluded that the transaction in question was outside the scope of &sect; 2913.11 because it was purely an extension of credit. The case involved solely a promise to pay a debt at a future date because defendant paid for merchandise using undated checks with the date to be filled in by the payee. The court found that the element of fraudulent purpose was absent because the payee knew that the funds were presently lacking on the day he was given the checks.</SPAN></P>

She pled not guilty and was tried before a jury, who convicted her of the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. A motion under Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 was not renewed at the close of all the evidence. Since defendant failed to renew her motion, she waived her right to a review of its denial on appeal. The court found that on the strength of eyewitness testimony alone there was sufficient evidence adduced whereby the court properly submitted the charge of murder to the jury. The court did not err in instructing the jury that defendant had the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, nor in instructing the jury that defendant had the burden of proving that she was not the aggressor as one of the elements of self-defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees claimed that the company was required to obtain a contract prior to the establishment or operation of a cablevision service system in any portion of the unincorporated area of the township. They sought an order of declaration as to the application of Ohio Rev.

The company claimed that &sect; 505.91was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court held that neither party had served the Attorney General of the State of Ohio with notice that a statute's constitutionality was in issue as required by &sect; 2721.12. Since the Attorney General was not served, nor made a party, the trial court had no authority to render a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the statute.

The trial court granted defendant's subsequent motion to dismiss the charge against him for failing to make daily reports because it would have been impossible for defendant, who was domiciled outside the state, to make daily reports. The trial court noted that &sect; 1533.42 was for the State's administrative and statistical use. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against him for possessing nets with undersized mesh. The State appealed the trial court's judgment granting defendant's motion to dismiss the charges brought under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.42. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that there was no basis in law for the trial court's finding that defendant was not criminally liable under Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with theft of cable television service after a cable television converter was found at his house. The converter unit allowed cable television subscribers to receive expanded cable television programming from the cable company. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the mandatory presumption contained in &sect; 4933.42, of the intent to steal cable television service from the basic fact of actual possession of a device capable of receiving cable television service, was unconstitutional on its face in that it violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. The court reasoned that &sect; 4933.42 required the trier of fact to presume all the elements of the offense from the mere possession of the device. The court also found that while there was evidence that defendant possessed the device capable of perpetrating the theft of cable television service, there was no evidence that a theft actually occurred. The court reasoned that there was no evidence presented from which a jury could reasonably infer that defendant actually acquired the cable television service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a police officer while driving a propane tank truck due to complaints the police had received regarding trucks carrying hazardous loads. By obtaining defendant's log book and bills and observing the physical condition of the truck, the officer discovered that defendant's truck exceeded the permitted weight. Appealing his conviction, defendant contended that the officer acted arbitrarily in stopping his vehicle in violation of his constitutional rights. Defendant claimed that there were less intrusive methods of reaching the government's legitimate interests without restricting the individual's right to uninterrupted travel. The court found that the State validly exercised its police power in promulgating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4513(B) and 5503.02(A) permitting truck inspections. The court found that the right to travel was not violated by the provisions because an individual who found highway safety inspections unpalatable could travel by means of mass transportation common carriers. There was no constitutionally-protected right to drive a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mayor and a city, sought review of the judgment from a trial court in Mahoning County (Ohio), which declared that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.271 (1973) was constitutional and afforded permanent civil service status to appellees, a civil service commission and a community development agency. The mayor and the city alleged that &sect; 124.271 violated Ohio Const. art. 15, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An evasion of proper appointing procedures by appointing authorities afforded no protection to employees and defeated the purpose of civil service. Such an illegal act could cause the public and the employee to suffer. Apparently, the legislature was aware of this dangerous practice when it adopted &sect; 124.271. If suddenly all employees, who had been in the classified service for two or more years, not having been properly examined, were displaced because of a failure in the appointment process, there would be chaos. Section 124.271 did not evade the Ohio Constitution, but rather provided a sensible enforcement thereof. The court's interpretation did not and should not burden government with untested incompetents. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.34 provided those civil service employees were protected only during good behavior and efficient service, and afforded the procedure for the removal of incompetent employees. The contractual acknowledgement of an employee relationship, while litigation of the issue was pending, rose to the level of estoppel. The community development agency employees were not specifically included in the unclassified service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator contended in its motion that the employee's notice of appeal was not filed within the 30-day appeal period as required by Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the employee contended that the trial judge erred in ruling that &sect; 4141.28(O) was constitutional because the statute denied the employee due process of law due to the ambiguous and indefinite meaning of words &quot;filing&quot; and &quot;clerk.&quot; The court reasoned that not every ambiguously worded statute was, ipso facto, void for vagueness as unconstitutional. The court held that under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.42, words and phrases in a statute were to have been read in context, and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage. The court concluded that the usual definition of the word &quot;file&quot; was consistent with every usage of a form of this word in the same subsection and other subsections of Ohio Rev.

On the lienholder's appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the prejudgment attachment violated the due process clauses of the United States and the Ohio constitutions by not providing judicial supervision and that the bond given by the lienholder was inadequate and provided no surety as required by Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After several officers viewed a feature film and three previews that they believed were obscene, they obtained a warrant to search the theater for the films. They subsequently charged defendant, who had sold them the tickets, with pandering obscenity but declined to charge the projectionist. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, alleging that an exemption for projectionists under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.35(C) denied defendant equal protection of the law. The trial court agreed and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that although &sect; 2705.35(C) had previously been declared unconstitutional, it had no effect on the charges against defendant because all non-managerial employees, projectionists and cashiers alike, would be subject to prosecution under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32. The court also determined that the State had not engaged in selective or discriminatory prosecution because it had operated in good faith by presuming that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2705.35(C) was constitutional and prevented the State from charging the projectionist.</SPAN></P>

The trial court was incorrect in its holding for the reason that the statutorily required &quot;accurate description&quot; of the territory of the sewer district was exclusively contained in Exhibit A of the charter and that Exhibit included all of the municipalities which voluntarily joined the sewer district pursuant to Ohio Rev.

It was stipulated that the population of the 42 municipalities and partial municipalities was 563,511 and that the population of appellant city was 570,500.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the parties separated, they entered into an informal verbal agreement, which gave the father possession of both children. The father and his children moved to Ohio, and the mother moved to Illinois. The mother temporarily cared for the children. The older child was returned to the father, but the younger child remained with the mother for 10 months. The father surreptitiously removed the youngest child from Illinois. An Illinois court granted the mother custody of the youngest child. Her appeal of the Ohio trial court's dismissal was consolidated with her habeas corpus proceeding. Despite the fact that the child was not within Illinois during the custody proceedings, the court held that the jurisdictional requirement of both Ill. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 40, para. 2104(a)(1)(ii) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.22(A)(1) had been met, Illinois was a state in which the child's custody was determinable. Further, the father had sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois for purposes of in personam jurisdiction. Finally, the Illinois decree was entitled to full faith and credit because both the Ohio and Illinois Child Custody Acts were substantially in accordance with each other.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the decision of the trial court regarding the administrative appeal and remanding regarding the declaratory action, the court held that the trial court was not empowered to grant monetary damages or injunctive relief in the appeal from the commission. The court also noted that the trial court did not have the power to remove the person appointed to the general maintenance position. The court determined that trial court had jurisdiction to reverse the commission's decision. The court found that the administrative appeal was not an exclusive remedy for the employees.

The probate court gave the department of mental health permission to withhold psychotropic medication from the patient in order to evaluate his mental state, it allowed a newspaper access to the proceedings, and it held that the patient was a mentally ill person subject to hospitalization. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the public had a right to access to the criminal trial; (2) there was sufficient evidence that the patient was mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, and that he required additional hospitalization; and (3) the probate court's order to withhold medication for purposes of the evaluation was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his convictions for grand theft and possession of criminal tools. The court held that defendant was not entitled to an acquittal because reasonable minds could have found that each material element of the alleged crimes had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Two eyewitnesses substantially testified that defendant stuffed merchandise into a gym bag and walked past seven cash registers toward the store exit. Uncontradicted evidence established that defendant was convicted of another theft offense in 1974, which was sufficient proof to turn the instant theft offense into a grand theft offense. Moreover, under &sect; 2923.24, the gym bag could be deemed a criminal tool by evidence that defendant had the &quot;purpose to use it criminally,&quot; without the benefit of a statutory inference. The court also rejected defendant's assigned errors regarding (1) pretrial error; (2) errors committed at trial; (3) final charge instruction error; (4) improper prosecutorial argument; and (5) error in not directing a verdict for defendant pursuant to Ohio R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for aggravated murder, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01. At the end of the trial, finding insufficient probative evidence of prior calculation and design, the trial court withdrew that charge and instructed the jury on the lesser offense of murder as well as self-defense. Defendant's request for an instruction on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.03, was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the requisite provocation to use deadly force was not shown anywhere in the record. The provocation in the form of an altercation was initiated by defendant. Further, there was no showing of extreme emotional stress brought on by provocation. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05, which placed the burden of proving an affirmative defense on defendant, did not violate defendant's due process rights. The removal of the charge of aggravated murder and the substitution of murder was done in a neutral and non-prejudicial manner. There was nothing improper in the trial court leaving to the jury the consideration of the charge of murder, and it properly informed the jury what the proof requirements were.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of speeding, and he appealed. The court found that the Uniform Traffic Ticket issued to defendant sufficiently charged him with a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.21(A) and (D). Moreover, the face of the ticket was sufficient to give defendant notice of the nature of the offense charged and referred him to the statutory section involved. Only the specific applicable subsections of &sect; 4511.21 were omitted from the face of the ticket. The court held that such a specific designation was not necessary and that defendant had not shown that he was prejudicially misled by the omission. The court found no conflict between Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 45.21(A) and (D).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a nonjury trial in the Lakewood Municipal Court (Ohio) of an unlawful transaction in weapons, in violation of Lakewood, Ohio Codified Ordinances, &sect; 549.07. Defendant was charged with and convicted of carrying a &quot;cestus.&quot; Defendant appealed, arguing that the law was unconstitutionally vague and that his right to bear arms was violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was walking down the street when he was observed and stopped by a patrolman. The defendant told the officer that he was going to a food store. He was wearing a Levi vest without a shirt, Levi pants, gold arms braids, black boots and leather wrist bands with silver studs which measured approximately 3/8 of an inch long. The officer demanded that the bands be relinquished to him as unlawful weapons. Defendant responded that he was a magician and used the wristbands as part of his stage costume and that he had been practicing that day. He was charged under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 549.02 with unlawful transaction in weapons. Reversing, the court rejected defendant's constitutional claims. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it used an unusual word. However, the court held that the leather arm bands were not a &quot;cestus&quot; as described in the ordinance. A cestus was a hand covering loaded with metal or lead used by boxers in the manner of brass knuckles. There was no definition of a cestus as constituting a wrist band.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order from the Common Pleas Court (Ohio) that entered a jury conviction for aggravated robbery under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2911.01, kidnapping under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.01, and carrying a concealed weapon under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant dragged a victim between two houses, took some items from her purse, and ordered her to take all of her clothes off. He did not rape her, but he struck her before leaving. The jury convicted defendant of aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and carrying a concealed weapon, but they acquitted him of attempted rape. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the attempted rape charge was not an unconstitutionally broad prosecution of defendant. There was sufficient evidence on the record whereby the jury could have inferred that defendant had taken substantial steps in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the victim's rape. Thus, the charges did not lead to a compromised verdict. The court also concluded that the prosecutor's remarks did not constitute a denial of a fair trial and did not require a reversal of his conviction. Although the prosecutor did make a remark that was, at most, a momentary deviation from the proper prosecutorial role, that statement did not rise to the level of misconduct. When viewing the closing argument in its totality, the court concluded that there was no prejudicial error sufficient to deny defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.13(B) and 2923.15(A). After a bench trial in the Coshocton Municipal Court of Coshocton County (Ohio), she was acquitted of the former charge, but convicted of the latter. However, the court found her guilty of negligent assault, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.14. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant stemmed from her alleged shooting of an individual whose spouse defendant had argued with at a party. At her trial, defendant's confession to police was admitted into evidence, along with testimony that when defendant arrived at the party, she was carrying a can of beer and appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. On appeal, the court rejected the four alleged errors raised by defendant, ruling that: (1) the trial court's refusal to suppress defendant's confession was not erroneous both because, under the totality of the circumstances, there was sufficient evidence to find that it was made voluntarily, and even assuming a Miranda warning was not given defendant, because the charges against her were misdemeanors, she was not due one; (2) contrary to defendant's argument, the offense of negligent assault, a third-degree misdemeanor, was a lesser-included offense of assault, a first-degree misdemeanor; (3) because the time defendant spent in jail before her trial was for violation of probation in another case, the trial court was correct not to credit it toward her sentence; and (4) the weight and sufficiency of the evidence supported the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition for postconviction relief, petitioner contended that the criminal statute under which he was convicted, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1), was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in dismissing appellant's petition without granting him a hearing. The court explained that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2953.21(c), the trial court was not required to conduct a hearing because appellant's petition failed on its face. Furthermore, the court rejected appellant's request for the appointment of counsel because the petition was without merit. The court explained that the doctrine of res judicata applied such that constitutional issues could not be considered in appellant's postconviction proceedings under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21 et seq. where they had already been or could have been fully litigated by appellant when represented by counsel, either before his judgment of conviction or on direct appeal from that judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ward challenged the appointment of a guardian of her estate. The court upheld the appointment. The court found that many witnesses testified as to the ward's inability to continue to care for herself and for her estate. The court rejected the ward's assertions that the trial court erred in finding that the court had jurisdiction over her. The court found no merit in the ward's argument that the trial court erred in its use of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2111.37 to establish its jurisdiction over her. The ward became a resident of Texas the day before the application for guardianship was filed. However, the court concluded that &sect; 2111.37 allowed Ohio courts to determine competency of nonresidents. The ward also contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2111.01(D) was unconstitutional because the term &quot;advanced age&quot; was unconstitutionally vague because one did not know exactly what age was &quot;advanced.&quot; The court noted that the statute did not use the term alone, but used it in conjunction with additional criteria.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed from a judgment of the Cleveland Municipal Court (Ohio), which imposed a fine of $ 100, with $ 50 suspended, on defendant after he pleaded no contest to violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.58(B), selling, keeping, or possessing alcohol for sale without permit, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4399.09, keeping a place where liquor is sold in violation of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution argued that the trial court erred in holding that the mandatory fine enacted for keeping a place where intoxicating liquors were sold was unconstitutional. The court agreed, holding that the legislature did not violate the separation of powers doctrine when it established mandatory sentences for certain liquor law violations. The court noted that while a reviewing court should not decide a constitutional question if a decision could be reached without reference to the question, a trial court had even less authority to decide the constitutionality of a statute, especially when the issue was not raised by either party and the record was devoid of any legal basis for summarily declaring the statute unconstitutional. The court interpreted the statutory scheme as the legislative directive to punish a violation of &sect; 4399.09 strictly according to the terms of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4399.99(C). Because these terms plainly commanded a fine of &quot;not less than&quot; $ 100, the court reversed the trial court's suspension of $ 50 of the minimum penalty imposed upon defendant for his violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4399.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for imposition of the full minimum penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold a magazine titled &quot;Three Way Positions&quot; to an undercover police officer. As a result of the sale she was charged with the offense of pandering obscenity. Defendant's conviction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.35(C) did not deny her equal protection of the law because all non-managerial employees could be equally prosecuted for pandering obscenity. The testimony of the officer who purchased the magazine did not make him an expert witness, nor did the court believe he was offered as such. Evidence of sexually-explicit toys was relevant and admissible to show that defendant was well aware of what was being offered for sale in the store. The trial judge told the jury that before defendant could be convicted of the crime charged, the State was obligated to prove the material obscene by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He then delineated the acts prohibited by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2907.01(F), 2907.32. He concluded by instructing the jury that it must test the evidence under the Miller standards. This was the equivalent of saying that if the Miller standard was not established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, there would be no conviction.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict of not guilty as to the second count of felonious assault and guilty to the remaining count of having a weapon while under a disability.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an insurance company and related parties, sought review of a judgment from a Marion County trial court (Ohio), which dismissed the insurance company's complaint against appellee, contractor, based on the fact that the claim was barred by the special statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.131.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor entered into a contract with a company owner to construct a building. The project was completed, and 10 years later the building burned down. The insurance company paid the loss and became subrogated to any claims of the owner. Subsequently, the insurance company filed an action against the contractor, and the trial court determined that the action was time barred by &sect; 2305.131. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment and ruled that the statute clearly covered all actions for any injury to property arising out of the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property. Next, the court held that a failure to specifically raise the issue of unconstitutionality based on the concept of unequal protection constituted a waiver of that issue as a basis for appeal. The court determined that the insurance company was not denied any due process rights, based on an argument that it did not have a reasonable time to file its complaint, because the 10-year time limitation was not an unreasonable restriction. Although &sect; 2305.131 was enacted three years after the completion of the project, the court noted that seven years still remained before any lapse accrued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1965, the Board of Zoning Adjustment granted the prior owner of the corporation's property a special permit for the continued use of a commercial structure.

The corporation operated the bar/restaurant for over eight years, and made financial improvements in the property. The city filed an action seeking to permanently enjoin the corporation from operating the bar/restaurant. The trial court allowed a neighborhood association to intervene as a party plaintiff. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs. On appeal, the court held (1) the city was not estopped from enforcing zoning regulations because of a failure of the officers of the municipality to make timely objection to the violation of the zoning regulation, (2) the principle of estoppel did not apply against a state or its agencies in the exercise of a governmental function, such as the enforcement of zoning laws, and (3) the corporation was not entitled to a variance because the application of the zoning law did not result in unnecessary hardship.</SPAN></P>

The company appealed the judgment of the Akron Municipal Court (Ohio), which affirmed a referee's report in favor of the holder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company came into possession of the motor vehicles pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4513.61. The company had refused to release the vehicles to the holder without payment of towing and storage charges. By mutual agreement, the vehicles were sold to prevent further depreciation, with the proceeds being held in escrow. The company contended that the trial court erred in ruling that the lien of the holder was superior to the company's interest. In vacating the judgment, the court held that &sect; 4513.61 was a special statute with a later adoption than Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4505.13, under which the holder claimed priority, because it took effect in October 1971. Section 4505.13 was a general statute that took effect in 1938. Accordingly, &sect; 4513.61 prevailed because if a conflict between general and special provisions was irreconcilable, the special provision prevailed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision was the later adoption and the manifest intent was that the general provision prevail. The court concluded that the trial court should have ruled that the company was entitled to payment of any expenses or charges incurred in the removal of the vehicles.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 1531.02, as applied to him, was unconstitutional. That section made it a crime to violate an administrative regulation adopted by the Division of Wildlife. Ohio Adm. Code &sect; 1501:31-15-02(U) required that deer hunters wear &quot;hunter orange&quot; while hunting with guns. Violation of this rule was a violation of the statute. Defendant claimed violation of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was deer hunting with a gun on private property with the owner's permission. He was not wearing &quot;hunter orange.&quot; Defendant was a practicing member of a group of Amish who believed that their religion prohibited the wearing of bright colors. The court concluded that there was no question that defendant's refusal to wear &quot;hunter orange&quot; was based upon a sincerely held religious belief. Defendant argued that because he was not able to hunt deer and comply with both the regulation and his beliefs, his First Amendment rights were violated, even though the conduct was only required if he engaged in a voluntary act. The court pointed out that nothing in defendant's religion compelled him to hunt deer. Nor was it essential to the Amish way of life. Given the choice between hunting deer lawfully, or following his religion and not hunting deer, the court concluded that defendant would have chosen not to hunt deer. The court noted that defendant could have hunted deer in Ohio for only two weeks each year and he was limited to one deer annually. The court concluded that the restriction that caused him to forgo hunting was only an indirect and very incidental burden on his religion.</SPAN></P>

As such, the court held that it was a logical interpretation of the language to require that in addition to a criminal purpose, a person must have committed an overt act, or a circumstance must have been present, before the crime was complete. Accordingly, a person must have loitered in a defined place with the purpose of engaging in a prohibited drug-related activity, and the person's actions must have satisfied one of the circumstances enumerated in the ordinance or some other overt act or circumstance must have been present manifesting such purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to dismiss, defendant contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional in that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution with respect to due process, both procedurally and substantively; it violated the equal protection clause, it violated the right to travel, and it was vague. The issues raised by defendant was that pit bulls were not identifiable as a breed, that pit bulls were not vicious per se, that there was no rational basis to single them out as vicious, and that dogs had a right to travel. The court held that defendant's challenge to the identification of pit bull terriers had no merit. The court noted that a legislative body had a right to assign its own definition for certain words. The city ordinance adequately and sufficiently defined &quot;pit bull terrier&quot; so that persons of ordinary intelligence were given fair notice. There was in the record sufficient evidence identifying pit bull or pit bull terriers as potentially vicious dogs. The enactment was constitutional even though it might not affect unidentifiable pit bull dogs.

The expulsion arose as a result of the student's admitted possession of drug paraphernalia on school grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student's expulsion was based on his violation of the high school's policy, which provided that the possession of drug paraphernalia on school grounds resulted in a 10-day suspension from school and the recommendation for expulsion from school. There was no question that the student violated the policy and was subject to a 10-day suspension or expulsion. Consequently, the board's enforcement of the anti-drug paraphernalia policy did not constitute arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable action. There was no dispute that the student possessed a marijuana pipe. He admitted that he took the pipe into his possession after finding it in the school parking lot. Thus, the board's order was supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. The student asserted that the board's failure to consider mitigating evidence denied him due process and was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. To the contrary, the board's approach allowed an important policy to have effect and weight. To insist the policy should have been compromised would have rendered the policy ineffective, meaningless, and possibly unfair. The board's action was well within its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class consisting of former state employees, brought an action alleging that Am. Sub. H.B. 500, Gen. Assem. (Ohio 1983) (Act), which created preferential hiring and salary benefits at a newly-opened minimum security facility operated by defendant Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, violated their rights to equal protection under Ohio Const. art. 2, &sect; I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department opened minimum and medium security facilities on the site of a former residential center for the handicapped. In response, the legislature passed the Act, which gave preferential hiring rights at the minimum security facility to displaced residential center employees and to Department employees whose job functions had been transferred to the new facility; the Act did not encompass the medium security facility. The class, who were hired at the medium security facility, alleged that the Act violated their right to equal protection. Upon consideration, the court dismissed the complaint. Noting that the class's employment status did not implicate a fundamental right that would have required strict scrutiny equal protection analysis, the court found that a rational basis existed for the Act's limitation of preferential employment opportunities. Beyond the obvious economic and logistic factors that clearly implicated the legislature's public policy prerogatives, the court found that the legislature had acted reasonably in determining that former residential center employees would have likely been more attuned to the minimum security facility's rehabilitative goals.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2743.56(C) based on the statute of limitations with respect to the minor child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim died on July 14 and a complaint was filed on July 15. The child was five months old at the time of the victim's death. The trial court appointed the GAL with respect to a custody action between the child's father and maternal grandmother, and the GAL filed an application for restitution over a year later under the Crime Victims Reparations Fund. The commissioner denied the application based on the statute of limitations. The court reversed the judgment and held that &sect; 2743.56(C) was unconstitutional as applied to infants under the age of 18 years because it required that the application had to have been made within one year from the complaint. However, under Ohio R. Civ. P. 17(B), a minor had no standing to sue before reaching the age of majority. Further, the tolling of the statute of limitations during incompetency was not interrupted by the appointment of the GAL so as to reconstitute a new limitations period applicable to a competent person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision denying the GAL's application for restitution on behalf of the child. The claim was remanded to the single commissioner and referred back to the attorney general for a complete investigation and a new finding of fact and recommendation. The GAL was afforded an opportunity to respond to the new finding of fact and recommendation. Costs were assumed by the reparation fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the Commission as a mutuel clerk at a race track and had been assigned to process wagers for a horse race in which one of the horses was trained by her brother. The horse's owner placed a bet on his horse at the employee's window. When the horse unexpectedly won the race, the owner sought to claim his winnings. When the employee received the ticket, she informed the owner that it had been cancelled prior to the race, even though the owner had done no such thing. The track paid the owner the full value of the ticket after it found that the ticket had been manually cancelled just before the race and that the only way to do that was for the employee to punch in the ticket number. On appeal from the Commission's suspension of the employee's license, the court held that: (1) where the administrative hearing officer found the Commission's version of the facts more credible than the employee's, the court could not substitute its judgment; and (2) because the employee was a license holder, she was chargeable with knowledge of the conditions of her license, which was properly revoked when she violated those conditions.</SPAN></P>

The probate court overruled defendants' motion to dismiss and motion for a protective order and ordered the cemetery to exhume the body. Affirming, the court held that the administrator was not required to have instituted a parentage action pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code ch. 3111 within the applicable statute of limitations because at the decedent's death there was no reason for the administrator to establish paternity because there was no benefit to him.

Defendant contended that Brookville, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 94.08(A) and essentially identical Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.62 were passed to prohibit possession of an open container by people who purchased the beer or intoxicating liquor at a location that was not normally meant for the consumption of alcohol. The prosecution argued that the beer or intoxicating liquor was not lawfully purchased &quot;for consumption on the premises&quot; because defendant was consuming it off premises. Finding defendant not guilty, the court held that Brookville, Ohio, Ordinances &sect; 94.08(A)(and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.62) did not prohibit someone who purchased beer or intoxicating liquor in a permitted establishment from having an open container in a public place.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a known prostitute at the time she was arrested and charged with violating the ordinance and the court denied her motion to dismiss the charges. The ordinance involved provided certain circumstances that a court could consider in an effort to determine the purpose of defendant at the time of an arrest for its violation, such as the fact that defendant was a known prostitute. The court determined that the ordinance did not violate defendant's right to free speech because it did not prohibit her right to express herself except when it was for the purpose of prostitution. The court rejected defendant's allegations that the ordinance was overbroad and vague and found that the statute was constitutional as it required an illegal purpose be present in addition to mere loitering. The court stated that the requirement that an overt act be present was sufficient to give defendant notice as to the requirements of the statute and provide definite prohibited conduct. The court found no equal protection violation because defendant's status was not subject to sanction and was not an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Since the criminally injurious conduct occurred prior to March 18, 1983, an award for expenses related to the decedent's funeral, cremation, or burial was limited to $ 500 pursuant to former Ohio Rev.

The attorney general did not meet his burden of proof of showing that the commissioners' decision was unreasonable and unlawful.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant registrar of the bureau of motor vehicles suspended the license of plaintiff driver for a six-month period pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.08(A), which forbade the issuance of a driver's license to an alcoholic. Plaintiff moved the court to declare Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although his suspension had run, the driver argued that the matter was justiciable because he and others could again be subjected to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.08 sanctions. The court found that the controversy was likely to recur and could evade review; therefore, the issues presented were not moot. The driver claimed that the definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot; in Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4501:1-1-16(B) violated the due process clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions by conclusively presuming that a person convicted of drunk driving three times within a three-year period was an alcoholic. The court agreed, holding that the registrar could not suspend the driver's license without due process of law and that conclusive presumptions violated due process. The registrar's conclusive presumption of the driver's status as an &quot;alcoholic&quot; by virtue of his three drunk driving convictions violated his right to controvert by proof before a tribunal every material fact which bore on the matter; therefore, it established a conclusive presumption violative of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the driver's motion to declare the administrative code statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court began by holding Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(A), (H), which shortened the statute of limitations from two years to one retroactively, unconstitutional as applied to the case in which the worker had timely filed his action before the enactment of the statute. This section was separable from the rest of the statute. Applying Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.50, the court held that the unconstitutional provisions were separable from the remainder of the statute. There was no evidence of a deliberate intent, goal, or purpose to cause injury to the worker as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(G)(1). Assuming that a machine was improperly installed and maintained by the employer, the proximate cause of the worker's injury was not the machine itself or any act of the employer or its personnel. The proximate cause of the worker's injury was his own departure from accepted company policy and his own past practice of not seeking assistance, mechanical or human, in lifting a roll of product. The worker's momentary exercise of poor judgment could not be imputed to his employer.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the savings and loan company was entitled to the requested documents, concluding that &sect; 1155.16 did not create a statutory privilege, but merely imposed a secrecy requirement. The court held that ODGF's argument that the cover statement of confidentiality prohibits discovery was meritless. Neither &sect; 1155.16 nor any cover statement on any report created an evidentiary or testimonial privilege whereby ODGF could avoid Ohio R. Civ. P. 26(B)(1), which permits discovery of any relevant document or thing that is not privileged. The court also found that under Ohio R. Civ. P. 34, the requirement of possession, custody, or control was met as to any items ODGF held, regardless that the examination reports, audits, and correspondence may be subject to the Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was plaintiff homeowners' action alleging that defendant city failed to keep the sewer system free of obstruction and failed to properly maintain and inspect the sewer, resulting in flood damage to the homeowners' property. Further, the homeowners sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to declare that the city could not retroactively apply Shaker Heights, Ohio, Ordinance No. 76-66.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner's house was built in 1927. They purchased the home in 1977 and committed themselves to correct any violations pointed out to them. Not until flooding problems came to the attention of the homeowners and the city in 1981 did the city try to require costly correction. The city attempted to enforce compliance with Shaker Heights, Ohio, Ordinance No. 76-66, to compel the homeowners to alter their 50 year-old storm system so that it drained into the city's storm drains rather than into the city's sewers. The homeowners brought the instant action seeking a declaratory judgment to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance. The court found that the homeowners had the right to rely on the fact that plumbing permits were issued in 1927 for their home. Furthermore, it was reasonable for them to feel secure when no point-of-sale violations were noted in 1977. They would have suffered significant damage if they were charged for the repairs necessary to comply with the ordinance. Thus, the court ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the city was estopped from enforcing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was estopped from enforcing the ordinance against the homeowners and forcing them to pay to relocate their storm system to the city's storm drains.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2743.60(E), a provision of the Ohio Victims of Crime Act, was unconstitutional. The commissioner made his decision after reviewing appellee applicant's reparations application, which was denied by the Attorney General.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant filed for reparations following an assault in which he was injured. The Attorney General denied the applicant's award, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.60(E), because the applicant had been convicted of a felony within 10 years prior to the assault. The commissioner concluded that &sect; 2743.60(E) was unconstitutional, and the panel upheld the commissioner's decision. The Attorney General appealed, and the court reversed, holding that &sect; 2743.60(E) did not violate the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions and could not be considered a bill of attainder. The court found that the purpose of the Ohio Victims of Crime Act was to ensure that the class of persons receiving reimbursement was restricted to innocent, law-abiding victims and their dependents. The felony exclusion in &sect; 2743.60(E) pointed to the purpose of preventing convicted felons from receiving reimbursement, which was rational and legitimate. The court concluded that &sect; 2743.60(E) was not a punishment even though it disqualified a claimant because of his felony record because there was neither a constitutional right nor a common law right to a reparations award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the panel's order, which upheld the commissioner's decision finding the felony exclusion in the Ohio Victims of Crime Act to be unconstitutional, and thereby denied payment of the applicant's reparations claim.</SPAN></P>

The noxious weed ordinance provided that all areas were to be kept free from weeds or plant growth that was noxious or detrimental to the public health. The ordinance lacked a definition of the particular vegetation which was sought to be controlled or a mechanism by which the particular vegetation was designated to be noxious and therefore subjected to governmental control. Ordinances that required the removal or destruction of noxious weeds were to be strictly construed and all ambiguous expressions or doubtful points were to be resolved in favor of the landowner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.011 required a city commission serving a school district, where the territory of the school district was located in more than one city, to be located in the city in which the largest number of pupils in the school district reside. Based on the facts, the civil service commission serving the school district was located in a different city. The court held that that &sect; 124.011 was violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court reasoned that the civil service commission was making decisions concerning the employment, layoff, promotion, suspension, and termination of non-teaching employees of the school district, even thought it was situated in a city that contained less than 50 percent of the school district's student population. Because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.40(B) required that the civil commission could have only been situated in a township with a population of at least 10,000 persons, the court held that the civil service commission could not have been situated in the appropriate township. The appropriate township had a population of 6,796.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the state statute requiring that the civil service commission to be located in a certain township was unconstitutional as applied to the school district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City of Columbus challenged an order from appellee State Employment Relations Board (Ohio), which governed a collective bargaining agreement with the City's police officers. The Board filed a cross-petition pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4117.13(A) seeking enforcement of its order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was the dispute resolution procedure the City instituted for the police department. The court did not accept the City's home rule arguments and held that the binding arbitration provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4117 were a valid exercise of the legislative function under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34. The court opined that preventing police officers from striking as well as maintaining order were matters of statewide concern because police officers enforced the laws of the entire state, not just municipal ordinances. The court observed that the conciliator had authority to create wage agreements, the law had a specific stated purpose, there were sufficient standards for the arbitrator to follow, and there was appropriate judicial review. However, the court rejected the hearing officer's conclusion regarding the futility of the order for fact-finding because it was not supported by substantial evidence. The court concluded that the collective bargaining agreement did not create an alternative dispute settlement procedure, and it determined that the Board erred in mandating the retroactive date it chose because it was a matter for the conciliator rather than the Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the Board with instructions that the statutory impasse procedure must be complied with prior to the commencement of binding conciliation. The court further directed the Board that it was not to instruct the conciliator as to the effective date of awarded compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee held both the position of township trustee and county building inspection, and the county sought to have him removed as trustee. The trustee sought a declaration that his positions of township trustee and chief building inspector were compatible, thereby precluding the county from removing the trustee from his position. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.57 presented no bar to his serving in both the classified civil service position of chief building inspector for the county and the non-partisan elected office of township trustee because the two positions were not incompatible on any statutory basis. The court concluded that there was no conflict of interest because neither position was subordinate to or a check upon the other, and the possibility of a conflict was very remote. The court noted that although the trustee could exercise decision-making authority in both positions, the possibility of any conflict arising as a result of those decisions and the possibility that such conflicts would involve either budgetary controls or the primary functions of either position, was unlikely and remote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with endangering their child pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2919.22(A). Defendants did not obtain medical care for their child who later died. The State attacked the affirmative defense of &sect; 2919.22(A), a prayer exemption for a recognized religious body, as unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amends. I, V, and XIV. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and alleged that &sect; 2919.22(A) was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the second sentence of &sect; 2919.22(A), the prayer exception for a recognized religious body, hopelessly involved the State in the determination of questions which should not be the subject of governmental inquisition, questions such as what was a recognized religious body, and by whom was it recognized. The second sentence of &sect; 2919.22(A) was clearly violative of the Constitution of the United States and the court held that it had no force or effect within the jurisdiction. However, the holding was limited to prospective application only. The court also found that &sect; 2919.22(A) created one standard of behavior for parents of one religious belief and another standard for a different group of parents, and as such, violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court then addressed defendants' claims of overbreadth and vagueness. The court ruled that the statute was undefined, imprecise, and in many respects unascertainable. The statute failed to provide fair notice as to what contemplated conduct was forbidden, and failed to set reasonably clear guidelines for those charged with its administration.</SPAN></P>

The tenants terminated their leases after the landlord gave them notice that their apartment building was to be converted into condominiums.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the landlord notified the tenants that their building would be converted into condominiums, the tenants advised the landlord that they were terminating their leases pursuant to &sect; 1327.06(e)(1), which granted them the right to terminate in the event of a conversion. The landlord challenged the ordinance's validity in its action to collect lost rent, and the city joined the action to defend the ordinance. The court rendered a judgment for the tenants and found that the ordinance was valid, reasonable, and constitutional. Because the ordinance was enacted before the tenants executed their leases, it was deemed to form part of the lease agreements and it did not violate the Contracts Clause. In addition, the ordinance served a basic societal interest by regulating the sale and operation of increasingly prevalent condominiums. The ordinance was structured toward condominium conversion specifically, not to rental agreements in general, and the impairment of the leases was not substantial. The ordinance's notice requirements were generous, and the landlord was aware of the ordinance when it entered the leases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of driving under suspension and one count of driving without being licensed. Because these are charges requiring a court appearance pursuant to Ohio Traffic R. 13(B), defendant was required by law to provide the court with proof of financial responsibility. Defendant filed an action seeking to bar compliance with the statute requiring a showing of financial responsibility, arguing that it was unconstitutional. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101(B)(6) was unconstitutional in that under the statute, the court's order of impoundment under &sect; 4509(B)(1) was deemed an administrative act of the court and because the statute gave the Registrar of Motor Vehicles power to hear appeals from these court orders. However, despite the fact that this portion of the statute was unconstitutional the statute's legislative purpose could be performed without these portions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with failing to establish proof of his financial responsibility.

The court granted the motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The application for an award of reparations from the Victims of Crime Reparations Special Account was filed on behalf of the minor children of a criminally injured victim approximately 16 months after the occurrence of the injury. The panel of commissioners found that no one had informed the minors that there was a right of claim as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2743.71. On appeal, the Attorney General contended that the order of the panel was manifestly contrary to law. The court held that applications for awards of reparations arose by virtue of special legislation and involved a special statutory proceeding. The right to participate was controlled by compliance with special criteria and restrictions contained in the Act, one of which was that the application must be filed within one year as provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2743.56(C) and 2743.60(A). The fact that the minors had no natural or legal guardian prior to the expiration of the one-year period was a distinction without a difference as to the fact that there was no tolling basis of any kind for anyone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant was tested by an intoxilyzer and each result exceeded the limit set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3), and an identically-worded city ordinance. Defendants claimed that the legislation was vague and overbroad, and violated due process of law as guaranteed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The court found that the per se provisions were neither vague nor arbitrary. The per se standard neither encouraged nor allowed arbitrary enforcement. To the contrary, there was a very precise standard for the determination of guilt. As for overbreadth, defendants failed to explain how their First Amendment rights were infringed. Defendants complained that the legislation created a conclusive presumption of guilt if a breath-alcohol test exceeding the stated limit was introduced, thus depriving them of their presumption of innocence. The court found that the statute contained no presumptions, but only elements that the prosecution had to prove. Negating the presumption of innocence with proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of the offense charged was consistent with procedural due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(3). He moved to dismiss the charge on the grounds that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was vague and mandated an impermissible irrebuttable presumption, in violation of due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the charge against him, arguing that a person of ordinary intelligence could not determine the standards of guilt under &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) and its prohibition of having a 0.10 concentration or more of alcohol by weight in the breath while driving a vehicle was an unconstitutional and irrebuttable presumption of being under the influence of alcohol. In denying the motion and upholding the statute, the court ruled that &sect; 4511.19(A)(3) was not vague because it sufficiently defined the standards of conduct for a drinking driver to understand. Although a drinking driver might err in an estimation of his alcohol content and thereby &quot;innocently&quot; violate the law, lack of precision was not itself violative of due process, especially since there was no reason why a person of ordinary intelligence would have any difficulty in understanding that he should not drive if he has consumed alcohol. Also, the statute did not create an irrebuttable presumption because the prosecution was not relieved of its duty of proving that a driver had the requisite percentage of alcohol in his system.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified that it looked as though the complainant had stopped, or was in the process of stopping, to yield to defendant's rig. The court held that the prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant operated his vehicle in a manner that showed intentional action with knowledge that an injury to another, or to another's property, was probable. The court stated that something more than a mere error of judgment was required to justify a conviction for reckless operation. Here, defendant thought the oncoming vehicle had stopped.

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.13(A), for forfeiture of an automobile that was used in the commission of a felony drug abuse offense. The record showed that defendant was in the operator's seat of the vehicle when he made a drug transaction with undercover agents. Defendant was arrested at the scene and was subsequently charged and found guilty of a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A), a fourth degree felony. The court granted judgment for the State and concluded that the State had established that defendant was the owner, operator, or the person in charge of the automobile sought to be forfeited. Although the State failed to prove defendant was the owner under the Certificate of Title Act, the evidence revealed that defendant had received the vehicle in a trade two weeks prior to his arrest, and defendant was operating the vehicle at the time of his arrest. The court held that the forfeiture statute was constitutional because the forfeiture of vehicles used in the transportation of narcotics was a rational method deemed necessary by the legislature to restrain the commission of the drug offenses and to aid in their prevention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(K) had just gone into effect, and defendant's license was suspended prior to trial because his Breathalyzer results indicated that his blood alcohol was more than one percent. Defendant filed a motion to reconsider the suspension. The court found that the Fourteenth Amendment was applicable to all state deprivation of a personal interest if such interest was a protectable property or personal interest. The court determined that a person's interest in his driving privileges, even pending a hearing, was such a protectable interest. However, when determining whether due process had been met, the court held that it was required to examine the private interest that was affected against the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used. The court held that the statutory procedure in place to determine whether defendant's license should have been suspended satisfied due process requirements because it was not allowed to suspend the license prior to examining the statutory factors.
