Defendant appealed his conviction, alleging that the trial judge gave improper instructions on accomplice liability, that the prosecutor made inappropriate remarks during his closing argument, and that the trial judge improperly questioned defendant and impermissibly commented on the evidence. The court determined that in weighing the probative force of the evidence relating to defendant's intent against the probative force of the accountability instruction, the error in the jury instruction was harmless. The court also held that the judge was not in error in his interrogation of the witness because the judge's question had already been covered by defense counsel and it appeared that the judge was attempting to clarify the material issue of defendant's intent. The court concluded that even if the prosecutor's remarks constituted error, it did not require reversal because it did not involve a material factor in defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested after delivering nude performances at an adult bookstore. Defendants were charged with obscenity, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20(a)(2) (1989), and public indecency, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-9(a)(1), 11-9(a)(2) (1989). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the public indecency charges, and the state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued on appeal that the trial court erred in determining that the application of the public indecency statute to defendants' conduct was unconstitutional because there had been no evidence, proof, or agreement concerning the nature or content of the conduct performed in the nude, or that defendants' conduct was &quot;nude dancing&quot; implicating first amendment rights of expression. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to dismiss the indecency charges on the basis that the facts, as agreed to by the parties, provided the trial court with sufficient information to conclude that the public indecency statute was inapplicable. The performance was the kind of performance that the legislature excluded from the coverage of the public indecency statute. The facts before the court plainly alleged a &quot;commercial erotic display,&quot; and the public indecency statute was applicable to only those exposures which were shocking and disturbing to the immediate audience, and not those commercial erotic displays which were designed to sexually arouse or gratify the audience. The public indecency statute was simply inapplicable to defendants' conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the public indecency counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted defendant of one count of first degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. Defendant appealed the first degree murder conviction on the ground that the Illinois murder statute was unconstitutional, and that the first degree murder conviction should be reduced to second degree murder because she acted under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant instigated a large street fight that involved approximately 25 persons. After she was shot and hit during the fight, she shot and killed the person she began arguing with, and wounded two other persons. She contended that her injuries were sustained in &quot;mutual combat&quot; and were provocation serious enough to reduce an alleged act of first degree murder to one of second degree murder. In affirming the conviction, the court held that (1) the murder statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 et seq. was constitutional, and (2) defendant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the killing occurred under a sudden and intense passion that resulted from serious provocation by the victim. The court found that defendant did not undergo a sudden and intense passion that resulted from the victim's provocation. The victim did not provoke defendant because defendant testified that she was not angry with the victim, and that she did not even see the victim when she fired the gun. The court rejected the mutual combat argument by stating that defendant could not characterize the fight as &quot;mutual combat&quot; because she instigated it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for first degree murder and two counts of attempted murder was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court of Ogle County (Illinois), which convicted defendant for criminal sexual assault, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-13(a)(3), and aggravated criminal sexual assault, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14(b)(1). The trial judge granted defendant's motion for a new trial as to the criminal sexual assault but denied the motion as to the aggravated criminal sexual assault conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was denied a fair trial when the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a video-taped statement made by the complainant prior to trial. At trial, the prosecution had played for the jury a videotape of an interview wherein the child victim of the sexual assault detailed the facts surrounding the alleged sexual assault. On appeal, the court held that the use of videotaped statements as a corroborative complaint was not contemplated by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10. The court held that a plain reading of &sect; 115-10 revealed that the statute did not expressly or affirmatively provide for the introduction of prior videotaped statements of a complainant. On the other hand, the court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10.1 specifically provided that certain videotaped statements could be admissible as prior inconsistent statements. The court held that the use of the child victim's videotaped testimony at trial operated to deny defendant's right of confrontation. Accordingly, the court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff adopted son appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Du Page County(Illinois), which dismissed his complaint against defendants, trustees and guardian ad litem, seeking a declaration of his right to receive income as the &quot;lawful issue&quot; of his adoptive father under trusts created by his father's grandfather.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adopted son had filed a similar suit claiming to be entitled to his deceased father's share of the trust income as his father's &quot;lawful issue.&quot; This claim had been rejected at trial and on appeal. The son filed the present case asserting that a 1989 amendment to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1652 expressly provided that adopted children were to be treated the same as natural children and that this statute created substantive rights that should apply to his case from the date the statute took effect. The trial court rejected the son's claim. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court considered the effect of the amendment and found that it raised a presumption that an adopted child was to be treated as a natural child but that this presumption could be rebutted by showing a contrary intent of the testator by clear and convincing evidence. The court found that a presumption was a procedural rule that dictated the effect of the absence of evidence and shifted the burden of production. As a rule of procedure or evidence, the court held that the 1989 amendment did not create or confer any substantive rights and did not prevent the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, remanded, and held that the trial court should have permitted the patient to file a doctor's report and abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint with prejudice for failure to do so in a more timely manner.

Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 6-201.1 (1989) was unconstitutional because it diminished the rights that vested under another pension plan by requiring the paramedics to either tender their previously unwanted contributions and up to nine years of compounded interest or lose service credits for the years in which they served as paramedics and contribute to the other pension fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Livingston County (Illinois) granting defendant's motion to suppress evidence, to rescind suspension of his license, and to quash his arrest, which had led to a charge of violating Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501 (1989) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-502 (1989) for driving with a blood-alcohol level of over 0.10 and for unlawfully transporting alcohol in a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted defendant's motion to quash his arrest, which arrest had resulted in a charge of driving with a blood-alcohol level of over 0.10 and of unlawfully transporting alcohol in a motor vehicle in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501 (1989) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-502 (1989), as well as to suppress evidence and rescind the statutory summary suspension of his driver's license. The court reversed that grant on appeal and remanded the case. The court reasoned that the arresting officers' observation of defendant's confrontational and bizarre behavior as to his dispute with another motorist created a reasonable and articulable suspicion that justified an investigatory stop and that probable cause for defendant's warrantless arrest existed. The court also held that, because the stop was made pursuant to the police's caretaking or public safety function, the stop did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. The court further concluded that the stop was conducted reasonably and with a minimum of intrusion into defendant's privacy and mobility and that the grant of his motion was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the Department did not lack subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the complaint; (2) the complaint was not timely filed because the alleged civil rights violation occurred when the terminal contract was issued by the employer, and the employee filed her complaint more than 180 days after that date; (3) the 180-day filling period was jurisdictional and the failure to file within the prescribed time limit deprived the Department of jurisdiction, and to hold otherwise would create an anomaly because the charge-filing time period would be jurisdictional for some rights under the Act and not for others; and (4) the charge-filing limitations period was not unconstitutional and the Act provided the exclusive means of redress for civil rights violations.

The patient amended her pleadings to comply. The trial court, however, granted the doctors' motions and dismissed the patient's case. The patient appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and held that the trial court abused its discretion. The court ruled the patient should have been afforded every reasonable opportunity to establish her case. The court held amendments to the pleadings were to be liberally allowed in order to comply with &sect; 2-622. The court found the patient made a sufficient showing of good cause for her failure to file the &sect; 2-622 documents in a timely manner. The court ruled the physician's report contained minor deficiencies, but it was sufficiently clear and detailed to meet the requirements of &sect; 2-622, absent a showing by the doctors that they were prejudiced.

The court held that the trial court erred in precluding questions regarding a venireperson's attitude toward defendant's U.S. Const. amend. V privilege. However, such error was harmless because the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming. The friend testified that he sat in the back seat of the car with defendant as he shot the men, he saw defendant go through a victim's pockets, and defendant gave him bloody money. Another witness identified defendant in a line-up and at trial. A bullet was found at defendant's apartment that was consistent with the bullet fragments removed from the victims, and the blood stains on defendant's clothes matched one of the victims. The murders and robbery were closely related such that the property was taken from the &quot;person&quot; of the victim even though he was dead.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers alleged that the county clerk illegally extended a tax on the bonds for a prior year under an allegedly unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in &sect; 16 of the Act. The taxpayers claimed that the Act improperly delegated to the county clerk legislative discretion in determining whether or not to accept the filing of the levy ordinance. The trial court found that the decision was an exercise of ministerial or administrative discretion and found that the Act was constitutional. The appellate court affirmed, holding that &sect; 16 of the Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative discretion to the county clerk. The court concluded that the practical construction of &sect; 16 was that anything filed before the completion of the prior year's tax books was included in that tax year. Because the tax books had not been completed when the bond resolutions and ordinances were presented for filing, the levies were filed on the prior tax year. The process did not involve any exercise of discretion by the county clerk.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 9-1(a)(1), 8-4(a), and 12-11(a)(2) and sentenced him to 80 years' imprisonment for murder, 30 years for attempted murder to run consecutively with the murder sentence, and 30 years for home invasion to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a party, defendant beat and threatened to kill a woman who he believed stole money and shot another woman to death. Defendant was convicted of murder, attempted murder, and home invasion under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 9-1(a)(1), 8-4(a), and 12-11(a)(2) and received consecutive sentences for the murder and attempted murder convictions. The court affirmed the convictions and the sentences. Because the evidence that defendant intended to kill the woman was overwhelming, any error in the court's instructions on murder was harmless. The trial court did not err in allowing testimony from the state's witnesses that they were reluctant to cooperate with the police out of fear for their safety because the testimony did not give rise to the inference that defendant in any manner threatened them but explained why those witnesses did not initially provide information to the police. The trial court did not err in finding that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination during the selection of the jury. Consecutive sentences for the murder and attempted murder were mandated by the factors in mitigation and aggravation.</SPAN></P>

The shareholders filed a complaint against the corporation and its directors, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction and later permanently enjoined the implementation of the plan, concluding that it was void, invalid, and unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction. However, the court also found that the plan did not conflict with the right to cumulative voting guaranteed by the state constitution. Therefore, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion when it issued the permanent injunction. The judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the unauthorized possession of a hypodermic needle or syringe.

Defendant's test results were positive and the state moved for disclosure of the results. The trial court ordered the test results disclosed to all attorneys in the criminal division, two persons in the county jail, and to the police supervisor. Defendant appealed and argued that para. 1005-5-3(h) was unconstitutional and that the disclosure order was an abuse of the trial court's discretion. The court held that the test mandate of para. 1005-5-3(h) was constitutional and was limited to persons convicted of criminality connected with high-risk behavior for the transmission of a deadly disease. The court vacated that portion of the trial court's order that directed disclosure of the test results to the attorneys as there was no justification for the disclosure. The court affirmed that part of the order requiring disclosure of the test results to county jail personnel and the police supervisor, as it was reasonable that such disclosure was in the public interest.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the sentencing scheme that allowed attempt misdemeanors to be punished as severely as the offenses attempted while attempt felonies were not punished as severely as the offenses attempted was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, defendants challenged their conviction in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for first degree murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 and sentence of 35 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' conviction, finding that there was no obligation on the trial court to believe defendants' alibi testimony over positive identification of the accused. The court found that comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument were not grounds for reversal because the comments were directly related to witness testimony, and not related to a witness refusing to testify. Defendants were not deprived of the right to have the jury evaluate the identification evidence, finding that defendants were positively identified in open court. The court ruled that one defendant was not unfairly prejudiced by the rebuttal testimony by two witnesses, finding that the rebuttal testimony was proper when it reflected adversely upon the credibility of that testimony. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 9-1 and 9-2 did not violate due process by requiring defendant to prove a mitigating factor to reduce a first degree murder charge to second degree murder. One defendant was properly sentenced because the court found that the trial court had properly considered his voluntary manslaughter conviction as a juvenile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for his natural life under the Habitual Criminal Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. 1953, ch. 35, par. 33B-1. Defendant allegedly robbed a small grocery store, and was identified by two eyewitnesses, the storeowner and a clerk, as the perpetrator. Defendant was initially convicted in a bench trial, but was granted a new trial. At his second jury trial, defendant raised a challenge to the prosecutor's exercise of four peremptory challenges to remove four black jurors. The court found that defendant was entitled to present his objections regarding the prosecution's peremptory challenges, and therefore remanded for a Batson hearing. Defendant also presented an alibi witness for the first time during his second trial. Defendant alleged that the alibi witness was improperly impeached by the prosecution as to why he had not come forward to offer his testimony earlier. However, the court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed the balance of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the Illinois murder statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 et seq. (1987), was constitutional. As to defendant's argument that he should have been found guilty of second degree murder, the court concluded that a rational trier of fact could find that defendant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a reasonable person would have reacted with intense passion and attack the victim with a knife, stabbing her four times, after arguing over the proceeds of a lottery prize and an insurance refund. The court, however, found that defendant's convictions for armed violence and murder were predicated on a single physical act, and vacated the armed violence conviction. Finally, the trial court did not err in failing to appoint new counsel after defendant alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Even assuming that his counsel made an error in trial strategy, defendant failed to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first degree murder, but vacated the conviction for armed violence. The court remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing on the murder conviction alone.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to natural life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, attempted murder, aggravated battery, armed robbery, and residential burglary, and sentenced to natural life imprisonment. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the compulsion defense did not apply to felony murder charges because: (1) the case was not one where defendant was compelled to commit the armed robbery and had nothing to do with the murders; (2) the legislature specifically excluded offenses punishable with death from the compulsion defense; and (3) defendant could have received the death penalty. The court ruled that 50 graphic photographs depicting the victim's injuries were properly admitted as relevant to whether one or two persons participated in the crimes because the pictures depicted the amount of force used. The court determined that once the death penalty was not imposed, the trial judge was mandated by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(a)(1)(c) to impose natural life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court dismissed the conspiracy indictments against defendants on the ground that they were barred by Wharton's Rule, which provided that an agreement by two persons to commit a particular crime could not be prosecuted as a conspiracy when the crime was of such a nature as to necessarily require the participation of two persons for its commission. The court reversed and remanded with directions to reinstate the indictments. The rule had current vitality only as a judicial presumption, to be applied in the absence of legislative intent to the contrary. The conspiracy statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8-2, specifically provided for enhanced sentencing for the conspiracy charges of pimping, soliciting, pandering, and keeping a place of prostitution, and the comments to the statute clearly stated that Wharton's Rule had been annulled. The rule was also inapplicable based upon the third-party exception because the conspiracies alleged against defendants involved a greater number of persons than was required for commission of the substantive offenses.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 10-5(b)(3) (1989), violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment, finding that the statute was constitutional, but that it was unconstitutionally applied to the father. The court determined that the state's failure to grant the same measure of recognition of legal parentage at birth to an unwed father as that accorded an unwed mother was based merely upon the biological reality that motherhood was obviously more apparent and more easily established. The court noted that once an unwed father complied with the statutory procedure of legally establishing his biological relationship with the child, he could not be convicted under the statute. The court concluded that the application of the statute would have deprived the father of equal protection of the law because the father was not a neglectful father who had abandoned his child. The court explained that prior to the child's removal by his mother from the shared residence, the father had resided with the child from his birth and provided financial and emotional support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the employer between 1959 and 1971.

The commission reversed that decision on the ground that the employee's claim was time-barred. The trial court affirmed the commission's decision. The employee appealed from the trial court's judgment, which was affirmed. Section 1(f) of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 172.36(f) (1989), provided that a claim had to be brought within three years of the last exposure to silica dust. Section 6(c) of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 172.41(c) (1983), stated that a claim was barred unless it was brought within three years of the date of the disablement. The court stated that the purpose of those two provisions was to protect employers against claims that were too old to be adequately investigated and defended. Therefore, para. 172.36(f) acted as a statute of repose and disablement within the applicable time frame was a condition precedent to recovery. The court held that para. 172.36(f) was not subject to the discovery rule.</SPAN></P>

The court held that para. 1005-8-1(a)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague because the language contained therein was specific enough to give reasonable guidance to the trial court and avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.

Plaintiff alleged that as a result of a search of his cell he had been charged in a disciplinary report with possession of money, a violation of department of correction rules, and that the had appeared before the institutional adjustment committee to respond to the charges. At the hearing, the inmate admitted to having the money and the money was confiscated and forfeited. The court affirmed the trial court's granting of the prison officials' motion to dismiss because the inmate had no protectable interest in the property seized by the prison officials and its disposal did not work a deprivation of any constitutional right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A district filed an eminent domain action seeking to acquire land for use as an access trail.

The property owners were allowed to withdraw the cross-claim and to amend their motion to allege that the district was acquiring the property as a trail or linear park. The trial court then granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that the district failed to obtain town approval. The district appealed, claiming that it met its burden to establish that para. 6309 did not apply to the land because a &quot;linear park&quot; could only be a man-made creation and a &quot;trail&quot; was not an access trail. The court affirmed the trial court judgment, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the property owners to withdraw their cross-claim and the ordinary meaning of &quot;trail&quot; must be applied, therefore town approval was required.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court. The court held that the Wrongful Tree Cutting Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 961/2, para. 9401 et seq. (1987) was constitutional because it did not prescribe a rule of procedure that would infringe upon the judicial power in violation of the Illinois Constitution, art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Circuit Court of Richland County (Illinois) of battery in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 12 -- 3(a)(1) (1989). Defendant was sentenced to serve 364 days in the county jail. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because there was no direct evidence of injury to the victim. The court rejected defendant's argument, holding that there need not be direct evidence of injury to sustain a conviction of battery based upon bodily harm. The court said that evidence of contact between defendant and the victim, combined with the jury's common knowledge, was sufficient to establish that defendant's conduct caused bodily harm. The court also rejected defendant contention that the trial court erred in admitting evidence concerning other incidents of abuse by defendant toward the victim. The court held that the evidence was relevant to show defendant's intent and absence of an innocent frame of mind. Finally, the court rejected defendant's contention that the sentence imposed violated the constitutional assurances of proportionate penalties and due process. The court held that the statutory scheme set in place by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 75, para. 32 -- 3 (1989) was reasonably designed to remedy the increase in violent crime, especially abuse directed toward children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault and appealed their convictions. Defendant one alleged that he should receive a new trial because the state forced him to be tried by a jury, and defendant two alleged that the state did not that he was accountable for defendant one's actions. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that: 1) defendant one was denied his right to waive a jury trial, requiring a reversal of his conviction and a remand for a new trial; 2) because the record showed that defendant two aided defendant one in putting the victim in to the trunk and held her while defendant one performed the act charged, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant two had the requisite intent to be found guilty of aggravated criminal sexual assault; 3) the trial court did not err in admitting certain evidence and testimony because such was either connected to the crime or clearly established defendant two's guilt; and 4) the trial court did not err in limiting defense counsel's cross-examination of the victim because the questions did not relate to her possible biases, interests, or motives to testify.</SPAN></P>

During the incident, defendant sexually assaulted the mother, threw a six-month-old infant across the room into a wall, and shot and killed the father. The mother and 13-year-old son identified defendant in a photo array and a lineup. Defendant was found guilty of and sentenced for murder, armed robbery, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and home invasion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the lineup identification and in court identification were reliable because the witnesses had a good opportunity to view defendant, their degree of attention was good, their certainty was high, and the time elapsed between the commission of the crime and the identification of defendant was only two days. The court also noted that another witness strongly corroborated the identification testimony of the mother and son. The court further held that because the evidence established that defendant was the principal in the murder, the accountability instruction for murder was properly refused. Finally, the court held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in its sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded judgment to appellee, enforced the covenant, and ordered appellants to remove the billboards. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the federal civil rights action did not act as res judicata, under either the same evidence test or the transactional test. Appellee's action could have been sustained without reference to the zoning ordinance and, although both actions involved appellants' attempt to erect billboards in the industrial park, the actions stemmed from different conduct at different times.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in precluding any evidence of prior sexual activity by the victim, who was eight years old, under the rape-shield statute and that had been denied effective assistance of counsel for failing to advance that argument in a post-trial motion. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that defendant had waived the rape-shield-statute argument by failing to advance it and that his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed because he suffered no prejudice by counsel's failure to include it. The court also ruled that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that the rule in Enoch was unconstitutional and that the distinction between criminal and civil defendants in requiring criminal defendants to preserve issues by post-trial motion was not without rational basis given distinctly different interests involved. The court held that given the evidence, a rational trier of fact could easily have concluded that defendant's testimony was untruthful and that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that defendant's consecutive sentences were not excessive when compared to sentences for other similar offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A cable provider notified a mobile home park's owners of its intent to install cable television facilities at the mobile home park. The mobile home park owners denied access to the park. The cable provider brought suit seeking a permanent injunction against the mobile home park's owners, alleging that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-42-11.1 (1989) precluded owners and operators of residential properties from denying access. The trial court permanently enjoined the mobile home park owners from precluding the cable provider from installing cable television facilities. The mobile home park owners appealed, arguing that para. 11-42-11.1 violated U. S. Const. amends. V, XIV, because it allowed physical occupation of property prior to a hearing. On appeal, the court held that neither the United States nor Illinois Constitutions required a predeprivation hearing because the statute adequately protected the property owner's due process rights, that the statute adequately protected the owner's right to just compensation, and that the circuit court did not err in finding that the cable provider provided valid notice. The statute recognized the property owner's right to just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First defendant and second defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted them of home invasion and armed robbery, and sentenced them to 25 years imprisonment and life in prison as a habitual offender, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, first defendant argued, inter alia, that he was denied a fair trial due to numerous implications of prior criminal conduct from witnesses and second defendant's pro se questioning. Second defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in not granting defense counsel's request for the appointment of another attorney to represent him due to a conflict of interest. Upon review, the court found first defendant's arguments without merit and held that in second defendant's case, the trial court's failure to appoint separate counsel or to take adequate steps to ascertain whether the risk was too remote to warrant separate counsel was reversible error.Counsel raised the issue of a potential conflict of interest at least four times several months before trial. Although the trial court superficially inquired into his reasons, no hearing was held concerning any possible conflicts. Based on objections by both defendants, the trial court found that no actual conflict existed. That superficial inquiry was not adequate to determine whether there was a possible risk of a conflict. In addition, second defendant timely requested another attorney.</SPAN></P>

Defendant allegedly accidentally shot the ex-boyfriend three times during the struggle. Defendant also was shot and was treated at the hospital where he was arrested. Defendant subsequently was convicted of second degree murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-2 (1987). On appeal, defendant contended that the statute violated the state and federal constitutions because it relieved the state from proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt, it violated the separation of powers, and it violated due process and equal protection. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that: (1) it was constitutional to require defendant to prove the mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence to reduce his conviction; (2) there was nothing in the statute prohibiting the state from charging defendant with second degree murder initially; (3) the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had an actual but unreasonable belief in his right to use self-defense; and (4) the trial court's rejection of the accidental shooting defense was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the trial court erred in finding no arrest was made at 6 a.m. when defendant was taken from his apartment because under the circumstances, a reasonable person would have concluded that he was not free to leave because an officer followed him into the bedroom to dress and he sat between the officers on the way to the station to be questioned. The trial court did not commit error in denying defendant's second motion to quash the arrest and suppress evidence, finding that the police had probable cause to arrest him. The court found that defendant's statements were attenuated of the taint of an illegal arrest. It was not error to permit photographs of how the victims died to be admitted into evidence because the state was permitted to do so. It was not plain error to admit hearsay evidence that defendant had burned the apartment because the testimony was not objected to, nor was he denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction. The fetal homicide statute did not violate the equal protection clause as it neither affected a fundamental right nor discriminated against a suspect class and the imposition of criminal penalties bore a rational relation to the protection of the potentiality of life. Further, the court rejected defendant's argument that the phrase &quot;caused the death,&quot; absent statutory definitions of when life begins and death occurs, was constitutionally vague as the trier of fact was not required to decide whether the entity within the mother's womb was a person or human being, but only that it once had life which was snuffed out by the acts of the defendant. The court also found the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction as defendant knew his stepdaughter was pregnant, he had the requisite criminal intent to cause the death of her unborn child, and that the fetus was alive prior to his actions and thereafter expired.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied the city's application for an administrative inspection search warrant. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court refused to grant the city's request for an administrative inspection search warrant because the city failed to plead in its complaints that there were interior violations at the building.

The court found no reference to the procedures governing administrative inspection search warrants in the court rules or any statute. The court inferred that the legislature, by the inclusion of the express right to appeal under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 108A-10 and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604, 134 Ill. 2d R. 604, intended to exclude the right to appeal from a denial of an application for a search warrant.

The court affirmed the dismissal of the counts for unlawful arrest because the farmers were never arrested, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress because the pleadings failed to allege the elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court reversed the dismissal of the farmers' civil rights claims. The municipality and the official would be liable if the farmers prevailed. Allegations that property was unlawfully seized and that the farmers were deprived of property and the free and lawful use of public highways without notice were sufficient to state a cause of action under &sect; 1983 for violation of the farmers' rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth amendments and the due process clause of the Fourteenth amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company brought suit against the county seeking a declaratory judgment that the county's zoning ordinance as applied was unconstitutional. Prior to trial, the utility company and the county entered into an agreed settlement order which granted the utility company a special use permit for a wastewater treatment facility. The citizens group subsequently filed a petition to intervene and a motion to vacate the order. The citizens group argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order because it did not contain a finding of unconstitutionality. It also argued that the trial court unlawfully bypassed the legislative process by approving the order without a three-fourths vote of the county board approving the special use permit. The court held that state law did not require a three-fourths vote for a special use permit when written objections were filed.

The complaint alleged violations of a special use, including unauthorized use of the property for commercial vehicles, for repair and washing of automobiles, failure to landscape a certain strip, and extension of the parking lot. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that Chicago's status as a home rule unit did not deprive the bank of the statutory authority conferred by &sect; 11-13-15 of the Code. The court also held that the bank sufficiently complied with &sect; 11-13-15 by alleging that its property would be substantially affected by the violations, and explained that an owner need not prove any specific or unique damages in order to maintain a suit; it was the nature of the zoning violation itself that established the substantial effect sufficient for an action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations contended that the proposed amendments that governed the derivation and application of criterion under the narrative standard were invalid as an impermissible attempted delegation of Board responsibility to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Further, they argued that the new narrative standard violated due process proscriptions against vagueness and that the Board's rulemaking was invalid due to its failure to consider adequately the amended regulations' technical feasibility and economic reasonableness. The court affirmed the Board's decision and held that the Board merely granted the responsibility to derive and apply the Board's criteria to the agency according to detailed guidelines. Thus, the grant did not constitute an improper delegation of authority. Further, the corporations failed to prove that the regulations were void for vagueness merely due to a difference in expert calculations. The court deferred to the Board's expertise in technical and scientific methodology. Moreover, the Board specifically addressed the issues of technical feasibility and economic reasonableness, and those decisions were also to be accorded deference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to unauthorized possession of a hypodermic needle or syringe, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 22-50(1) (1989), and was sentenced. Thereafter, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3(h) (1989), the lower court ordered defendant to submit to HIV testing. The test results were positive, and the state moved for disclosure of the results. The court ordered defendant to report for treatment information from public health officials. It also ordered that defendant's test results be disclosed to certain state officials. The lower court found it necessary and in the public interest that law enforcement personnel be protected against physical harm in future contacts with defendant and that both law enforcement personnel and lawyers in the state's attorney's office be informed of facts sufficient to initiate or institute proper criminal charges in future contacts with defendant. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the requirement that she be tested for HIV, and that even if she was constitutionally tested for HIV, the lower court's disclosure order was an abuse of discretion. The court affirmed the lower court's orders.</SPAN></P>

Those officials could protect their health by using appropriate levels of caution in any contact with defendant. The court affirmed the lower court's orders against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The employer's court action was filed after the Commission refused to dismiss the charges. The court affirmed the dismissal of the employer's court action and the refusal to enter a preliminary injunction. The 300-day limitation period in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 68, para. 7A-102(G)(1) was not mandatory. Therefore, the charges filed on behalf of the claimants were not untimely.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted the evidence was not sufficient to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of vaginal and anal penetration by force and that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to two consecutive seven-year terms. The trial court stated &sect; 5 -- 8 -- 4(a) of the Corrections Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005 -- 8 -- 4(a) (1989) required the imposition of consecutive sentences. The trial court found that, because of the particular facts and circumstances of the case, the prolonged and brutal nature of the assault, and defendant's past conviction for battery, more than a minimum sentence was necessary. The court affirmed. The jury had sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both counts of criminal sexual assault. The victim explicitly testified she did not consent to either vaginal or anal intercourse and the jury had an opportunity to listen to extensive cross-examination of the victim as well as the other witnesses for the prosecution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois), which convicted defendant of first degree murder, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9 -- 1. Defendant argued that prosecutors failed to prove his use of deadly force was not justified, that the second degree murder statute was unconstitutional, that the court should reduce the offense to second degree murder, and that prosecutors engaged in improper cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of first degree murder despite his claim of self-defense, argued that the second degree murder statute unconstitutionally required defendant to prove rather than have prosecutors disprove the existence of a mitigating factor. The court held that the new homicide statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9 -- 1, still required prosecutors to prove all the elements of first degree murder, but permissibly required defendant to prove the mitigating circumstances of second degree, either sudden passion or unreasonable belief of self-defense. The court analogized it to the affirmative defenses of civil litigation. Therefore, second degree murder was a &quot;lesser mitigated&quot; offense; in other words, it was first degree murder but with mitigating circumstances that warranted a lesser punishment. Consequently, the court could not reduce the first degree murder conviction to second degree absent plain error because the jury had made a finding of fact that there were no mitigating circumstances. The court held that cross-examination that elicited opinion testimony as to another witness' credibility was a de minimis error not objected to at trial and not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant of first degree murder because the new homicide statute meant defendant was not entitled to second degree murder absent a showing by defendant of mitigating factors. In addition, this meant that the court was precluded from reducing the offense to second degree absent a showing that no reasonable jury could find that there were no mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found him guilty of attempted murder and aggravated kidnapping, and found him eligible for an extended-term sentence for exceptionally brutal and heinous behavior. He was sentenced to consecutive terms of 60 years and 15 years, respectively, for attempted murder and aggravated kidnapping. He appealed on various grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found that defendant took the victim off the streets at gunpoint, drove her about the city, threatened her, tied her up, blindfolded her, then shot her when she attempted to flee. The gunshot severed her spinal cord and rendered her a paraplegic. The circuit court denied defendant's pretrial motion for a court-ordered psychiatric examination of the victim and refused to declare unconstitutional &sect; 115-7.1 of the Criminal Code of 1963, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-7.1 (1985). Defendant contended on appeal that &sect; 115-7.1, which prohibited a court from ordering a sex victim to submit to a psychiatric or psychological examination, was unconstitutional; it violated the doctrines of separation of powers and of equal protection. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court and found that &sect; 115-7.1 did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers. The state legislature was empowered to prescribe new and to alter existing rules of evidence or to prescribe methods of proof. The court also found that &sect; 115-7.1 neither created a suspect classification nor infringed on any fundamental right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him, upon a jury verdict of armed violence under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A -- 2 (1987) and of attempted second degree murder under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8 -- 4(a), 9 -- 2 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An altercation in a car between the witness and defendant led to the shooting of a state trooper, which the witness testified was committed by defendant and which defendant claimed was committed by the witness. However, when the trooper ordered the men to cease, the witness handed the weapon to the trooper, and it was the witness who was driving when the trooper heard a driver shouting for help. On appeal of his conviction, defendant contended that his conviction for armed violence arose from the same act as the attempted second degree murder conviction and should be vacated and that the second degree murder conviction was void under Illinois law and unconstitutional. In vacating the second degree murder conviction, the court held that because it was impossible for a person to intend an unreasonable belief that he or she was entitled to use deadly force, defendant's conviction for second degree murder based, as it was on an imperfect self defense, could not stand. However, the court affirmed the armed violence conviction because the vacating of the second-degree murder conviction left only one conviction and thus, there was no incompatibility nor double conviction.</SPAN></P>

The record showed that the charges against defendant were brought because defendant beat and shot a resident of a hotel where defendant also lived. Defendant and the victim got into an argument and a fight and defendant contended that he shot at the victim in self-defense because the victim was swinging a shovel at him. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court ruled that the prosecutor's questions to defendant during cross-examination and his closing arguments violated defendant's right to remain silent as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. V. The court found that defendant's rights were violated by the prosecutor's repeated questions asking whether he had told the police that the victim had struck him and by later commenting that if defendant had been injured he would have told the police. The prosecutor improperly used defendant's silence at the time of his arrest to impeach defendant's explanation of why he shot at the victim. Also, the court held that defendant's failure to object at trial did not waive the issue.</SPAN></P>

He was acquitted of both counts and convicted instead of second degree murder pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-2(a)(2) (1987). On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that defendant was successful in proving the existence of a factor that allowed him to be convicted of second degree murder instead of first degree murder. Therefore, the court found that defendant was not prejudiced by having to shoulder the burden of proof on the issue; moreover, the court found that the issue became moot when defendant undertook such burden successfully.

Defendant was informed of the statements the State intended to introduce at trial and there was an adequate basis in the record upon which the circuit court could have determined that the victim's statements were reliable. The victim made repeated and consistent statements about defendant poking and rubbing her vagina and her mother's physical observations supported the finding of sexual abuse. The court held that the circuit court did not err in admitting defendant's statements to the police and that the State was not required to produce the corroborating testimony of a witness to the confession because defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the suppression hearing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that he was denied a fair trial and that his sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate to the offense charged. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for the aggravated battery and ruled that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold a fitness hearing prior to trial. Although a psychiatrists testified that defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic and unfit for sentencing, the record properly reflected that the circuit court's observations of defendant and the information made known to it supported a finding that defendant was able to understand the nature of the proceedings and that he could assist in his defense. Also, defendant's claimed error of unfair comments by the prosecution was without merit since defendant failed to object to any of the comments during trial and it did not appear that the comments had any prejudicial effect. The court remanded the case with orders to vacate the conviction for armed violence since the facts indicated defendant did not act with premeditation and may have acted after some provocation.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment in favor of the tavern owner and the finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court agreed with the city that the door and window regulation was a valid exercise of its police power to regulate licenses, and the ordinance was a licensing restriction and not a zoning provision; it regulated establishments based on the type of business they conduct, not based on their location. The court stated that the ordinance had no effect of access to light or fresh air, additionally, the ordinance's preamble stated that it was enacted to control noise and preventing disturbing noises was a legitimate governmental purpose. The court held that the ordinance was rationally related to the goal of preventing disturbing noise. Although keeping tavern doors and windows closed might not have been the only way, or the best way, or the least intrusive way of controlling noise from such establishments, it was not an unreasonable way.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois) granted defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to comply with the statute of limitations for medical malpractice cases, &sect; 13-212 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complication arose during the minor's birth, and defendants allegedly did not respond to those complications in a timely and proper manner. The minor alleged that due to defendants' negligence she was permanently and severely damaged. Fourteen years after her birth, the minor filed her medical malpractice lawsuit, which was later dismissed by the trial court for failure to comply with &sect; 13- 212. Section 13-212 set forth the statute of limitation period for medical malpractice claims. On appeal, the minor argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 110, para. 13-212(b) violated her due process rights. The court held that the legislature, when faced with the need to set some reasonable time limits on medical malpractice claims, was allowed to assume that minors' parents looked after the interests of the affected minors. Therefore, the court held that it was not violation of the minor's due process rights. The court also held that the &sect; 13-212(b) did not violate the minor's equal protection rights because a shortened statute of limitations was not unreasonable in light of what the legislature sought accomplish via &sect; 13-212(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that second degree murder statute was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of proving an element of murder to him; that it violated due process and equal protection by deterring those convicted of second degree murder from appealing their convictions; that he acted in self-defense when he shot the victim; that he was improperly convicted of two counts of second degree murder for only one crime; and that it was an abuse of discretion to give him a 10-year sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The statute did not violate due process or equal protection rights. The trial court did not err in its finding that the state negated self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the second degree murder conviction was proper. However, there could only be only one murder conviction and one sentence for one count of murder, as there was only one death. Therefore, the conviction on one count of second degree murder was vacated.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 10 -- 5(b)(10) (1989). In seeking review, defendant claimed that a jury instruction regarding the &quot;lawful purpose&quot; of defendant's actions had created a mandatory presumption, thereby shifting the burden of proof to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On two occasions, defendant allegedly attempted to lure two girls into a car with promises of free haircuts. Thereafter, defendant was charged with attempting to lure a minor into a car in violation of &sect; 10 -- 5(b)(10). During the trial, the trial court instructed the jury that the State was required to prove an &quot;unlawful purpose&quot; and that the attempted luring of a child under the age of 16 into a motor vehicle without consent established an &quot;unlawful purpose&quot; unless rebutted or contradicted. Following a conviction, defendant sought review, claiming the instruction had created a mandatory rather than a permissive inference, thereby shifting to defendant the burden of proof and persuasion. Upon review, the court initially held that the words &quot;other than a lawful purpose&quot; did not constitute an element of the child abduction offense but provided an affirmative defense under &sect; 10 -- 5(c)(4). Notwithstanding defendant's failure to present an affirmative defense, the court held the jury had been erroneously instructed because the jury had not been given a choice in applying or rejecting the presumption, thereby forcing defendant to present evidence rebutting the State's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and attempted residential burglary. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting the state's motion in limine to preclude defendant from introducing evidence of the decedent's marital status where the evidence had little probative value. The court held evidence concerning the decedent being an off-duty police officer was properly admitted because the evidence was relevant as to why the decedent possessed a gun and handcuffs. The court determined defendant's prior burglary convictions were admissible for purposes of impeachment where the nature of the offenses adversely affected defendant's veracity and the convictions were not remote in time. The court concluded the murder statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 (1987), did not violate due process by requiring defendant to prove mitigating circumstances to obtain a jury instruction for second-degree murder where the prosecution was required to prove each element of first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.

Defendant appealed his convictions, alleging that the state knowingly used perjured testimony at trial. The court found that mere conflicts in the testimony of a witness with prior statements made by him did not establish that the witness had given perjured testimony. The court held that defendant failed to establish by satisfactory evidence that the testimony in question was willfully and purposely falsely given. Defendant also contended that the trial court violated his right to due process when it convicted him of multiple counts of murder, home invasion, and armed violence. The court stated that where there was only one person murdered, only one conviction was allowed. The court also held that defendant's conviction for armed violence was error because it was predicated upon the murder conviction and, as such, based upon the same act as the underlying felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the state had exercised peremptory challenges to dismiss two African-American venirepersons, defendant, a black man, raised a Batson objection. Although the judge did not require the state to explain its peremptory challenges, the assistant state's attorney did offer some explanation. The trial court denied the defendant's motion. After the state had exercised its fifth peremptory challenge, defendant raised another Batson objection. Defense counsel argued that the state had exercised all five of its peremptory challenges to strike blacks from the jury. The court noted that there was no systematic exclusion because, at that point, there were two black jurors on the panel. The court denied defendant's motion for a Batson hearing. After conviction by the jury, defendant appealed. The court remanded the matter to the circuit court for a Batson hearing because it found that defendant established a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the state's use of its peremptory challenges. If the state was successful in its explanations then the conviction was to be affirmed; if not, then the conviction was to be vacated and a new trial ordered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother filed a paternity action against the father. On the day of trial, the father requested a jury. The trial court struck his request because the father had failed to pay the jury fee as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 25, para. 27.2(14)(b) (1987). The father appealed, and the court affirmed. The father did not have a constitutionally protected right to a jury trial in a paternity action. Determination of paternity was not recognized at common law; therefore, no constitutional right to trial by jury inhered in such an action. Further, a paternity suit was a civil action and not quasi-criminal in nature. Finally, required of the fee did not violate the father's equal protection rights because a free jury trial in the context of a paternity action neither implicated a fundamental right nor involved a statutory classification based on race, alienage, or national origin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three mobile home owners possessed homes which did not comply with federal regulations, and, thus, did not comply with ch. 42 which incorporated those regulations. One home owner's structure did comply with federal regulations, but it was only 12 feet wide, and St. Clair Cty., Ill., Rev.

The lower court held that ch. 42 was valid and constitutional, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court ruled that the three home owners whose structures did not comply with federal regulations did not have standing to challenge the validity or the constitutionality of ch. 42 because they all admitted that the federal standards were proper. However, the home owner whose structure did comply with federal regulations proved there was no rational basis for St. Clair Cty., Ill., Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the administrative proceedings, the dentist was found guilty and was sanctioned for violating the advertising provisions of the Illinois Dental Practice Act, Ill.

The department sought interlocutory review of the trial court's grant of the injunction and the dentist sought review of the trial court's subsequent decision on the merits in favor of the department. The court consolidated the appeals and held that the trial court had the authority to issue the temporary injunction, however, the question was moot because the trial court had rendered its decision on the merits in favor of the department. The court held that the department's regulation that prohibited the use of the terms that were descriptive and only potentially misleading were unconstitutional as a violation of the dentist's free speech rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Village denied property owners a building permit for construction of a single family residence on property they had recently purchased due to a certain zoning ordinance. Owners contended village official told them that the property was buildable; therefore, they instituted an action against village to compel issuance of a permit. The trial court ordered the review and approval within 30 days of owners building plans, which owners appealed prior to the status date. The court found each half was a separate lot of record, and the sale of the property to property owners did not violate the ordinance in question because the parcel of land was already divided into two lots prior to the sale. Thus, no illegal division occurred under the ordinance. Further, the court found that other sections of the 1974 ordinance did not render the property nonbuildable. The evidence established that plaintiffs as innocent parties had substantial expenditures and a change in position made in good faith upon the reasonable probability of a building permit being issued. They had a vested right under the 1974 ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the Attorney General and the Illinois Department of Transportation, sought review from orders of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed plaintiffs' complaint and denied leave to file an amended complaint. Plaintiffs charged defendant contracting businesses with fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that defendants wrongfully and fraudulently attempted to avoid compliance with the minority business enterprise (MBE) provisions contained in the contracts, as well as state and federal policy requiring the use of MBEs. Defendants performed work on several state construction projects. Plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in finding that the Attorney General lacked standing and in finding that the Consumer Fraud Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1987, ch. 121 1/2, par. 261 et seq. (CFA), was inapplicable. The court held that in light of the undeniable interest of the state and its people in the proper allocation of public funds and the apparent lack of any other adequate means of redress, the Attorney General was not precluded from asserting the fraud claims. Further, the trial court erred in holding that the CFA was inapplicable absent an allegation of injury to consumers. In addition, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed counts I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII for failure to state a cause of action. However, the trial court erred in finding that counts III, IV, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, and XVIII failed to state causes of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) after a jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 38, paras. 9 -- 1(a)(1), (a)(2) and the trial court sentenced him to a term of 50 years' imprisonment. The trial court then denied defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the state presented more than enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had committed the offense with which he was charged. Thus, even if counsel had performed differently, the court was not convinced to a reasonable degree of certainty that the jury would have found otherwise. Moreover, the court believed that, on the whole, defense counsel provided zealous and effective representation. The court found that at no time had counsel conceded defendant's guilt of the crime charged, first-degree murder. Rather, throughout the entire proceeding, including closing argument, counsel vigorously tested and challenged the state's evidence. Accordingly, the court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by trial counsel's representation, and defendant's argument that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial had to fail. Regarding comments made by the state, the court found that the jury was admonished that the statements of counsel were not evidence and therefore, that the state's remarks, both individually and cumulatively, did not deny defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, nearby manufacturers, residential owners, and residential lessees, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed their amended complaint. The amended complaint alleged the invalidity of a city rezoning ordinance. Grounds for dismissal were that at least some appellants lacked standing and that some or all had failed to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the validity of a city rezoning ordinance on the ground that the rezoning of a parcel holding former factory buildings from a M1-2 restricted manufacturing district to a C1-2 restricted commercial district and then to a commercial-residential planned development was unlawful. The circuit court dismissed their amended complaint generally on a holding that appellants had failed to state a claim of arbitrary and capricious rezoning that would have violated their substantive due process rights under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970). The court reversed the circuit court in this regard after taking into consideration of such factors as the existing uses and zoning of nearby properties and the extent to which the rezoning would impact the nearby properties. On balance, the court found that the rezoning did not conform to the existing uses or zoning of nearby property, and that would each suffer at least short-term losses, while the rezoned property increased in value. Further, because appellants extensively supported their allegations of special harm, they had standing to challenge the rezoning decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of appellants' claims that the rezoning violated the city's own rezoning criteria and that the rezoning procedure violated the city's procedural requirements. The court reversed the dismissal of appellant's claim that because of a variety of alleged injuries attributed to the rezoning, the rezoning was arbitrary and capricious in violation of appellants' substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee responded to a summons he received by mail by coming before the circuit court seeking a continuance so that he could obtain a lawyer. At the next hearing the lessee appeared before the circuit court and stated that he had obtained counsel, had filed a jury demand, and while mentioning that he had not been properly served with summons, asked for a further continuance. The lessee decided to stand by his claim of special appearance even after his motion to quash service was denied and judgment was entered against him in a bench trial. The court agreed that the totality of the lessee's actions resulted in a general appearance. While appearing pro se to obtain a continuance to obtain counsel was not a general submission to the circuit court's jurisdiction, the subsequent filing of a jury demand and appearance seeking a further continuance constituted a general appearance. But, the circuit court committed reversible error when it struck the lessee's jury demand. The demand was properly and timely filed and there was no basis for striking it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) convicting him of two felony counts of driving while under influence of alcohol in violation of Ill.

Defendant argued that his statutory right to a speedy trial was violated because certain periods of pre-trial delay were wrongly attributed to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of two felony counts of driving while under influence of alcohol (DUI) in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-501(d)(3). As a result of his convictions, defendant's court supervision in a prior, unrelated DUI case was revoked. On review, defendant argued that his statutory right to a speedy trial was violated because certain periods of pre-trial delay were wrongly attributed to defendant. The appeals court ruled that only one four-day period was incorrectly ascribed to defendant. The court ruled that defendant's filing of a petition under the Substance Abuse Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, par. 6322, and a motion for substitution of judges lead to a delay that was chargeable to him. The court stated it was irrelevant that the state later decided to nol-pros the charges since the mere filing of the motion and petition made it impossible to set the case for trial before resolving the motions. The court also ruled that a continuance requested by defendant to review a lately discovered videotape was chargeable to defendant, since the state was diligent in informing defendant of the videotape after its discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed defendant's convictions because he was tried within 157 days of the date that he demanded a trial in this matter. The court ruled that only four days were improperly excluded from the speedy trial computations and that the other periods of delay were chargeable to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant attacked the constitutionality of the second degree murder statute, found in &sect; 9-2 of the Criminal Code of 1961, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-2 (1987). Defendant first contended that the second degree murder statute violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. However, his argument that the statute relieved the prosecutor from proving beyond a reasonable doubt every element of first degree murder was rejected. Defendant next contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-2 violated the equal protection clause of either the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution or the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. of 1970, art. I, &sect; 2. Defendants convicted of second degree murder did not risk being put in jeopardy any more than defendants convicted of first degree murder. The court held that defendants convicted of second degree murder were not denied the equal protection of the law. Defendant's contention that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-2 (1987) violated the separation of powers clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. of 1970, art. II, &sect; 1, was rejected.</SPAN></P>

The Department found that the agreements were licenses and were not subject to real estate taxes under the Act, the lower court affirmed the Department's decision, and the court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 100-22 (1985) stated that Authority property was exempt from taxation unless the property was leased and that the agreements were licenses and not subject to taxation. The court ruled that because the agreements did not give the businesses control of the premises and only gave the businesses the right to use the property for a specific purpose, the agreements were licenses. Because &sect; 100-22 was clear, the court held that later enactments by the legislature were not useful in interpreting &sect; 100-22.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant foreign-educated nurses sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which denied the nurses' motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to appellee director of the state department of professional regulation (the director). The nurses contended that the lower court erred in finding that the director could require them to pass certain examinations prior to licensure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of foreign-educated nurses ordinarily would have had to take a preliminary examination before a national examination, but that requirement was suspended by injunction during litigation attacking its validity. The state legislature then passed the Illinois Nursing Act of 1987, Ill, Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 3501 et seq. Under that act, all foreign-educated applicants for nursing licenses were required to take the preliminary examination. The foreign-educated nurses brought an action against the director of the state department of professional regulation, alleging due process violations. In the lower court, both sides moved for summary judgment. The lower court granted the motion of the director, and the nurses appealed. On appeal, the court found that the state had a legitimate interest in regulating the nursing profession. Even though the nurses had passed a higher-level examination than the one sought to be imposed on them, the court found the requirement to be a reasonable exercise of the state's power. The statute was not retroactively applied, as the nurses claimed, because the examination requirement was always in effect, only suspended during the litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the cause with directions to enter an order concerning notification to all nurses affected by the judgment and setting deadlines for the nurses to take the necessary examination.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the partners interest was reflected in the deed of trust, trust deed, and assignment of rents. The court reasoned that the partners, as beneficiaries, had a right to redeem from the tax sale by disclosing their interest of record and should have been entitled to notice of the pending expiration of the period of redemption if their names were reasonably ascertainable.

The court held that the additional affidavits would not establish the untruthfulness of the affidavit presented, and the additional affidavits were not relevant to the hearing.

The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) made two interlocutory orders denying the alleged tortfeasors' motion to quash the deposition subpoenas of two witnesses. The alleged tortfeasors sought review of the orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged tortfeasors filed motions to quash the subpoenas pursuant to the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 801 et seq. (1989). The court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the alleged tortfeasors' appeal, which was taken as a right pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 810(b) and Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307. The court found there was an apparent ambiguity with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 810(b), as one provision stated such orders were to have been considered final for purposes of appeal, and the other stated that they were subject to interlocutory appeal. Nevertheless, the court found the orders denying the motion to quash were neither final for purposes for appeal nor were subject to interlocutory appeal. The court found a judgment or order was final if it terminated the litigation between the parties on the merits, which the order at issue did not. The court found that the order was interlocutory in nature, made as preliminary discovery orders in a pending suit, and were not appealable because they were reviewable on appeal from the final order.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing, the circuit court amended its order of heirship to include the adult daughters as lawful heirs. The widow appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The law did not mandate a paternity action before the circuit court could determine heirship. Under the Probate Act of 1975, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110 1/2, para. 2-2 (1989), the circuit court was permitted to determine heirship for the adult daughters through acknowledgment by the decedent during his lifetime. Moreover, the totality of the evidence submitted by the adult daughters provided clear and convincing proof that the decedent had acknowledged them as his daughters during his lifetime. Finally, one of the adult daughters presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that her mother's husband was not her father because the husband had no access to the mother at the time of conception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. He appealed. His arguments centered around the admission of statements made by the four-year-old victim to her mother and the investigating police officer. He contended that the trial court erred by admitting the statements under either the spontaneous declaration exception to the hearsay rule or the amended version of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-10. The court affirmed. The court found that it did not believe that a child's display of excitement, or lack thereof, was controlling in the determination of whether the statement should be deemed admissible as a spontaneous declaration. Rather, the court believed that the more relevant inquiry was whether the facts of the particular case demonstrated sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness and reliability. The court held that the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; approach should be employed to determine whether the statements appeared to be the product of reflection or fabrication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a fight with an acquaintance. During that altercation, another individual struck defendant with a stick. The following day, defendant saw the acquaintance in a car and started shooting. A passenger in the car died from a gunshot wound. At trial, defense counsel wanted an instruction on second degree murder other than Ill. Pattern Jury Instructions, Crim. No. 7.06A (2d ed. Supp. 1989). However, the trial court did not instruct on that crime after defendant stated that he did not want an instruction. The jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder. On appeal, the court rejected his argument that the second degree murder statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 9-2 (1989), was unconstitutional under the Federal and Illinois Constitutions and any ineffective assistance of counsel claim that arose out of the instructions. The court noted that defense counsel's failure to foresee that para. 9-2, which served as the basis for Ill. Pattern Jury Instructions, Crim. No. 7.06A (2d ed. Supp. 1989), would be upheld was not incompetence. Furthermore, there was little likelihood that the outcome would not have been different had that instruction been given.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of reckless homicide after he operated a car with a blood-alcohol content of greater than 0.10, at an unreasonable speed, and disregarded a stop sign, thereby causing the death of four people. Defendant maintained that he was not acting recklessly because he was trying to help an injured friend. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction and held that the testimony of two six-year old boys in defendant's car at the time of the accident was credible, that they were qualified as witnesses, and that their testimony, together with corroborating evidence of defendant's injuries to his face, was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was driving the car at the time of the collision. Further, the court found no conflict between Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 236, regarding the admission of writings, and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501 (1989), because &sect; 11-501 imposed requirements for the admissibility of written blood tests unrelated to a document's admissibility under the business record exception to the hearsay rule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed an action against the property owners to condemn four retail locations and other nonretail space in their building on the basis that the space was chronically vacant. The property owners filed a motion to dismiss and traverse, alleging that as a home-rule municipality, the city lacked the authority to institute an eminent domain action. The trial court denied the motion and the court reversed. The court held that the exercise of eminent domain power by the city, pursuant to an enabling ordinance found in Wheaton, Ill., City Code ch. 8, art. V, &sect;&sect; 8-98 to 8-105, as a home-rule municipality to eradicate blight and promote redevelopment was a valid exercise of home-rule power. The Commercial Renewal and Redevelopment Areas Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-74.2-1 et seq. (1987) did not limit or preempt the city's power and the city was not required to abide by uniform standards. The court held that the enabling ordinance was unconstitutional because the phrase referring to vacancies was vague and overly broad. The court found that requiring the presence of only one of the factors enumerated in the ordinance to justify condemnation was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed that his instant sentence should be vacated because he was previously convicted of deceptive practices based on transactions occurring within the same 90-day period. The court found that the intent of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 17 -- 1(B) (1987) was to prevent a prosecutor from arbitrarily or intentionally aggregating transactions as to increase defendant's culpability and penalty. The two prosecutors neither arbitrarily divided the charges nor arbitrarily divided the chore of prosecution. Further, in the instant action, the prosecutor's delay in bring charges was due to an administrative oversight. Moreover, equal protection was not violated because any classification created by ch. 38, para. 17--1(B) was reasonably designed to promote the public interest. Thus, defendant's instant conviction was proper. Finally, defendant was eligible for an extended-term sentence by virtue of his previous felony deceptive practices conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city alderman and an advertising competitor of appellee advertiser, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed the competitor and alderman's complaint for a declaratory judgment to declare that a settlement between appellee city and the advertiser was invalid. The trial court had found that the alderman and the competitor did not have standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city settled with the first advertiser. Under the agreement, the city varied its zoning ordinance, which required outdoor signs to be set back from expressways. In return, the first advertiser dismissed lawsuit against the city. The competitor and a city alderman sought a declaration that the agreement was invalid. They also sought to have an injunction issued to restrain the city from issuing permits to the first advertiser. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's dismissal of the complaint. The city alderman did not have standing by virtue of his position as alderman alone. He was only a member of the city's finance committee and city council, but he did not have authority to act on behalf of those bodies. As to the competitor, there was standing on equal protection grounds. However, the competitor could not prevail on those merits because there was no purpose to treat the competitor differently. Yet, the court found that the competitor had standing to challenge the action by appellee, the city's corporation counsel, because the competitor's interests in protecting its competitive interests were sufficiently personal and peculiar.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction on the ground that the second degree murder statute, Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendant with first degree murder. He claimed that he stabbed his victim in self-defense. Pursuant to para. 9-2, the state had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of first degree murder. However, defendant had the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence one of the mitigating factors to reduce the first degree murder to second degree murder. Defendant contended that the burden shifting procedure of para. 9-2 violated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the United States Constitution and the Illinois Constitution's separation of powers mandate, Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 (1970). The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that (1) para. 9-2 did not violate the due process clause of the United States Constitution because the state was required to prove all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) para. 9-2 did not violate equal protection principles because defendant was not a member of a suspect class, and the statutory scheme was rationally designed to meet a legitimate state purpose; and (3) para. 9-2 did not violate the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court reversed and held that the trial court committed reversible error by permitting the decedent's last treating physician, who was not a defendant in the action, to testify after his ex parte communication with defense counsel. The communication jeopardized the strong policy of preserving the confidential and fiduciary relationship between a physician and patient and was improper. The court implied prejudice to the administrator from the facts and circumstances of the improper ex parte communication. The decedent's last treating physician violated his ethical and fiduciary obligation owed to the decedent. The ex parte communication between the last treating physician and defense counsel was without decedent's consent and concerned her treatment. The court prohibited the last treating physician from testifying at retrial because his testimony was tainted by the improper ex parte communication. In addition, the court held that the trial court erred by dismissing the claims against the hospital because a medical report attached to the complaint sufficiently complied with the requirements of Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over defendant's denials, plaintiffs testified that he had indicated to them that if they would help him scratch off the lottery tickets they would be his partners and would share in any winnings. On appeal, defendant asserted that the circuit court lacked the jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies. The court held that the purported sections of the Lottery Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 1157.3, 1163, 1169 (1989) were inapplicable and the Adopted Rules of the Illinois Lottery were at odds with defendant's position that plaintiffs had applicable administrative remedies. The court held that plaintiffs' pleading amendments had not prejudiced defendant by presenting a new theory of recovery, but had more accurately plead their original assertions. The court rejected defendant's contention that that the circuit court inconsistently awarded on the contradictory theories of both gift and partnership, and held that the circuit court found both theories as grounds for the plaintiffs' award. The court that the record evidence supported the circuit court's findings of an informal partnership, and the intention for a joint venture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury found defendant guilty of narcotics racketeering, the prosecution filed a petition for forfeiture of certain real property and bank accounts of defendant pursuant to the Act. Following a hearing, the trial court entered a forfeiture order. Upon review of the forfeiture order, the court affirmed. The court held that the forfeiture order was properly entered against defendant where defendant was not entitled to a jury trial during the forfeiture proceeding because the proceeding was part of his sentencing rather than part of the trial. The court noted that forfeiture could only be ordered under the Act until after a conviction and that the conviction, not the forfeiture, was what determined felonious guilt. The court found the Act was not unconstitutional on the basis that it only required the prosecution to prove the forfeitability of his property by a mere preponderance of the evidence because forfeiture was simply a punishment of the crime. The court concluded evidence regarding defendant's financial activity after the dates charged in the indictment was properly admitted for the purpose of determining what property was maintained with racketeering derived funds.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the act was vague in regards to those charged with robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction holding that the act sufficiently apprised defendant that the carrying of the firearm during the commission of the robbery subjected him to trial as an adult. The court rejected defendant's claim that the statute was meant to only apply to those offenders who pointed a firearm during the robbery. The court also held that any error in the trial court's admission of a witness statement was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. Finally, the court held that defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was also without merit because he was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to object to the erroneously admitted witness statement.</SPAN></P>

The department notified the taxpayer that its original state return could not be located and requested a copy of the original return with supporting documents. The taxpayer failed to provide the department with the requested documents. The department conducted an audit of the taxpayer and found a tax liability. It issued a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. The taxpayer protested, but the department upheld the tax deficiency and the administrative law judge and trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The taxpayer was required to use the form prescribed for filing an original return. The taxpayer attempted to bypass the filing provisions and negate its state tax liability by the belated filing of an amended return after its loss for another year had been sustained. It knowingly tried to combine two separate tax actions in a single form. Because it did not file an original return and did not pay the taxes owed, the taxpayer could not use a loss carryback to reduce its liability.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to file a counteraffidavit, and the court granted the village's summary judgment motion. On appeal, defendant requested that the court declare the ordinance invalid and enjoin the village from enforcing it. He argued that the ordinance infringed on his property and liberty interests and that it was overbroad. Defendant seemed to argue that he had a right to continue, unimpeded by the village, an antique refinishing and machine remanufacturing business he had begun prior to the village's adoption of zoning regulations. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and fine, holding (1) that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the village's police power, and (2) that the ordinance did not unconstitutionally interfere with defendant's exercise of his profession and was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by a grand jury on a charge of child abduction. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment and asserted that the statute was vague, overly broad, and unenforceable because it created an improper presumption and shifted the burden of proof of lawful intent or innocence to defendant. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant later filed another motion to dismiss and alleged that the Code section improperly combined choate and inchoate offenses. Over defendant's objection the trial court gave the State's proffered instruction on prima facie evidence. The court held that the trial court denied defendant his due process rights because the jury instructions as worded undermined the jury's responsibility to find the ultimate facts of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence that the State presented. The court made the determination that defendant was proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt so that defendant's retrial did not present the risk of a double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

The doctor filed a motion to dismiss the patient's complaint on the ground that the patient failed to attach an affidavit or written report to her complaint as required by Ill. Rev.

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the circuit court abused its discretion in not allowing the patient to amend her pleadings. The court held that there was no indication of bad faith or an intent to frustrate justice by the patient and there was no discernable prejudice to the doctor if the court would have either allowed amendment or dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The court noted that the patient presented current Illinois case law supporting the lack of compliance with &sect; 2-622 and attempted to cure the defect in her pleadings within 10 days of becoming aware of the requirements. The court reasoned that under the circumstances, the patient should have been allowed to amend because medical malpractice cases were to be determined on the merits when at all possible.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 12-503 did not violate defendant's right against unreasonable searches and seizures because the police had a right to stop a vehicle for safety violations. Further, the statute did not violate her constitutional right to privacy because defendant clearly violated the Code, which was the proper basis for a Terry stop. The statute also was not an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. Section &sect; 12-503 had a legitimate purpose in protecting police officers as they approached stopped vehicles and allowed officers to easily identify and observe drivers. Additionally, any impact on interstate commerce was incidental and was not an excessive burden.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff psychiatrist appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). Plaintiff, whose medical license was suspended, filed an interlocutory appeal in which he challenged &sect; 41 of the Medical Practice Act of 1987, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, par. 4400-41 (1987), which prohibited the issuance of a stay of sanctions while judicial proceedings were pending. Plaintiff also appealed the affirmance of his license suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff psychiatrist had a sexual relationship with a woman who was his patient and his employee. Defendant, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation, found that plaintiff was guilty of unprofessional conduct likely to harm the public. Plaintiff's license was suspended for six months, followed by a two-year probationary period. The trial court refused to stay the decision pending judicial review and subsequently upheld defendant's decision. The court affirmed. Ill Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 4400-41 (1987), which prohibited a stay of defendant's decision, was not unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff and his patients. Doctors who were sanctioned presented a significant risk to the public, and the legislature could properly allocate the risk of error to the doctor as opposed to the public. The record supported the finding that plaintiff's conduct was unprofessional and likely to harm the public. Plaintiff's patient was emotionally unstable and unable to handle her work situation when she first consulted with plaintiff; plaintiff acted in his own interest, not in the interest of his patient, when he entered into a sexual relationship with her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decision by defendant, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation, that plaintiff psychiatrist was guilty of unprofessional conduct by virtue of his sexual relationship with a patient who was also his employee was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The statutory prohibition against a stay of sanctions while judicial proceedings were pending was constitutional as applied to plaintiff and his patients.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions for murder, rape, and aggravated kidnapping. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court as modified.

The court held that the trial court did not err when it determined that the mental incapacities of a state witness could be given due weight by the jury hearing her testimony. The court ruled that defendant had no right to participate in a preliminary examination of the witness in an effort to discredit her competency. The court held that the prosecutor's comments were not improper, that the testimony of various family members of the victim was simply incidental to the admission of proper evidence and not presented in a manner calculated to mislead the jury, and that defendant was not denied effective representation of counsel. The court found that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in support of his Batson challenge, and that defendant was properly sentenced under Ill. Rev.

The trial court granted the insurance company's motion to dismiss the wife's claim and the wife appealed. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 5(a) barred the wife's cause of action for loss of consortium because the language of the statute clearly barred her claim. The court stated that while the wife's loss of consortium claim may have been an independent claim for damages, it arose out of the husband employee's injury. The court disagreed with the wife that she was not a person &quot;wholly or partially dependent&quot; upon her husband, as appeared in the language of the statute, and found that a spouse, whether or not dependent, received benefits directly or indirectly under the act. Finally, the court stated that &sect; 5(a), as previously construed by an Illinois court, prohibited recovery for loss of consortium claims against an employer.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 43, par. 135 (the Dramshop Act) did not provide a common law action of negligence for loss of support. The minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contended on appeal that the Dramshop Act unconstitutionally denied her an available remedy by excluding any relief for loss of support and that a common law cause of action should have been recognized under the circumstances of a tavern selling large quantities of alcohol to an intoxicated individual after requesting him to leave the premises because of his intoxication. The court held that the Dramshop Act provided the exclusive remedy in Illinois against tavern owners and operators for injuries caused by an intoxicated person or in consequence of intoxication, there being no common law liability for the negligent sale or supply of liquor in the state and that any extension of liability for the sale or supply of liquor beyond the historical limits of the Dramshop Act was a function of the legislature, not of the courts. The court further held that there was no common law cause of action based upon the willful and wanton misconduct by a tavern owner in connection with the sale or supply of alcohol, no matter how egregious the underlying facts of the cause of action were.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed from orders of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which permanently enjoined plaintiff from enforcing its noise nuisance ordinance and awarded attorney fees to defendant citizen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city filed a complaint against defendant citizen, alleging that he had operated his auto repair shop in such a manner as to constitute a noise nuisance in violation of section 21 - 20 of plaintiff's nuisance ordinance. Defendant sought a declaratory judgment that ordinance 89 - 108, the noise ordinance, was unconstitutional, on grounds that it was so vague and/or overly broad as to deny him due process of law. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court granted defendant's motion and permanently enjoined plaintiff from enforcing its noise ordinance against defendant. The court held that plaintiff's noise ordinance, which provided neither the notice nor the standards required by due process guarantees, and the language of the ordinance, even when considered in its everyday context, failed to convey what constituted a nuisance and, therefore, was prohibited; thus, the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that since defendant had not shown any basis for the fees granted to him by the trial court, the court concluded that the fee award was improper and must be reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the part of the order of the trial court that granted a permanent injunction against enforcement of ordinance No. 89 - 108 by plaintiff city. The court reversed the award of attorney fees granted to appellee because he did not show a basis to be awarded attorney fees by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant estate administrator challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted appellee city's motion to dismiss in the administrator's action to recover estate property allegedly taken unconstitutionally by the city. Decedent's taxicab operator's license, formerly assignable, was taken by the city after decedent's death upon the passing of a city ordinance making all operators' licenses non-assignable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent when alive had a taxicab operator's license at a time the city's ordinances made such licenses assignable and even devisable for only a minor fee; the licenses themselves had a market value up to $ 27,000. An ordinance was passed making the licenses nonassignable, and two days after decedent's passing; city representative took his license. Six years later, after several unfavorable federal court rulings, an amended ordinance made the licenses assignable once more. But when appellant estate administrator sought to recover the license, the trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the license was not &quot;property,&quot; and even it was, the city had the power to amend the nature of that property right. On review, the court held that even though the property right was created by legislative action, once created it could not be taken away without due process and just compensation even by statutory amendment. Undoubtedly, the license was constitutionally protected property; it could be owned, marketed, and transferred. The administrator had stated a viable cause of action. The statute of limitations defense, not argued until the appeal, was deemed waived.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 620 (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian represented a minor that suffered a brain injury when defendant doctor used forceps during the minor's birth. The trial court granted the health organization's motion to dismiss, finding that it was immune pursuant to &sect; 26 of the VHSPA. The appellate court reversed. The court found that the 1988 amendment to &sect; 26, eliminating the health organization's statutory immunity, was not applicable because it applied prospectively and the cause of action accrued prior to the amendment. The court held that the legislature had a rational basis for immunizing voluntary health services plans like the health organization under &sect; 26. However, the health organization was acting in a dual capacity as a health maintenance organization (HMO) and a voluntary health services plan when the minor was injured. The court concluded that it would be unconstitutional to apply &sect; 26 of the VHSPA to the health organization because it was acting also as an HMO, and it was not eligible to take advantage of the immunity that its charter with the VHSPA allowed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reasoned that &sect; 4-103(a)(1) of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-103(a)(1) (1987), was unconstitutional. The supreme court vacated the trial court's judgment on the grounds that the statute was constitutional. On remand, defendant claimed that her conviction under the statute violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. The court affirmed the convictions because there was no violation of double jeopardy. The court reasoned that the trial court's initial dismissal of the charge was not a decision based on the merits but was instead a dismissal unrelated to guilt or innocence. Therefore, defendant was neither convicted nor acquitted and double jeopardy did not bar the prosecution. Also, the convictions did not violate double jeopardy because the judgment on the charge of armed violence was proper based upon defendant's conviction for theft of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the board's determination. The issue on appeal was whether the board erred in holding that the conversion from a chiropractor's office to a dentist's office was a prohibited change from one nonconforming use to another and not the continuation of a lawful prior nonconforming use. The court affirmed the judgment against the property owners. The court concluded that the board's strict construction of the zoning ordinance to require identity of use rather than similarity was not clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or unreasonable. The court also concluded that the zoning ordinance was not unconstitutional as applied to the property in question because the restriction on changes from one nonconforming use to another was rationally related to bringing the neighborhood into conformity with a valid exercise of the county's zoning power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed a portion of the ruling of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which affirmed the denial by defendant, the Department of Revenue, of real estate tax exemption claimed for four contiguous parcels of land. The Department appealed that portion of the circuit court's ruling that overruled its decision that two buildings located on the land were likewise not entitled to tax exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the acquisition of all of a sublessor's rights, title, and interest in two buildings, which were used solely for municipal purposes, the city became sublessee of the land owned by the lessor and responsible for property taxes. The city sought to have the land and the buildings exempted from property taxes, asserting that the property was owned by a unit of local government and was entitled to exemption under &sect; 19.6 of the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 500, 500.6 (1987) because it produced no income. However, the Department argued that, despite municipality ownership of the buildings, the land and the buildings could not be severed for tax status purposes. In affirming the judgment, the court found that any ruling that exempted the city leased land from taxation violated Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 6, which expressly limited the legislature's powers of tax exemption to city owned. Thus, city leased property could not be exempt from taxation. However, because the city did own the buildings and because the severance of property interests for exemption purposes was allowed, the circuit court properly accorded the buildings tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a company, Illinois Attorney General, an agency, and a board, sought review of an order by appellee Illinois Commerce Commission (commission), which determined that only 27.2 percent of the nuclear power electrical generation station was used and useful and that the deferred assets account balance was to be reduced by $ 101,644,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company and the attorney general challenged the commission's determination that only 27.2 percent of the station was used and useful for purposes of inclusion in the company's rate base. The company contended that the commission's decision to reduce, for ratemaking purposes, the deferred assets account balance was wrong as a matter of law. After review of cases and commission decisions, and the provision in the last paragraph of &sect; 9 -- 215 of the amended Public Utilities Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 9 -- 215 (1989), the court held that the commission erred in using the needed and economic benefits tests to determine whether and what portion of the station was used and useful for purposes of inclusion in the company's rate base. The court reversed the commission's decision on the used and useful issue because the determination was to be based on established pre-1986 standards. The court reversed the commission's determination that the deferred assets account balance must have been reduced because the court found that the commission misapplied the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 92. In all other respects, the court affirmed the commission's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the portion of the order for further proceedings on the issue of whether and/or what portion of the station was used and useful. In addition, the court reversed the commission's decision to reduce, for ratemaking purposes, the deferred assets account balance by $ 101,644,000. In all other respects, the court affirmed the commission's order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed the petition pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 510.1 (1987), and awarded the wife one-half of the husband's pension and $ 1,000 toward her attorney fees. After the husband filed notice of appeal, the trial court granted the wife's motion for attorney fees on appeal. The husband appealed, contending that the trial court erred in finding that he had failed to prove the affirmative defense set forth in Ill. Rev.

The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and held that the trial court erred in rejecting the husband's affirmative defense and that the trial court was within its discretion in requiring the husband to pay the wife's attorney fees in the amount awarded. Although no division of the husband's military retirement pension was made in a settlement agreement or judgment of dissolution, the original disposition of military retirement benefits was part of a carefully derived plan that was fair to both parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment stemmed from charges that defendant discharged toxic waste into a public sewer system. A prior indictment based upon the same incidents was nolprossed. Defendant contended that the counts were barred by prior prosecutions based on double jeopardy because the elements of the offenses were identical. The court held that the original offense, violation of Addison Village, Ill. Code &sect; 23.13, and the offenses charged in the case at bar, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, paras. 1044(c)(1), (e)(1), were sufficiently different to make them separate offenses. Ch. 111 1/2, paras. 1044(c)(1), (e)(1) required proof of a knowing disposal and delivery of hazardous waste, whereas the village ordinance required no such proof as to mental state and was an absolute liability offense. Also, the village's ordinance was regulatory, not penal and the ordinance required proof of a fact that the statute did not. Therefore, under the Jackson test, the court found that the pertinent ordinance and statute dealt with separate offenses and defendant's prosecution was not barred by the prohibition against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consolidated appeals were in regard to the village's enforcement of an ordinance that prohibited certain business activities on Sundays.

The village argued that the exemptions to the ordinance were reasonable and that it was reasonable to distinguish among manufacturing, retail, and construction businesses. The court found 1) that the ordinance was not vague as to whether the rental of videocassettes and the sale of truck washes were permitted on Sundays, as it was clear that those activities were prohibited; 2) that the ordinance was not an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch; 3) that the ordinance had a rational relationship to the objective of promoting peace and quiet and that the businesses did not demonstrated an equal protection violation; and 4) that the ordinance did not have an irrational number of exemptions and was a reasonable exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the first-degree murder statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1 (1985), violated due process, equal protection, or separation of powers. The court affirmed the defendant's conviction and sentence, as the first-decree murder statute was not unconstitutional and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing him. The court concluded that that the statute had no presumption of guilt that defendant had to rebut. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel because defense counsel failed to tender an involuntary manslaughter instruction, as no evidence existed that warranted the instruction. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing defendant's proffered instruction that modified the accomplice-witness instruction and misstated the law. Defendant failed to prove that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to 60 years.</SPAN></P>

No direct appeal was taken from the guilty plea or sentence, but defendant filed a post-conviction petition, claiming that the conviction was unconstitutional.

Stat. ch. 38, para. 21 -- 1 and armed violence based upon criminal damage to property, after he fired six shots into a hotel room door. Defendant pled guilty to armed violence, and the State dropped the charge of criminal damage to property. Defendant claimed that his conviction was void because the offense of armed violence could not be predicated constitutionally on the offense of criminal damage to property. In affirming the judgment that dismissed defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, the court rejected defendant's argument and ruled that: (1) the crime of criminal damage to property had already been found to be a proper predicate felony for an armed violence conviction and cases from the Illinois Supreme Court that indicated otherwise were distinguishable and inapplicable because defendant's conduct was premeditated and voluntary and the deterrent purpose of the armed violence statute was served; (2) the legislature was not precluded from punishing more severely someone who damaged property while carrying a dangerous weapon, and the statutory scheme producing that result was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court awarded custody to the grandparents and visitation rights to the mother. On the mother's motion for reconsideration, the circuit court appointed the grandparents as co-guardians. The mother appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that the mother's equal protection challenge under &sect; 11-7 was not persuasive. Section 11-7 embodied the superior rights doctrine. The child was removed from the mother on a showing that she was not fit. The mother was accorded a full evidentiary hearing. The argument that the grandparents lacked standing was waived, but the court found that standing existed because the grandparents had standing to commence the guardianship action.

On appeal, defendant argued that his conviction had to be vacated because the possession of stolen motor vehicle statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-103(a)(1), violated due process and the guarantee of proportionate penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the possession of a stolen motor vehicle statute was unconstitutional because it did not use a reasonable method to further or protect the state interest for which it was enacted. Defendant further contended that the offense was a lesser-included offense of theft, and, therefore, imposition of a greater penalty violated the Illinois Constitutional requirement of proportionate penalties. The court disagreed. The court noted that the Illinois Supreme Court had held that the statute did not violate the due process and proportionate penalty clauses of the Illinois Constitution and that the statute applied to all persons, including organized motor vehicle thieves. The court noted that the Illinois Supreme Court had concluded that all persons who possessed a stolen motor vehicle, including organized motor vehicle thieves, were punishable under the statute and that the steady increase in the penalty provision for possession of a stolen motor vehicle was indicative of the legislature's intent to make possession of a stolen motor vehicle a separate, more serious offense than theft, rather than a lesser included offense of theft.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction arguing that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he possessed a book containing child pornography with the intent to disseminate it, and that as he was indicted under the amended child pornography statute providing it was illegal to possess child pornography, application of the amended statute was a violation of ex post facto law. Despite defendant's argument that application of the amended statute constituted an ex post fact violation, the court affirmed defendant's conviction because although defendant's possession of the child pornography occurred before the amendment to the statute, defendant violated the statute by his continued possession of the book.

The court agreed with defendant's primary contention that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the burden of proof for a finding of GBMI. Accordingly, the court reversed defendant's conviction, and remanded the matter for a new trial. The court reasoned that the trial court mistakenly instructed the jury that the preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the reasonable doubt standard, applied in determining defendant's sanity. The court noted that the GBMI verdict required the state to prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: that defendant committed the act, that defendant was not insane, and that defendant was mentally ill. The state conceded that the instruction given by the trial court misstated the burden of proof, but argued that the error was harmless because defendant would have been found GBMI even with the proper instruction. The court held that the error was not harmless because the altered GBMI instruction might have affected the outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 111 2/3, para. 188 et seq. (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the city began road improvements it became necessary for the local water district to move its water mains. When the city refused to reimburse the district for its expenses, the district argued that the easement for the pipes granted under &sect; 9 of the Act, Ill. Rev.

The trial court did not agree and granted the city a summary judgment. On review the court held that any franchise rights granted to the district by the city or by the city as an agent of the state were given subject to the inherent police powers of the state as the sovereign. It held that a city could not lawfully grant any rights or privileges which were inconsistent with the public necessities or surrender its rights to control the public streets. Because the utility's rights under the franchise ordinance were taken subject to the city's police power, the city's subsequent exercise of that power in improving the roads did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of the district's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was injured when her car overturned on an S curve on a road owned by the township and located in the county. The driver filed a complaint and alleged that defendants knew or should have known of the unreasonably dangerous condition of the road and that they negligently and carelessly failed to warn the motorists of the condition. The trial court granted summary judgment for the township and dismissed the complaint against the remaining defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment and dismissal of the complaint. The court held that the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 2-201 (1987), which provided immunity to a public employee for acts or omissions within the exercise of his discretion, protected the township highway commissioner and the county superintendent of highways from liability to the driver because the placement of the warning sign before the curve was an exercise of their discretion. Because the individual employees were not liable, the court held that the township and the county could not be held liable under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 2-109 (1987).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a conviction and sentence entered in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Illinois). He had been convicted of possession of a car title without a complete assignment, in violation of &sect; 4-104(b)(1), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95, para. 4-104(b) (1987), which was a Class 4 felony. His pretrial motion to dismiss on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold a used car to another man. The title did not have his name on it, and he refused to put his name on it or refund the buyer's money. Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 4-104(b). The face of the title did not define or explain a complete assignment, and it did not include any warning that the failure to assign the title to a specific person was a violation of the law. The trial judge noted that while it was not clear on the face of the title what a person's obligation was, there was no valid reason for not completing it. On appeal, defendant challenged the statute's constitutionality, asserting first that the offense of violating &sect; 4-104(b) was punished more harshly than other similar or related offenses requiring a greater degree of culpability. The court rejected the argument that the sentencing scheme violated the state constitution's proportional penalties clause. Defendant also argued that the statute was overly broad. The court agreed that, because the statute required no criminal intent, it punished innocent conduct. The breadth of the statute was far greater than needed to achieve the underlying purpose of the statute, to prevent auto theft.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 9--1(a) and his sentence for 22 years' imprisonment by the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois). Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense and second-degree murder and also alleged that the second-degree murder statute in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9--2(a) (1987) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was an unregistered guest at a hotel where the victim worked as a clerk, was being led out of the hotel when he admitted to stabbing the victim in the back. The victim died as a result of the stabbing, but identified defendant as the perpetrator before he died. Defendant alleged that the victim was shoving him down the stairs and also had told other persons that he was a homosexual. The trial court refused to give to the jury defendant's jury instructions for self-defense and second-degree murder. The court affirmed defendant's sentence and conviction for first-degree murder. The court held that the proposed jury instructions were not appropriate because defendant presented very little evidence that the victim threatened him with unlawful force and because defendant did not allege that he believed he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm sufficient to justify his use of a knife on the victim. The court also held that the second-degree murder statute in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9--2(a) did not violate a defendant's constitutional rights because requiring a defendant to prove a mitigating factor did not violate a defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, an amended complaint was filed, and after defendant filed an answer and a counterclaim, the village responded and filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and a motion to dismiss the countercomplaint. The court entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the village on two counts of its complaint and dismissed the countercomplaint. The property owner filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that village was entitled to judgment on the pleadings because the property owner admitted that the size of his garage exceeded the requirements in the ordinance. The court held that the other issues raised on appeal were waived because the record on appeal did not demonstrate the errors of which the property owner complained, and the errors were not included in his prayer for relief.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 215, to submit to a CT scan under sedation by chloral hydrate and held the minor's mother and attorneys in contempt for their refusal to comply with the order. 87 Ill. 2d R. 215.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice action, the minor, by his mother, claimed that his severe and permanent brain damage was caused by injuries sustained during his birth at defendant hospital. The hospital requested a Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 215 examination by CT scan while the minor was sedated to determine if the minor suffered from congenital schizencephaly. The trial court ordered the examination and held the minor's mother and attorneys in contempt for the minor's failure to submit to the CT scan. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The successor trial judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering the minor to submit to a CT scan under sedation because chloral hydrate was routinely and safely used, the risks of life-threatening complications were negligible, and the minor presented no evidence of harm that would result from the CT scan. The court required, however, that the order specify the dosage of chloral hydrate to be administered, the names of the physicians who would perform the CT scan, and the precautions to be taken in the event of an emergency. The court rejected the constitutional issues raised in the amici curiae brief as meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the murder of the victim and, at a subsequent reinstatement hearing, was found fit for trial and was tried before a jury. Following instructions to the jury on the verdicts of guilty, not guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity, and guilty but mentally ill (GBMI), the jury found defendant guilty of murder. Defendant argued that authorizing the jury to find him guilty but mentally ill introduced into the jury's fact-finding task a consideration that diverted the jury's attention from its primary task of determining his guilt or innocence. The court held that defendant's right to due process was not denied by the submission of a GBMI instruction to the jury. Defendant next argued that the trial court erred by failing to properly instruct the jury on the statutory elements and burden of proof for the guilty but mentally ill verdict. The court found that the instruction was defective and constituted plain error because it failed to place the burden on the State to prove that defendant was not insane beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further ruled that the defect was substantial, and that it was not waived by defendant's failure to make a timely objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' daughter, then age two, was removed from their home after it was found that the father had sexually abused two older girls and that the mother, who had serious mental limitations, was unable to respond to the situation. The trial court also found that the child's environment had caused serious delays in her development. Almost two years later, the trial court found that the parents were unfit as defined by the Adoption Act and terminated their parental rights. The parents appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the Adoption Act was constitutional where it was rationally related to the goal of protecting children, and not all parents with disabilities were affected, only those who could not discharge their parental responsibilities. The court concluded that one of the main reasons the child was adjudicated abused was the mother's inability to protect her or to understand how to deal appropriately with the allegations of sexual abuse. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to establish the mother's inability to discharge her parental responsibilities. The father's failure to comply with a counseling plan supported the finding that he was unfit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed suit against the credit bureaus claiming that the wage garnishment notices they served did not comply with the Illinois Wage Assignment Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 39.2b (1987). The employee sought certification as a class action lawsuit. The trial court certified the class, and the credit bureaus appealed. The court reversed and remanded. Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-801, a class action could be maintained only if there were questions of fact or law common to the class, which predominated over any questions affecting only individual members. Here, those affected by violations of the Act were entitled to recover not only a statutory penalty but also compensatory damages. The compensatory damages issue could only be determined on an individual basis as to each person injured by a violation of the Act. Though the existence of an individual question did not necessarily defeat a class action, where that individual question was more time consuming and more difficult to prove, as was the case with compensatory damages, than the common question which was readily proved, maintenance of the suit as a class action was not permissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the newspaper's reporters was in court on the day scheduled for the adjudicatory hearing of two minors who were the victims of parental physical and sexual abuse. The trial judge ordered the reporter from the courtroom when the reporter identified himself and denied the reporter an immediate hearing on the exclusion order. Following a hearing on the newspaper's motion for reconsideration that enjoined the newspaper from disclosing the minors' identities, the newspaper appealed. The court determined that the newspaper could not be restrained from publishing information that it obtained through common reportorial techniques, but the trial court could exclude the newspaper from the proceedings even without the parties' request for exclusion, holding that the court as parens patriae had a duty to protect a minor when danger of harm was perceived. The state's interest in protecting the minors was compelling, and the trial court properly exercised its discretion under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 801-5(6) (1989). The press did not have an absolute right of access to juvenile proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the statute sufficiently restricted an officer's ability to arrest individuals under the statute and thus did not encourage arbitrary enforcement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coal mining company contended that the IDMM had no authority under the Illinois Surface Coal Mining Land Conservation and Reclamation Act (Illinois Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 96 1/2, par. 7901.01 et seq. (1981) to require the repair or restoration of structures damaged by subsidence because the Illinois Act authorized only those standards which complied with the Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Federal Act), 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1201 et seq., and there were no promulgated Federal Act standards. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the coal mining company was required, through the Illinois Act, to repair and restore structures damaged by subsidence. The court found that because 30 C.F.R. &sect; 817.121(c)(2) deferred to state law on the subject, the IDMM had authority under &sect; 1.02(b), Ill. Rev.

Because &sect; 817.121(c)(2) recognized that state law may require repair or restoration of structures damaged by subsidence, the IDMM requirements promulgated under the Illinois Act were in compliance with the Federal Act.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor, defense counsel, defendant, judge, the child, and the child's mother were in the judge's chambers during the child's testimony, which was broadcast into the courtroom for the jury. Defendant was not screened from the child's sight.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder, armed violence, and felony theft, and sentenced to concurrent life and four five-tear terms of imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court and ordered the mittimus corrected. The court held that appellant was not subjected to an illegal arrest or compelled to make a statement involuntarily, and therefore evidence obtained as a result of his detention and statement was admissible. The court stated that there was proof that the value of items stolen were valued at more than $ 300, warranting felony theft instead of misdemeanor theft convictions. The court stated that rulings of the trial court were not violative of the federal or state constitutions. The court ruled that the imposition of the natural life sentence without consideration of factors in mitigation was not in violation of federal constitutional guarantees; the court also rejected appellant's contention that he was improperly sentenced under a mandatory life statute. The court further held, however, that two counts of murder merged into other murder counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and ordered the mittimus corrected. The convictions for murder, felony theft, and armed violence were valid as admitted evidence was not illegally obtained, items stolen were valued in excess of $ 300, and the trial rulings and the sentences were not violative of the sate and federal constitutional guarantees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant village sought review of the order of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which granted the request of appellees, sand pit owners and sand hauler, for a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of an ordinance enacted by the village that placed a weight limit on the one road within the village limits that appellees used in their business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance restricting the weight of trucks also had a provision for issuance of a permit to trucks over the weight limit upon payment of a fee. On appeal, the village argued that appellees had an adequate remedy in that they could continue to operate during pendency of their challenge of the ordinance by obtaining a permit. The court found that the cost of the permit would make the sand hauling business uneconomical, thereby causing appellees irreparable harm. The court found that this evidence supported the trial court's determination that obtaining a permit did not constitute an adequate legal remedy. The court rejected the village's argument that appellees had not proved they would prevail on the merits, stating that the movant had only to raise a fair question about the existence of his rights. The court found that appellees had met this burden by showing that the municipality had no power to impose a tax or license fee and that the permit fee could not be sustained because it was not related to enforcement of the ordinance but was meant to compensate the municipality for paving the road more frequently than would otherwise be required if it were not used by heavy trucks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the preliminary injunction barring the village's enforcement of an ordinance that restricted the weight of trucks that could use a certain road except upon payment of a permit fee. The court found that obtaining a permit pursuant to the ordinance did not constitute an adequate legal remedy and that appellees had raised a fair question as to the validity of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to prove his guilt of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed, concluding that there was ample evidence to support the verdict. A witness' identification of defendant as her daughter's assailant was corroborated by other witness testimony, physical evidence, and by defendant's statements. Given the variety and strength of the evidence against defendant, the court could not say that the trial court's determination of guilt was in error. Because defendant was not within the class of persons identified as falling into the gap between &quot;preponderance&quot; and &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; the statutory scheme had been applied constitutionally to him. The court determined that the evidence was sufficient to conclude that defendant did knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a revenue ruling, the city attempted to collect the transaction tax (tax) against operators of self-service car washes, but not against operators of tunnel or automatic car washes. The owner asserted that this was a violation of the state and federal constitutions. The circuit court granted summary judgment to the city. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the customer's use of the owner's equipment at the owner's facility did not constitute a &quot;lease&quot; of personal property subject to the tax, thus the ruling was an illegal expansion of the terms of the ordinance. The court found that the ruling made an artificial distinction between the owner and competitors based solely on the customer's hands-on participation in the owner's wash process. The court held that this distinction was arbitrary and based on no real or substantial difference, thus it violated the intent of the ordinance and the uniformity requirements of Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

The landowner filed suit against defendant zoning board of appeals of the City of Geneva (board) and others after her application for a rear-yard variance to enable her to build a single-family residence on her property was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner contended that: (1) count VI alleging that the board's meeting was held in violation of the Open Meetings Act (act), Ill.

The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. In so ruling, the court concluded that count VI was timely filed, and remanded with instructions to reinstate that count. The court affirmed the dismissal of the city and individual board members because the board, not the city, was responsible for the application of the zoning code and the city made no administrative decision to be reviewed; and the landowner provided no cognizable argument why the dismissal of the members was error. The court also found error in the dismissal of count IV because it sufficiently alleged a due process violation, and in count V that sought reversal of the board's decision and a variance.</SPAN></P>

This was done after the Federal Drug Administration had withdrawn its approval of the lens and the hospital was so informed. The patient subsequently lost vision in his left eye and incurred damages. The trial court granted the hospital's motion to dismiss the patient's complaint because the patient did not comply with &sect; 6 -- 622 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-622 (1989) in that the complaint lacked the necessary affidavit attesting to the soundness of the complaint. The patient argued that his complaint did not fall within the statute's purview because it sounded in administrative hospital negligence, not in healing art malpractice. The court held that the hospital's alleged negligence was based on conduct that was not measured by common knowledge but required medical knowledge. As such, the patient was required to comply with the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of delivery of more than 30 grams of a controlled substance. Defendant was indicted and initially tried in a bench trial with two co-defendants.

The State conceded that defendant was entitled to a new trial based on the jury statute being declared unconstitutional. Prior to the retrial, defendant attempted to waive a jury, but the State invoked its right to a jury under a statute later found to be unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to two years' probation, 200 hours of community service and a $ 7,500 fine for violating &sect; 44(j)(1)(A) of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1044(j)(1)(A) (1989), by pumping gasoline from an underground storage tank into the town sewer. Defendant appealed, arguing that subsection 44(j)(1)(A) was unconstitutional in that it was vague, ambiguous, and subject to arbitrary enforcement and that the state failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because the state failed to prove that defendant knew he was pumping gasoline. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that &sect; 44(j)(1)(A) was not unconstitutionally vague when it was read together with the appropriate sections of the Federal Pollution Control Act. The court found that the relevant statutory provisions considered as a unit were sufficiently clear and precise in defining the offense under &sect; 44(j)(1)(A). The court found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly violated subsection 12(f) of the Act, because at some time during the pumping process, defendant had knowledge that he was pumping gasoline.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant was not surprised by the technical amendment made to the information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue defendant raised on appeal was whether the requirement under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9 -- 2 (1987) that defendant show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he acted under sudden and intense passion to be convicted of second-degree rather than first-degree murder violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.The court concluded that the statute was constitutional because it did not require defendant to prove any elements of first-degree murder. Defendant contended that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed burglary by entering his wife's car with intent to commit a theft therein because the evidence showed he had driven his wife's car on prior occasions with her permission. Although the car was marital property, the court concluded that defendant was properly convicted of burglary. Defendant also argued that the 40-year sentence was excessive because the circuit court failed to consider his potential for rehabilitation, his age, and work record. The court found that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it sentenced defendant to 40 years' imprisonment for first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

They noticed that the steering column had been &quot;peeled,&quot; ran a computer check of the car, and learned that it had been reported as stolen. Defendant told the officers that he did not know to whom the car belonged. Defendant was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle. At trial he testified that a man at a local beach had lent him the car to get beer and that he did not know the car was stolen or that the steering column had been damaged. The trial court convicted him of violating para. 4-103(a)(1). On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction because, under the statute, an inference of defendant's knowledge that the vehicle had been stolen could be drawn from the fact of his exclusive possession of the car. The court upheld the legality of the statutory inference because it was not irrefutable and could be rebutted by defendant's explanation. The court found that defendant's explanation that he had obtained a car from a man he had never seen before, and that he did not see that the steering column was &quot;peeled,&quot; strained belief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted defendant for theft of a motor vehicle and possession of a stolen motor vehicle and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Defendant's conviction had previously been reversed by the court. Subsequently the court's reversal was reversed by the state supreme court and remanded to court. On remand, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court's finding that under the totality of circumstances defendant had intended to permanently deprive the automobile's owner of possession of the automobile was supported by the evidence. However, the court vacated defendant's sentence of imprisonment and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. The court held that the trial court had no discretion to grant a substance abuse evaluation under the Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Act (act), Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance which prohibited devices capable of awarding prizes or money from being located on the premises of licensed liquor establishments. The city's liquor control officer issued letters to all holders of liquor licenses in the city informing them of the ordinance and that the use of poker machines, card machines, or any game or similar machine or device was to be abated immediately. The owners filed an action against the city for declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of an ordinance. The trial court denied any relief to the owners. The owners appealed, contending that their electronic video poker machines were not within the class of machines covered by the ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the trial court's finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the owners' machines fell outside the class of machines prohibited by the city's ordinance. The parties stipulated that the ordinance was intended to prevent gambling. No evidence was offered to sustain the proposition that the ordinance was intended to create a prohibition on all poker and card machines incapable of awarding prizes or money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court, County of Brown (Illinois), which convicted him of aggravated battery &quot;on or about a public way,&quot; Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4(b)(8) (1987). He argued that the statute was unconstitutional for overbreadth and vagueness. Plaintiff, the People of the State of Illinois, contended that the phrase &quot;on or about a public way&quot; was consistent with its legislative intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that the constitutionality of the Illinois aggravated battery statute had been upheld under both due process and equal protection challenges. A statute only need be sufficiently certain to give fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that his contemplated conduct was forbidden by law. The court held that the legislature wanted the courts to have broad discretion to determine whether a person committed a battery &quot;on or about a public way,&quot; and chose flexible terms in order to insure the broad protection of the public health and safety. The court determined that the definition given by the circuit court of &quot;about,&quot; as the immediate neighborhood of or near, was a permissible definition. The court found that defendant's contention that the more appropriate definition would have been &quot;immediately adjacent to the public way; so close to the public way as to interfere with the public's travel&quot; was without merit. To limit the meaning to the definition offered by defendant would be in direct conflict with the legislature's intent. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision and conviction of the circuit court. The court rejected the constitutional challenges to the statute and found sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that a battery occurred &quot;on or about a public way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for a new trial, and the circuit court vacated a theft conviction. The appellate court affirmed the stolen possession conviction. The court first rejected the state's argument that defendant waived the constitutionality issue by not raising it in the circuit court. Defendant raised the issue in his new trial motion, and regardless, recent law held that the constitutionality of a statute could have been challenged for the first time on appeal. However, all of defendant's constitutional arguments had previously been heard by the courts and rejected. The statute did not violate due process, and it did not create a disproportionate penalty given the legislature's concern that vehicle theft was a greater crime than ordinary theft. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it allegedly had contradictory mental states required scienter and constructive knowledge. The statute only created an evidentiary presumption, not a mental state of constructive knowledge.</SPAN></P>

Prior to the hearing defendant was in the courtroom but left and did not return. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that it was not reversible error for the trial court to resentence defendant in his absence because the trial court twice advised defendant that his trial would proceed in his absence if he failed to appear at any hearing in the matter and the sentencing hearing was part of the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois), in which he was found guilty but mentally ill on each count of attempted murder and armed violence for an attack upon his wife. He was sentenced for nine years concurrently. He was first declared unfit to stand trial. After a second examination, he was declared fit. He appealed his convictions on various grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the constitutionality, as applied to him, of the Illinois law of insanity and mental illness. He contended that &sect; 6 -- 2 of the Criminal Code of 1961, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 6 -- 2 (1987), and &sect; 115 -- 4(j) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115 -- 4(j) (1987), violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. On appeal, the court found that those sections did not threaten a constitutional right and limited its inquiry to whether the &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; (GBMI) classification had a rational basis. The court could not discern the impermissible classification involved and found no equal protection violation. The court also held that because no fundamental constitutional right was threatened, its review for substantive due process purposes involved only the reasonableness of the law. The court found the GBMI statute was rationally designed to accomplish the legislative goal of reducing the number of persons erroneously found not guilty by reason of insanity and to characterize such defendants as in need of treatment. The court affirmed judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, which did not err when: it found no violation of defendant's right to a speedy trial; it admitted the state's expert's testimony on sanity; it found that defendant was mentally ill beyond a reasonable doubt; it found the legal provisions on insanity, mental illness, and &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; verdict constitutional; and it removed two prospective jurors for cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant initially contended that he was denied due process by the state's failure to institute formal probation revocation proceedings in an underlying misdemeanor action for which he had been charged, and for which, after entering a negotiated agreement, he was serving probation. The trial court found that the misdemeanor charge and the probation sentence imposed were separate and distinct from the felony charges the state elected to file. On appeal, the court held that the state's charging action, viewed in its entirety, complied with due process. Following verification of the negative probation reports, the state was free to file either a revocation of probation petition or the remaining felony charges for different offenses against defendant under the plea agreement. Defendant contended that the misdemeanor action barred the felony action under the doctrine of double jeopardy. The court disagreed. The statutory elements of the charged offenses were distinct. Each offense required proof of a fact which the other did not, they did not constitute the same offense. The court also did not find the alleged prosecutorial vindictiveness, or a wrongful substitution of the trial judge.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and the court affirmed his convictions, holding that because defendant did not request that his previously appointed counsel be present while he was being interrogated about the instant crimes and the record did not indicate that defendant was pressured into confessing to his involvement in them, defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his Fifth Amendment rights and thus admission of the statement was proper. The court found that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of an unrelated warrant because it was necessary to establish the steps leading up to defendant's confession in the instant crimes and that defendant failed to preserve error and/or sustain his burden of proof on his remaining claims on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant did not object at trial, nor did he object in his post-trial motion. Defendant thus waived the alleged error. The court found that the plain error exception to the waiver rule did not apply because the evidence was not closely balanced, and defendant's substantial rights were not affected. Defendant also objected to the introduction of testimony as to other crimes that he committed. The court found that such evidence was inadmissible to show defendant's propensity for committing crimes but admissible for the purpose of showing motive and modus operandi, as well as to demonstrate defendant's dislike of the victim. Defendant also objected to the trial court's refusal to permit an offer of proof related to the testimony of a prosecution witness.

Defendant was convicted of three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Defendant was not entitled to have the jury instructed as to the necessity of the state proving beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of each of the mental states implied by &sect; 4-3(a) of the Criminal Code of 1961, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 4-3(a) (1987). By the terms of &sect; 4-3(a), the state was required to prove a mental state for each of the elements of the offense of aggravated criminal sexual assault even though no such mental states were expressly set forth in the statutory language defining the offense. The mental state implied by &sect; 4-3 necessarily accompanied the prohibited elements of the offense of sexual assault. The implied mental states were not specific enough to require instruction to a jury, and the circuit court did not err in giving the pattern instructions, which did not set forth those mental states.</SPAN></P>

The decedent was stabbed 89 times and the other victim was stabbed 7 times. His sentence for the murder was an 80-year extended-term sentence. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision and rejected defendant's contention that the probable existence of a diminished mental state was a strong mitigating factor. He argued that he may have been entitled to voluntary manslaughter instructions predicated upon the sudden, intense passion provoked in him by the sight of the woman he loved in the arms of another man. The court held that defendant's acts were not provoked by a sudden and intense passion because he had previously made remarks to his supervisor that he might kill the decedent if he found out that she was seeing someone else. The court concluded that the record showed that defendant's sentence was not affected by a victim impact statement linking the decedent's brother's suicide to the murder of the decedent.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005--6--3.1(f) (1983), and sought contempt sanctions against appellees in their administration of the law. The second appeal challenged the trial court's order of a new trial. The circuit court dismissed the prisoner's motion for contempt sanctions, reinstated an expungement order and denied the prisoner's motion to designate the proceedings as a class action, and the prisoner sought review. On appeal, the court held that the order denying the prisoner's motion to designate the proceeding as a class action, vacating the sentence, and setting the matter for trial was not a final order and therefore was not appealable. The court held that even if the trial court's order was final, the prisoner's notice of appeal was premature, either under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 303(a)(1) on civil appeals or under Ill. Sup. Ct.

The biological father claimed to be the child's father because he lived with and had sexual intercourse with the child's mother during the time when the child was conceived. He also claimed that the child's mother told him that he was the father, he had visited the child, and contributed to the child's support. The former husband and the guardian ad litem both filed motions to dismiss the biological father's parentage petition on the ground that the two-year statute of limitations of the Act barred his claim. The court found that the parentage petition was filed about five years after the child's birth, about 22 months after the Act was passed and over 12 months after it was effective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant used a knife to force the victim into his vehicle to force her to have sex, but she escaped. The state supreme court had ruled that a conviction of armed violence based on unlawful restraint with the use of a category I weapon was disproportional because more serious offenses were punished less severely. The appellate court affirmed on the basis that it did not have to review new case law at all. The legislature cured the defect by adding the offense of aggravated unlawful restraint, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 10--3.1 (1987). With the new crime, there was a proportional structure between the different categories of unlawful restraint and kidnapping. With the new law, unlawful restraint could have risen to the level of aggravated unlawful restraint, a Class 3 felony. Simple kidnapping could have risen to the level of aggravated kidnapping, a Class 1 felony. Accordingly, at whatever level, unlawful restraint was punished as a less serious offense than kidnapping. In conclusion, there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suburban municipalities received their water supply from the city, and they claimed that the water rates charged by the city were excessive because they were not reasonably related to the cost of service. The court held that the suburban municipalities were entitled to a refund of costs attributable to sewer services but ruled that the water rates charged by the city were otherwise reasonable. In so holding, the court ruled that (1) the rates established by the city were legislative acts and were therefore entitled to a presumption of validity; (2) the method selected by the city for calculating the water rate was rationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose; (3) the suburban municipalities failed to carry their burden of proving that the rates were excessive and unreasonable; and (4) charging the suburban municipalities for costs attributable to the provision of sewer service was unreasonable because the suburban municipalities received no sewer service from the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company insisted that it was necessary to request insureds to take a polygraph test to detect whether they were attempting to defraud the company. The state director of insurance had promulgated an amendment to the insurance regulations to prohibit insurers from requesting or requiring the polygraph tests. The company filed an action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging that the director's amendment violated the Illinois Administrative Procedures Act (IAPA), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 1002 et seq. (1987). The trial court permanently enjoined the director from enforcing the amendment and denied his motion to dismiss and dissolve a temporary restraining order. The court reversed, finding that the director did not exceed his authority in promulgating the amendment. The court found that the proposed regulation did not unduly restrict the company's ability to conduct a claims investigation and that it was within the scope of the enabling statute, the Insurance Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, paras. 766.5, 766.6 (1987). The court found that the regulation was not unconstitutionally vague and the director did not violate the IAPA.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that the armed violence statute was not unconstitutionally applied to defendant. According to the court, the sentencing scheme that provided for a greater potential penalty for armed violence predicated upon aggravated battery than for second degree murder was not unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95, para. 4-103(b) was unconstitutional and that the cause of action should have been remanded for a Batson hearing because the state used its peremptory challenges to exclude all blacks from the jury. The court found that the statute was constitutional because it was reasonably designed to protect the public from the evils of the offense of possession of a stolen motor vehicle and its related activities. Remanding for a Batson hearing, the court held that the fact that one black person was an alternate juror did not show a lack of discrimination. The court found that because the state did not argue the untimeliness of defendant's objection to the use of peremptory challenges when defendant raised the issue at the conclusion of voir dire and in a post-trial motion, the state waived its argument regarding timeliness as it failed to raise the issue at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner school district appealed the order of respondent, Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board (board), and the board cross-petitioned for enforcement of its order. The school district argued that the employee evaluation plan required by the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act (Act) was not a mandatory subject of bargaining, that the union's charge was untimely, and that the union had waived its right to midterm bargaining.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union represented certified personnel in the school district. The collective bargaining agreement between the union and the school district contained a provision on the school district's employee evaluation plan (plan). Although the school district solicited opinions about the plan, the school district claimed the right to unilaterally change the plan. The union filed a grievance with the board. The board ordered the school district to bargain collectively on the plan. The school district appealed, and the board sought enforcement of its order. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court denied the board's cross petition. The court held that the Act did not mandate collective bargaining on all parts of the plan. The substantive criteria in the plan were not subject to mandatory bargaining, but the mechanical aspects of the evaluation process, such as timing and remediation, were. The union's charges were timely filed. The union did not waive its right to midterm bargaining by agreeing to the collective bargaining agreement. Section 16(c) of the Act was unconstitutional because it required the court to exercise original jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
