Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-114(2)(b)(iv) (1987), recodified as Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-119(8) (1989).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two corporations entered into a merger. The surviving corporation's deduction for net operating losses sustained by the two corporations was disallowed. The Board affirmed the decision. Pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-2-303, the corporation petitioned the district court for judicial review. The district court sustained the Board's findings. The court affirmed, holding that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-114(2)(b)(iv) (1987), recodified as Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-119(8) (1989) did not unconstitutionally discriminate against the surviving corporation of a corporate merger. The statute prohibited a deduction for net operating losses sustained prior to the merger The statute satisfied equal protection analysis. There were plausible policy reasons for legislative reluctance to allow the carryover of tax deductions in mergers. Disallowing the carryover of tax deductions prevented larger, profitable corporations from gaining a tax advantage by acquiring another corporation's losses. The court also found that the statute applied equally to all entities falling within the same classification. The statute prevented all merged corporations from deducting pre-merger net operating losses.</SPAN></P>

A license discipline contested case was instituted by the board against the veterinarian. The veterinarian filed a motion for summary judgment.

It further found that the drug was administered with the intent to affect the speed and performance of the horses during their races. The board concluded that the veterinarian administered the injections in violation of Mont. Admin. R. 8.22.1401(18) and Mont. Admin. R. 8.22.1501(11). The district court affirmed the board's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final order. On appeal, the court held that Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the District Court of Yellowstone County, Thirteenth Judicial District (Montana), of criminal endangerment, a felony, in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-207 and given a suspended sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. He appealed, arguing that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and that the district court erred in refusing to give his proffered instruction of the definition of substantial risk of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had severely beaten his girlfriend for three hours while he wore cowboy boots, kicking her in the head and all over her body. In considering his appeal, the court ruled that to establish a felony criminal endangerment, the State had to prove that defendant acted knowingly. Citing &sect; 45-2-101(33), which defined knowingly, the court ruled that the crime of criminal endangerment was committed when defendant was aware that there was a high probability that his conduct may have caused a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. By incorporating intent, a mental state adequately defined by statute, the legislature gave fair warning of the mental state required. The court ruled that &sect; 45-5-207 was constitutional and was not void on its face even though it did not contain a definition of substantial risk of death. It also was not vague as applied to defendant's case because a person of ordinarily intelligence would have understood that such conduct created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. The court further ruled that the jury was capable of understanding whether his conduct caused a substantial risk of death without his proffered instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the resentencing for his aggravated kidnapping conviction by the District Court of the Sixteenth Judicial District, Rosebud County (Montana). The district court resentenced defendant to 100 years' imprisonment for this conviction following remand by an opinion of the federal appeals court, which vacated defendant's prior death penalty sentence on due process grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of deliberate homicide under former Mont. Rev. Code &sect; 94-5-102 (1947), sexual intercourse without consent under former Mont. Rev. Code &sect; 94-5-503 (1947), and aggravated kidnapping under Mont. Rev. Code &sect; 94-5-303 (1947). After numerous appeals and petitions for habeas corpus, defendant's death sentence for the aggravated kidnapping conviction was vacated by the federal appeals court and the state resentenced defendant to 100 years to run consecutively to his other sentences. Defendant argued that the double jeopardy clauses of the Montana and United States Constitutions, as well as Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46-11-501 to -505, concerning lesser included offenses, barred his resentencing on the aggravated kidnapping conviction. The court disagreed and determined that the doctrine of res judicata applied because it had already determined the issue in the state's favor. Moreover, the court held that the state was not bound to accept defendant's conditional plea of guilty and that res judicata also barred defendant's racial discrimination and unequal treatment claim because the court had twice rejected those claims. Thus, the court affirmed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decision to sentence defendant to 100 years of imprisonment for aggravated kidnapping to run consecutively with his other sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student brought charges against a school district, alleging that its employee sexually assaulted her. The lower court dismissed the original and amended complaints on the grounds of sovereign immunity. On appeal, the court reversed and held that while there was no ambiguity in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-111, which unequivocally granted sovereign immunity to the school district, the school district's purchase of liability coverage insurance waived its immunity to the extent of the coverage granted by the pertinent insurance. The court therefore remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with its holding. The court further ruled that the lower court improperly failed to ruled on the student's claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, under the apparent impression that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-11 would also bar those claims. The court held that the lower court was required to make an analysis and apply the applicable law to determine whether the &sect; 1983 claims were barred. Finally, the court refused to determine the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-11 because that issue was not before the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank challenged an order from the District Court of Musselshell County, Fourteenth Judicial District (Montana), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, a county board of commissioners and the Department of Revenue, State of Montana. The bank sought a refund under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-16-601 of a bank-shares tax deficiency for five years and a refund of the original bank shares tax assessment collected for those years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank sought to recover reassessed tax paid under protest pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-402. Its case was dismissed. It then filed a claim for refund and an amended claim for refund with the board of commissioners and the Department under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-16-601. Those claims were denied by the commissioners on the ground that the issue had already been litigated under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-402. The bank next filed a complaint to recover both the original and reassessed taxes under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-16-601. On appeal of an order granting summary judgment in favor of the board of commissioners and the Department, the court affirmed. The court held that it was only when Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-402 was not available as a remedy that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-16-601 could be used in its place. The bank, having sought a remedy under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-402 and having failed in that effort, was prohibited from seeking such remedy under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-16-601. The court also held that Department was not prohibited from taxing federal obligations for the years at issue because the exemption for those obligations could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

He reached maximum medical improvement and claimant sought rehabilitation; however, the employer reduced his benefits despite the fact that the claimant was not ready to return to work. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that after the claimant had reached maximum medical improvement, the claimant was no longer temporarily totally disabled and was, therefore, ineligible for temporary total disability benefits. The claimant did meet the definition of a disabled worker, however, and became eligible for total rehabilitation benefits. The court concluded that under &sect; 39-71-1023, the claimant became eligible for total rehabilitation benefits where he had not returned to work. Under the provisions of the statute, the claimant was entitled to a continuation of total rehabilitation benefits until he received a decision from the department regarding his potential for rehabilitation. After the insurer gave notice to the department that a company had been designated as its rehabilitation provider, the claimant was entitled to total rehabilitation benefits for a period not to exceed 26 weeks, unless extended by the department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employees appealed from the decision of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County (Montana), which entered judgment in favor of defendants, a social services agency and the State of Montana, in the employees' claim for the failure of the agency to reimburse their accrued annual leave upon termination, and in their declaratory action for an finding that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-18-617(2) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were terminated from their employment with the agency because of pending criminal mischief charges pending against them. The employees requested hearings on the terminations, and the order to suspend employees was upheld, but the hearing examiner refused to issue the employees their accrued compensation until a final determination. The employees then waived their rights to a termination hearing and filed this action for reimbursement of their accrued leave. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that (1) the trial court correctly found that the employees had waived their right to a hearing on the forfeiture of their annual leave because they were told they could only request such after a final termination hearing, but instead they went directly to the trial court; (2) the employees were not precluded from challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 2-18-617(2) because constitutional issues were properly raised in the court, not in administrative agencies; and (3) the trial court was correct in finding that the court should not have assumed original jurisdiction because there existed no urgency or emergency to remove the matter from the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the trial court judgment which determined that the employees were precluded from challenging the constitutionality of a statute, and affirmed that portion which found that they had waived their right to a hearing on forfeiture of their leave benefits and that the court should not assumed original jurisdiction. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dancer was cited for violation of the ordinance after he was observed doing his performance at a club. Legal proceedings commenced in the city court and the dancer sought to dismiss. The dancer was found guilty and an appeal was had to the district court. The district court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and found the dancer guilty of violating the ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional based on state preemption of regulation of establishments state-licensed to sell alcoholic beverages under the Montana Alcoholic Beverage Code (code), Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-1-101 to 16-6-314. The Code applied to the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages within the club. However, the ordinance did not regulate the club's sale of alcoholic beverages but instead regulated the dancer's conduct in the club. Thus, the city had the authority to enact the ordinance and was not preempted by the code. Nor did the ordinance violate state or federal constitutional provisions because such ordinances were permitted if the state delegated its regulatory authority under the Twenty-First Amendment to the city, which it had.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Board of Public Education sought review of an order by the District Court of the First Judicial District, In and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff news media, held that the litigation exception under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-203(4) violated the public's right to know provided by Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9, and awarded the media attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relying on Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-203(4), which allowed a public agency to close its meeting when discussing litigation strategy, the board asked a reporter to leave when it began discussions via a telephone conference call on a possible court challenge to a governor's order relating to the board's administrative rules. The media filed an action for a declaratory judgment that &sect; 2-3-203(4) was unconstitutional because it violated the public's right to know under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. On appeal of the summary judgment in favor of the media, the court rejected the board's argument that its due process rights outweighed the public's right to know. The court noted that due process rights were extended to people, not state agencies. The court also noted that the constitution superceded any professional conduct rules relating to an attorney's protecting the confidences of a public board. Finding Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9 clear and applicable, the court affirmed the judgment that the board wrongfully closed its meeting to discuss potential litigation between two governmental entities. Affirming the award of attorney fees, the court remanded for a determination of the fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment, which declared a litigation exception to open meetings by state agencies unconstitutional, held that the board violated the public's right to know, affirmed the award of attorney fees to the media, and remanded for a determination of the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his conviction of intimidation was invalid because the State failed to show the constitutionally required elements of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-203(1)(c) and he was not represented by competent counsel, because his counsel failed to file a motion to suppress in regard to the search of defendant's apartment and failed to raise a constitutional objection to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-203. The court held that the threats that defendant made were not protected speech, in that he threatened to damage the saxophone and implied that he would injure the owner of the saxophone if the owner got the police involved. The court further determined that the search of defendant's apartment was made after a person, who had the authority to consent, agreed that the police could search the apartment, so more than likely the trial court would not have granted a motion to suppress had one been presented. The court additionally held that the failure of defendant's counsel to raise the constitutional question regarding &sect; 45-5-203 did not result in any injury to defendant, because as determined by the court, the speech of defendant contained in his threats was not protected.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance in question bore a reasonable relationship to the advancement of the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the community and constituted a valid exercise of the city's police power. If a municipality provided an adequate area for manufactured home development, manufactured homes could be excluded from conventional residential districts. The city's ordinance provided an adequate area for manufactured home development.

Appellant natural father did not consent. Following a trial, the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, County of Yellowstone (Montana) entered its decree of adoption, terminating the natural father's parental rights. The natural father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a divorce decree, which awarded joint custody, the natural father was ordered to pay a certain sum in monthly child support. The district court found that he had not paid the full amount of support in the first year after the divorce. In the second year, he paid no support. He also failed to maintain medical insurance for the children. After the petition for adoption was filed, he made partial payments. The district court concluded that his parental rights could be terminated without his consent and that the adoption was in the best interests of the children. The court held that the district court acted within its discretion in making its order. An adoption could be decreed without his consent upon a showing of nonsupport for a period of one year, under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-8-111(1)(a)(v). The payments of support he did make were de minimus at best. Moreover, his payments made after the petition was filed were not to be considered. Finally, the natural father failed to comply with Mont. R. App. P. 38 by filing immediate notice that he was challenging the constitutionality of the statute yet offered no reason to justify his 20-day delay in filing his notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother married the individual in 1971. Sometime in September of 1974, the mother and the putative father engaged in sexual intercourse. The minor child was born on June 21, 1975. The mother and the individual later divorced in September 1976. The state, mother, and minor child's guardian then brought an action against the putative father, under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), when the minor child was 12 years old. The district court rejected the putative father's statute of limitations claim made pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-108(1)(b); found in favor of the state, mother, and guardian; and entered a judgment that declared the putative father to be the natural father of the minor child. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the five-year statute of limitations found in &sect; 40-6-108(1)(b), was unconstitutional because it was not substantially related to an important governmental objective because recent technological advances in blood tests removed much of the fear of fraudulent claims of paternity, and courts would not be prevented under URESA from considering other issues that might arise in paternity actions once the time-bar was lifted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) sought review of the decision of respondent State Tax Appeal Board which held that the DOR's decision increasing respondent taxpayer's property taxes by 30 percent pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 15-7-111(4), 15-7-111(8) was in error and assessed the taxpayer's taxes at $ 75,000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to 1990, the taxpayer's property was appraised by the DOR at $ 28,019. In 1990, pursuant to the amendments to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-7-111, which provided that valuations should be determined by a stratified sales assessment ratio study, the DOR determined that the study showed that an adjustment factor of plus 30 percent was required, and assessed the taxpayer's property at $ 40,325. The taxpayer challenged the assessment before the board, which held that the statutory amendments were probably unconstitutional, but assessed the taxpayer taxes of $ 75,000. The DOR filed a declaratory judgment action against the board and the taxpayer. The court held that the amendments were unconstitutional because the use of the 1990 tax values derived from the ratio studies and application of the 30 percent factor to residential properties in the area in which the taxpayer resided required certain taxpayers to bear a disproportionate share of the state's tax burden. The court held that the taxpayer was entitled to an assessment of taxes based upon the 1989 valuation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the state statute providing for a stratified sales assessment ratio study in order to determine tax assessments was unconstitutional and reversed the valuation of the taxpayer's residence at $ 75,000, and directed that its valuation should be the valuation that was assessed in 1989.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney contended that the statute constituted an attempt to condition access to the practice of law upon the payment of the license fee and, therefore, impermissibly infringed upon the state supreme court's constitutional authority to supervise and regulate attorneys and the practice of law. In seeking to have the statute declared invalid, the attorney also sought modification of Mont. Sup. Ct. R. XXV(A)(6) to reflect that only the state supreme court had the authority to govern the practice of law by setting a license fee. The fact that the state supreme court had the exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law did not mean that the legislature could not, in certain limited circumstances, act in that area. The state supreme court could honor the statutory license tax &quot;as a matter of comity&quot; without surrender of its exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law.Thus, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 37-61-211, by virtue of the fact that the $ 25 license tax was a minimal and inoffensive intrusion upon the state supreme court's constitutional prerogative, was valid as a legislative enactment in aid of the power of that court to regulate the practice of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held in favor of the clerk and against the attorney and entered a declaratory judgment in favor of the clerk.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, who was defeated in the primary, and a voter who supported him, filed an action in the district court for declaratory relief.

The Attorney General filed for a writ of supervision. The court reversed the district court's order. The applicant did not come before the court as a truly independent candidate and lacked standing to challenge the statute. He was a partisan candidate who ran for re-election for the office and failed to prevail in the primary election. He made no attempt to file as an independent candidate prior to the filing date, and the laws requiring petitions and signatures for nomination as an independent candidate did not prevent him from seeking office. He chose a method of obtaining office that was permitted by law and could not complain about the operation of law that would apply to other possible candidates than himself.</SPAN></P>

A breath test registered his blood alcohol content (BAC) at .121. The court reversed defendant's negligent homicide conviction and remanded for a new trial. The trial court's instruction that a BAC greater than .10 raised a mandatory rebuttable presumption that defendant was under the influence of alcohol violated defendant's right to due process under the Fourteen Amendment. The trial court's instructions created a mandatory rebuttable presumption of intoxication. Shifting the burden of persuasion with respect to a fact that the State deemed so important that it either had to be proved or presumed violated the Due Process Clause. As soon as defendant presented his first witness to his defense that he was not intoxicated, the presumption of intoxication should have been eliminated. The instructions did not state what quantum of evidence was necessary to support a finding of its nonexistence. A reasonable juror might have believed that defendant had a duty to prove that he was not intoxicated. An unconstitutional mandatory presumption charge could not be cured by other instructions giving a correct statement of the law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that warrantless consensual electronic monitoring of face-to-face conversations by law enforcement officers while pursuing their official duties did not violate the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures nor the privacy section of the Montana Constitution. Furthermore, the court determined that &sect; 45-8-213(1)(c) provided quite clearly that a public official or employee was exempt from the privacy in communications statute so long as the recording was made in the performance of official duty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the youth was 14 years old, he was found to be in need of supervision and was committed to the custody of the Department for an evaluation. He was placed in a rehabilitation program. The trial court then ordered that he be placed in a boys school. The order was suspended and he was placed on probation. The youth then appeared before the trial court after choking his sister. The court found that he violated Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-206, he was ungovernable, and he violated the terms of his probation and committed him to the custody of the Department. On appeal, the court found that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-523 was not unconstitutionally broad on its face in giving the power to the Department to make placements of youth committed to its custody and care by a court. Section 41-5-523 was not vague because it clearly outlined the options and limitations in disposition available to a youth court and clearly placed limits on the Department in its placement and rehabilitation of youths committed to its care and custody. The youth failed to establish an equal protection violation. Nothing in the record indicated a failure of the Department to consider alternative placement.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment. The employee appealed from the judgment and the district court's award of costs to the employer for taking the employee's deposition pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-10-103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that, under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 49-2-509(7)(1987) of the Montana Human Rights Act, a proceeding before the Montana Human Rights Commission provided the employee's exclusive remedy. Sexual harassment was sexual discrimination under the Act. The harassment pre-dated the Act, but the claim was filed after the Act's effective date. The employee argued that the Act's exclusivity violated her constitutional right to contract. In affirming, the court held that recharacterizations of sexual harassment claims as certain tort claims were not permitted to bypass the Act's exclusivity and that the 1987 exclusivity clause amendment applied to all cases not settled before the time of enactment. The employee had no vested contract right to application of the laws in effect at the time of her injuries. The court concluded, however, that the district court abused its discretion by awarding the employer costs incurred in taking the employee's deposition. The deposition was unnecessary to the grant of summary judgment. Equitable tolling applied to permit the employee to file her claim with the Commission because the filing in the district court had provided the employer adequate notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sustained a work-related injury for which his employer's insurance carrier assumed liability.

In reversing and remanding, the court held that, where a workers' compensation claimant recovered against a third party, an insurer had no subrogation rights until the claimant was made whole for his entire loss and any costs of recovery, including attorney fees. In determining whether a claimant had been made whole, the amounts received and to be received under the workers' compensation claim were to be added to the amounts otherwise received or to be received from third party claims and also added to the costs of recovery. When that total equaled the claimant's entire loss, then the insurer was entitled to subrogation from all amounts received by the claimant in excess of his entire loss pursuant to Mont.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 45-5-401(1)(a), 45-5-303(1)(b) and (c), and 45-5-102(1)(b). Defendant contended that Montana lacked jurisdiction and that he was denied the right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that (1) Montana had jurisdiction under Mont.

The candidate attempted to file a declaration for nomination for one of the positions, which was rejected because the serving nominee had not been confirmed. The trial court issued a writ of mandamus directing the secretary of state to accept filings of judicial candidates, holding that Mont. Const. art VII, &sect;&sect; 7 and 8 required unconfirmed nominees to stand for election at the general election preceding the expiration of the term to which they had been nominated. On review, the court vacated the writ of mandamus, holding that under Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8(1), the nomination were not effective as appointments until after the end of the next senate session and the unconfirmed nominees were not required to stand for election until the next election that followed their confirmations. Since the confirmations would have followed the impending election, the secretary of state was not required to place the nominee's positions on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with criminal endangerment. The affidavit in support of the application for leave to file the information stated in part that defendant had appeared to be trying to hit the victim's car or to force it off the road. Defendant filed a motion to amend the charge on the ground that the offense of criminal endangerment was not intended to create an offense for conduct involving illegal or negligent operation of motor vehicles. The trial court granted the motion to amend and ruled that the amended charge should be misdemeanor assault. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the amended information on the ground that there had been no new affidavit filed to support the assault charge. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion. A trial court could use common sense and draw permissible inferences when examining an affidavit for a determination of probable cause. In this case, the trial court had found that the original affidavit clearly described all the elements necessary to charge assault, including the victim's awareness of the situation as shown by her actions in trying to avoid defendant's car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two issues dispositive of the matter were (1) whether Mont.

Const. art. II, &sect; 16 (1972). Upon review, the court answered both questions in the affirmative. The legislature improperly and unconstitutionally delegated its authority to private parties as to what terms, and under what circumstances, and in what amounts, a lump-sum conversion could have occurred. The power of the legislature to prescribe the amounts, time, and manner of payment of workers' compensation benefits, which was not doubted, was delegated to others in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-741(2). That the legislature could not do. The same reasons for invalidity that applied to &sect; 39-71-741(2) applied to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-741(1), (3). In addition, the legislation completely negated the State constitutional mandate in Mont. Const. art.

The city court also denied defendant's request for court-appointed counsel. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding that the evidence was sufficient to uphold the convictions and that defendant was properly denied counsel. The court, however, concluded that the city court punished defendant in violation of his due process and equal protection rights by setting bail that guaranteed pretrial detention and by setting a trial date for 65 days after arrest. Nevertheless, the court was unwilling to overturn defendant's convictions because defendant held the keys to his own cell. The court concluded that defendant intentionally created and prolonged the incident by his refusal to borrow $ 3. The court reversed and remanded the sentence because the district court failed to comply with Mont.

The court further found that two statutory aggravating circumstances were present. The offense was deliberate homicide committed by means of torture and the offense was also aggravated kidnapping which resulted in the death of the victim. The court stated that Montana had jurisdiction to prosecute all three charged offenses and that the findings and conclusions by the sentencing court were properly within the provisions of the statutes.

Subsequently, extensive legislation was enacted with regard to the funding of the public schools and the state and the school districts filed motions or petitions that sought clarification and modification of the court's prior opinion. The court held that an additional delay in the effective date of the prior opinion was again appropriate to allow the time necessary to implement the provisions of the newly enacted laws in order to determine whether they met the constitutional requirements of the court's prior opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State terminated the employee from his employment. Almost three years later, the employee sued the State in tort. The State moved to dismiss the suit under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-301 as untimely. The district court granted the motion, holding that &sect; 2-9-301 could constitutionally be applied to the case, even though the case arose before the enactment of the statute. The district court found that the filing requirement of the statute did not in any way alter the employee's underlying cause of action. In his pro se appeal, the court noted that the legislature could impose procedural requirements on any plaintiff, as long as substantive rights were not impaired. The employee argued that outright dismissal of the case was unfair because the statute of limitations had run on the tort claim at the time of the dismissal order. The court found that once it was determined that &sect; 2-9-301 applied, the trial court had no choice but to dismiss the suit. The court affirmed the judgment, but noted that because the employee had brought the appeal pro se, he could bring a new action for the same cause under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2-407.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It appeared, based upon evidence uncovered in the police investigation of his death, that one of the insurer's insureds might have lied on his life insurance application. The insurer sought access to the police investigation reports, so that it could better determine whether it should disclaim liability under the policy. The district court denied the application, holding that because insurance companies were not listed in the Act as entities permitted to receive confidential criminal justice information, the insurer was precluded from obtaining the requested records. In reversing, the court noted that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 44-5-303 of the Act permitted dissemination of information to those &quot;authorized by law&quot; to receive it.Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9 gave citizens a constitutional right to examine documents of state agencies. While the legislature could pass legislation protecting confidential information, it could not place unconstitutional restrictions on access, nor could it decide what the limits of the constitutional right to know were.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The justice court ruled that &sect; 62-8-401(4)(c) was unconstitutional because its statutory presumption that the person was under the influence of alcohol relieved the State from having to prove every element of a criminal case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that supervisory control was justified under Mont. R. App. P. 17 because of the State's inability to appeal the justice court's ruling and the statewide significance of the issue involved. The court noted that when interpretations of a statute could vary, courts chose a constitutional interpretation over an unconstitutional one. Consequently, for the purpose of the instant case only, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-401(4)(c) created a permissive inference that the accused was under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony assault and the district court sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The sentence was suspended in its entirety subjection to conditions. Defendant appealed from this ruling. Defendant raised the issue of whether the exclusionary rule barred admission of evidence of a person's criminal conduct which occurred in response to a U.S. Const. amend. IV violation. The court refused to extend the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence of a person's assaultive conduct towards a state employee who committed a U.S. Const. amend. IV violation. Such evidence did not constitute the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree,&quot; and thus the purpose of the exclusionary rule would not have been accomplished by its application in such a situation. The court upheld the district court's decision to deny defendant's motion to suppress evidence of his independent criminal conduct which occurred as a response to a U.S. Const. amend. IV violation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the altercation with the victim, defendant had been convicted of possession of marijuana and given a three-year deferred sentence. After receiving defendant's guilty plea to the criminal mischief charge, the district court sentenced defendant to two years in prison, but suspended the sentence and placed him on probation for two years. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's sentence. The court held that defendant did not receive a deferred sentence as did his codefendant because Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-201(6) provides that imposition of sentence in a felony case could not be deferred in the case of a defendant who was convicted of a felony on a prior occasion whether or not the sentence was imposed, deferred, or suspended. The court held that defendant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 46-18-201(6) was violative of Mont. Const. article II, &sect; 17, which provides that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. The court held that defendant's argument attacking the constitutionality of &sect; 46-18-201(6) was moot because the challenged amendment was stricken and became ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Human Rights Commission argued that the appeal should be dismissed because it was moot contending that all the relief requested except punitive damages could have been obtained following receipt of the right-to-sue letter issued to the former employee. However, because the constitutional questions raised were capable of repetition, yet could evade review, the court determined that the issues were not moot. The court found that the Act was not unconstitutional because of its preclusion of punitive damages. The court also found that the provision of an administrative hearing as opposed to a right to a jury trial in court contingent upon the issuance of a right-to-sue letter did not render the Act unconstitutional. The court, however, tolled the statute of limitations, which began to run after the issuance of the right-to-sue letter, pending its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stockgrowers brought a suit seeking a declaration that the classification of livestock separate from business inventory was invalid. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision granting judgment for the stockgrowers. The court held that there was a distinction that justified the classification of livestock separate from business inventory. Mont. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1 gave the stockgrowers a constitutionally significant interest in tax classifications. However, the power to exempt particular classes of properties was specifically enumerated under Mont. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 5, therefore the proper test for the classification at issue was the rational basis test. The court held that there was some ground of difference that rationally explained the different treatment. The DOR demonstrated conceivable bases for different treatment. For example, breeding stock was not property held for sale, but property held to produce products for sale. Furthermore, the legislature historically distinguished between livestock and stocks of merchandise of all sorts. The trial court erred in holding that livestock constituted business inventory under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-6-202(5).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former employee claimed damages for wrongful termination from employment, and other common law claims. Petitioner also sought punitive damages. Respondent former employer moved to dismiss petitioner's cause of action asserting that the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (Act), Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2-901 to 39-2-914, precluded petitioner's common-law claims. Petitioner responded to the motion contending that the Act violated Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 and the federal district court certified related questions to the court. First, the court found that the Act did not violate the fundamental right of full legal redress because no such fundamental right was created by Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. Specifically, the court held that petitioner was not deprived of a fundamental right because no one had a vested right to a rule of common law. The court also determined that the Act's limitations on damages were valid because such limitations were rationally related to a legitimate state interest; the legislature had the plenary power to determine the availability of punitive damages in relationship to promoting Montana's economic interests.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, court determined that limitations on recovery of punitive damages were also not a denial of full legal redress because it served a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

The court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion by reducing the attorney's hourly rate where the attorney did not charge a customary and current hourly rate and there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's findings. The court found that the attorney who charged contingency could not reap the same benefits from hourly rates as he could from successful contingent fee cases. The court noted that an attorney who charged a customary and current hourly fee did not take the same risk nor expect the same high compensation in return. The court determined that the trial court did not error by awarding the claimant attorney fees only for those issues upon which the claimant prevailed. The court concluded that under Mont.

Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-111, in the employee's wrongful discharge action that alleged that the employer's requirement that she empty 55-gallon containers created an unsafe work place and violated a city ordinance prohibiting the containers' use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a custodian, the employee was ordered to empty the 55-gallon trash drums into a dumpster and her request for a change in her duties so that she would not have to empty them was denied. On appeal, she argued that the act of terminating her was an administrative action, not a legislative action, and &sect; 2-9-111's immunity was inapplicable. Further, she argued that granting the employer immunity violated her fundamental right to full legal redress provided in Mont. Const. 1972 art. II, &sect; 16. Finding that the employer was immune from suit as a matter of law, the court held that the express language of &sect; 2-9-11, granting immunity to a governmental entity for an act or omission of its legislative body, applied the immunity to school districts, school boards, and their members, officers, or agents when they were in the lawful discharge of an official duty, such as hiring or firing. Further, the Montana constitution's provision for court access involved a non-fundamental right and thus the constitutionality of &sect; 2-9-111 was presumed, only a rational relationship to a legitimate right was involved, and the State had already passed that rational relationship test as to &sect; 2-9-111.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant had been suffering from asthma before he began working for the employer. Due to abnormally dense fumes at his job as a welder, the claimant suffered a serious attack of asthma that left him hospitalized for four days. The workers' compensation court found that the claimant's occupational disease was nondisabling and the unexpected occurrence of abnormally dense fumes at work caused an aggravation of the claimant's preexisting asthma condition, and therefore qualified as an injury. However, the workers' compensation court also concluded that that the injury was noncompensable under the Workers' Compensation Act because the Act distinguished an employee who suffered from an occupational disease from an employee who suffered an injury. The claimant argued the Occupational Disease Act was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. It stated that the claimant had failed to show that the legislature was required to award the same or comparable benefits under the Occupational Disease Act as compared to the Workers' Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Gallatin County, Eighteenth Judicial District (Montana), which dismissed an indictment against defendant charging him with driving under the influence in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-401, and operating a snowmobile on a city street in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2-631.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for riding a snowmobile while drunk. The court upheld the trial court's dismissal of the &sect; 61-8-401 charge because. A snowmobile was a vehicle as defined in &sect; 61-1-103. Yet, snowmobiles were not defined in Title 61, Chapter 8, part 1, although other types of vehicles were specifically defined therein. Title 23, Chapter 2, part 6, provided statutory regulation for the operation of snowmobiles on public streets and highways. Thus, the legislature provided a statutory scheme that supplanted the motor vehicle code regarding snowmobiles, meaning that snowmobiles were not subject to the restrictions placed on motor vehicles. The court rejected the state's contention that &sect; 61-8-401 provided for criminal sanctions while Title 23, Chapter 2, part 6, provided for civil sanctions, allowing both to be imposed for the same occurrence. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2-642(2), (3) imposed fines for violation of laws and therefore constituted a criminal penalty. The trial court erred in dismissing the &sect; 23-2-631 charge, but that contention was not before the court.</SPAN></P>

It held that the owners enjoyed a beneficial use interest in the 500 KV lines, which use was properly taxable under &sect; 15-24-1203. The use was evidenced by the owners' contractual reservation of firm transmission demands in the lines and the fact the lines were constructed for the purpose of transmitting the owners' electrical power generated at certain generating facilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrowers claimed that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-17-203(2) violated the due process guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mont. Const. art.

Code Ann. &sect; 27-17-101 et seq., were constitutional. The court explained that the terms of the borrowers' installment contract gave the lender the right to repossess the trailer when the borrowers defaulted, and that the borrowers were notified by the lender that the trailer would be repossessed. The court noted that the claim and delivery statutes required a finding that the delay caused by a hearing would seriously impair the lender's remedy and provided that the lender had to file a bond in order to protect the borrowers. The court also noted that the borrowers had the right to immediately apply for a motion to quash the seizure order, and that Mont. R.

The court affirmed the order that transferred the case to district court. The court held that there was no due process violation because &sect; 41-5-206(3) did not dictate the outcome of any hearing because the youths that fell under that provision were not granted an initial hearing. The statute was presumed constitutional, and defendant failed to demonstrate its invalidity. There was no denial of equal protection. Age was not a suspect classification, and the court, applying a rational basis test, held that &sect; 41-5-206(3) was rationally related to the legitimate state objective of curbing homicides committed by teenagers and protecting society from such violent offenders.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1983, defendant was charged with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent against his stepdaughter. As part of his plea agreement defendant was evaluated by a psychologist to determine whether he was amenable to treatment.

This information was transmitted to the county attorney who then increased the sentence recommendation from three to seven years. Defendant accepted the plea. Defendant was later charged with more counts of sexual intercourse without consent, including some of the exact instances that were part of his plea agreement. The court held the state was barred from prosecuting the first 24 because those offenses were included in the scope of the 1984 plea agreement. Defendant sacrificed his right to remain silent in speaking with the psychologist and was punished for admitting his additional crimes. He could not be punished for them again. The court affirmed the remaining two counts, rejecting defendant's contention that Mont.

The court held that the Act was constitutional and that respondents' expenditures of trust funds were authorized under the Act. The plain language of art. IX, &sect; 2 did not place a limitation upon the appropriation of resource indemnity trust funds beyond a restriction that protected the principal of the trust from loss or diversion. The Act provided that trust funds were to be used to improve the total environment and rectify damage thereto. The appropriation or allocation of trust funds was not limited to the reclamation of lands disturbed by the taking of natural resources. The use of trust funds for programs related to improving the total environment did not constitute an expenditure for general operating expenses of state agencies in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-38-203(2) and did not violate respondents' fiduciary duty to the trust.</SPAN></P>

The questions involved were whether the decision by the Department to place the minor in a facility was a violation of the Separation of Powers Clause, Mont. Const. art.

The court held that there was no constitutional violation by giving the Department the authority to place the child. The decision to commit the youth was made by the youth court and it then handed the placement duties over to the Department. The court opined that the minor had no absolute right to counsel at the placement hearing.

The court explained that constitutional rights were not always absolute; rather, there were just constitutional safeguards that had to have been met before a government could infringe on an individual's rights. The court noted that the right to travel did not encompass the unrestrained use of the highway and did not include the ability to ignore laws governing the use of public roadways.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to the fact that the State intended to introduce other acts of defendant involving sex with his daughter, he sought an order permitting him to be present when his counsel interviewed the victim.

On review, the State claimed that the confrontation clause did not require defendant's presence at the interview, and other less intrusive methods could be fashioned that would allow defendant to adequately prepare his defense. The court agreed and reversed the order. The court reasoned that the confrontation clause only permitted an opportunity for cross-examination, not to an extent the defense felt necessary. Defendant had not demonstrated a substantial need for a face to face interview, given the psychological damage that could occur to the victim.

From a judgment of the District Court for the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County (Montana) dismissing his pro se complaint with prejudice, plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While awaiting sentencing following his robbery conviction, plaintiff filed a civil action, claiming that there had been insufficient grounds for his arrest, an unconstitutional line-up, and an inadequate investigation of the crime with which he was charged. In dismissing the complaint on its own motion, the trial court stated that, on its face, the complaint was frivolous and failed to state any cognizable cause of action. The court took judicial notice of the appellate record concerning plaintiff's robbery conviction. As to the county commissioners, dismissal with prejudice was proper because the complaint did not allege any connection between the county commissioners and the police action that was claimed to have deprived plaintiff of his rights. Because plaintiff's complaint, broadly viewed, stated a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for violation of civil rights, his claims against the remaining defendants could be barred under a theory of collateral estoppel as a result of the decision in the criminal proceeding against him.

The court held that the employee's contract rights were set by the workers' compensation laws in effect at the time of the injury and that applying the amendments to him impaired his contractual right to directly petition the workers' compensation court, in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 31. The court explained that the delay caused by mandatory mediation substantially impaired the employee's rights and that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the amendments, when applied retroactively, achieved their purpose of reducing court cases.</SPAN></P>

The compensation court upheld the offset, finding that &sect; 39-71-702(2) was clear and unambiguous on its face. The worker's motion for a new trial was denied, and the worker appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the offset statute was clear, unambiguous, and consistent with the legislative intent to prevent duplication of disability pay. The court held that that the language in &sect; 39-71-702(2), &quot;payable because of the injury,&quot; was not an authorization for the exemption of a part of the worker's federal disability from the state setoff. The court also found that the compensation court's interpretation of &sect; 39-71-702(2) was not an unconstitutional violation of the Supremacy Clause because it did not prohibit the worker from electing to take federal disability pay nor did it preclude him from receiving that pay to which he was entitled under the federal act.</SPAN></P>

The protesters contended that the ballot title and statements of implication which would appear on the ballot were untrue, misleading and unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment because the neither ballot title, language, or the abbreviated form were legally deficient. The court noted that the ballot title had remained unchanged during the legislative process. The title complied with a constitutional requirement that it clearly express the subject in the title and with the rules of statutory construction developed under case law. The court held that the trial court correctly recognized the inability and the inappropriateness of removing the legislative referendum from the ballot, because there was no statutory authority for a pre-election nullification of a referendum.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered the record owner, who was a federal prisoner, to deposit a sum into court. He did not do so. The trial court then found that under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-18-402(1) (1985), because the record owner had not made the deposit, he was deemed to have waived any defects in the tax proceedings and any right of redemption. The court stated that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-18-401 required the record owner or &quot;true owner&quot; of property to deposit into court sums paid by purchasers to preserve the property or to make improvements thereon after three years from the date of the tax sale. The statute, however, had been interpreted to mean that the only amount a purchaser might lawfully demand to be deposited into court was that amount that he would be entitled to receive in the event the tax deed was set aside. Here, some of the items claimed by the purchasers, such as advertising and mailing costs, were demonstrably not sums covered by &sect; 15-18-401. The court declined to reach the question of the constitutionality of the deposit requirement. If on remand a deposit was not made because of indigency, the question of constitutionality could be raised before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment regarding the admission of the objected-to evidence, finding that medical records from other physicians were admissible because the treating physician had used them in his diagnosis and treatment of the motorcyclist.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contested the conviction resulting from his third trial by raising issues of speedy trial, due process, venue, sentencing, and the denial of a motion for new trial. The court affirmed the conviction. The court concluded that defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial considering the complexity of the pre-trial issues, the institutional nature of the State's delay, the existence of transcripts from previous trials to mitigate the prejudice to defendant, and defendant's release between trials. The court found that the addition of witnesses, changes in witnesses' testimony, and prosecution of a defense witness before trial were proper or within the discretion of the trial court and did not prejudice defendant. The court determined that the venue of the trial with witnesses from a different county did not result in an unfair trial. Because the alleged new evidence was cumulative or tending only to impeach, the court agreed that there was no basis for a new trial. Because a different trial judge imposed the higher sentence on defendant, the court found that there was no presumption of or actual vindictiveness in the sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death for each homicide and for each aggravated kidnapping which resulted in the victim's death.

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant consented to the initial entry and exigent circumstances justified a warrantless limited search of the room. The court held that the reference to defendant's silence was admissible because it was in response to the defense that was presented at trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Montana certified, under Mont. R. App. P. 44, the following question: Where a general contractor is compelled, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-405(1), to pay workers' compensation benefits to an employee of an uninsured subcontractor, is that general contractor's liability limited, by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-411, to compensation under the Workers' Compensation Act?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant general contractor was hired by a school district to remove an existing building and construct a new school building. Defendant subcontractor worked on the project. Plaintiff employee worked for the subcontractor, and he was injured in an accident that arose out of and in the course of his employment. The subcontractor failed to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage for the employee as required by state law. The general contractor's workers' compensation insurance carrier therefore became liable for payment of benefits to the employee. When the employee filed suit against the general contractor and the subcontractor, the general contractor claimed that it was entitled to the insulation provided employers under the Workers' Compensation Act. At issue was whether the employee could maintain an action for negligence against the general contractor under the circumstances. The court held that the employee could maintain such an action, and therefore answered the certified question in the negative. Under relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, the general contractor was not an immunized employer because it was not the employee's immediate employer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act pledged the credit of the state to secure bonds issued by the technology board, the proceeds of which would be used for the benefit of private businesses, in violation of Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant left the public highway upon which he was travelling and drove on a dirt road that ran into the victim's property to investigate structures that he thought looked like beehives. A gate where the road met the highway had been left open. After defendant satisfied his curiosity, he began to leave and was stopped by the victim who phoned the sheriff. There was a 12 x 5 inch sign to the right of the opening that was painted fluorescent orange; however, there was no written message on the sign. Although both parties agreed that defendant had no knowledge that the post marking constituted legal notice of no trespassing under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-6-201(2), the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. In Montana it was not necessary for one to form the intent to commit a specific crime or to intend the result that occurred to be found guilty of knowingly committing a crime. Further, ignorance of the law was not a defense. Finally, the legislature did not intend to deprive a property owner of his right to allow or refuse entry to whomever he wanted. Because the gate through which defendant entered was adorned with the proper markings, defendant was denied the right to enter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dissolution order dissolving the marriage of the father and the mother provided for joint custody of the child with primary physical custody with the mother and ordered the father to pay monthly child support. On review, the court held that clear and convincing evidence supported the district court's finding that the father was able to contribute to the child's support but did not do so for over a year and thus that his consent to the adoption was not necessary under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-8-111(1)(a)(v). However, the district court erred in concluding that the adoption of the child by the new husband and the termination of the father's parental rights was in the best interest of the child because, after a determination was made under &sect; 40-8-111(1)(a)(v) that a father's consent to the adoption was not necessary, the remaining issue was whether the adoption by the petitioning party was in the best interests of the child. The father failed to establish all the elements necessary to grant a motion for a new trial based on surprise testimony and the absence of answer briefs to his several post-motions did not compel the district court to grant the motions.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the defendant's reliance on Mont.

The court also held that the warrantless consensual electronic monitoring of face-to-face conversations by use of a body-wire transmitting device did not violate the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures nor the privacy section of the Montana Constitution.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, counties and an assessor, appealed an order of the District Court of Lewis and Clark County, First Judicial District (Montana), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant State, dismissing the action by the counties and holding that the provision of General Appropriations Bill 500 that funded only 70 percent of the salaries for county assessors did not violate Mont. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">General Appropriations Bill 500 provided state funding for the salaries for county assessors for fiscal year 1987 at the level of 70 percent. The remaining 30 percent was to be paid by the counties. The counties challenged the apportionment and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the State. The counties appealed. In affirming, the court found that the dispositive question was whether the imposition by the Montana Constitution on the State of the duty to appraise, assess, and equalize property valuations mandated that the State should fully fund the county assessors' salaries. It was apparent that Mont. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 was adopted with a conscious choice of leaving the method of implementing the State's duties to the legislature. Even though Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-8-101 required the Department of Revenue to secure such personnel as was necessary to properly perform its duties, that section did not dictate, when read with other statutes, that the State should completely fund county assessor salaries. Mont. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 gave the legislature wide flexibility to implement the assessment, appraisal, and valuation of property for tax purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the preliminary hearing four days after defendant's arrest, defendant invoked his statutory right to close the proceedings to the press and public pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-10-201, which was granted. The press then commenced a series of legal proceedings, which delayed the preliminary examination for approximately five months and the trial was scheduled two months after the preliminary hearing. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that his right to a speedy trial was violated. In affirming, the court held that the State's burden was not met to rebut the presumption of prejudice. The State claimed the delay was &quot;institutional&quot; and therefore not chargeable to the State. However, the institutional delay was caused by the lawsuit filed by the press, and the State's inaction in the face of that suit. Further, the State failed to demonstrate that defendant's incarceration was not oppressive. Thus, the court had no alternative than to determine that there was excessive delay on the part of the prosecution with no justification.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-303 and for deliberate homicide under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-102(1) entered by the District Court of Lake County, Twentieth Judicial District (Montana).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant robbed a pharmacy, the police followed him to another store where he took a minor as his hostage by pointing a pistol at his head. While in the store, defendant fired a shot at the clerk, missing her. Defendant left the store with his hostage. When the police stopped him at a roadblock, defendant demanded an airplane and a pilot in exchange for his hostage. As such, the police provided him with a plane and a pilot. After the pilot boarded the plane, defendant released his hostage and boarded the plane. While the pilot was attempting to start the plane, officers shot defendant. Subsequently, defendant shot the pilot, resulting in the pilot's death. Defendant pled guilty to deliberate homicide, aggravated assault, and aggravated kidnapping. The court held that there was no violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII when the trial court referred to the victim impact information during sentencing and that the death penalty for aggravated kidnapping was proper. However, the court held that the death penalty for deliberate homicide was improper because the trial court improperly found the existence of an aggravating circumstance under Mont.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the death sentence for the deliberate homicide charge only. In all other respects, including the death sentence for aggravated kidnapping, the court affirmed the sentence.

In response to such an advisement, relator filed an application for a declaratory judgment praying that the court issue an alternative writ of mandate requiring the Secretary to commence the administrative process for inclusion of the very same ballot measures in the next regular statewide election. The Attorney General filed a written response to the court, concluding that the parties were not adverse and that the case took the posture of a &quot;friendly&quot; action. The court found that there was no justiciable controversy presented by relator's application for a writ of mandate because an applicant for a writ of mandate was required to establish a clear legal right to the writ and a violation of the duty by the person sought to have been coerced. Because the Secretary was performing the duty for which relator was seeking the writ of mandate for, the court refused jurisdiction over relator's application and proposed complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State of Montana, chiefly its Attorney General, challenged an order of the District Court of the Tenth Judicial District, Fergus County (Montana), which granted a preliminary injunction to plaintiffs, Lewistown Montana Law Enforcement Academy Committee and others, restraining the State from purchasing or leasing modular buildings or facilities being used by the Montana Law Enforcement Academy in Gallatin County, Montana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Committee claimed that a lease and option agreement entered into between the Attorney General and the owners of the property housing the Academy was governed by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 18-3-101 et seq. The court noted that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 44-10-202 specifically gave the Attorney General the power to choose the site for the Academy and to do all things for the establishment and operation of the Academy that were consistent with State statutes. In the court's view, the specific authority given to the Attorney General in &sect; 44-10-202 prevailed over the limitations placed upon lease-option contracts contained in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 18-3-101 et seq. However, the net effect of an 1985 amendment of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 44-10-202 required the Attorney General to obtain the approval of the Montana Department of Administration before leasing, renting, or purchasing property under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-17-101(1). The court opined that the 1987 General Appropriations Act, which authorized the Attorney General to purchase the facilities for the Academy, conflicted with &sect; 2-17-101. However, because the Appropriations Act was more specific and was on an equal footing with &sect; 2-17-101, the Act controlled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee social services agency filed action against appellant Director of Social and Rehabilitation Services, contending that Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 53-3-205(3), and 209(2) violated the equal protection rights of persons in need of state assistance on the basis of whether or not such persons had dependent children. The statutes were promulgated under the state obligation under Mont. Const. art. XII, &sect; 3(3) to provide assistance. The trial court found that the constitutional provision required that all persons in need of state assistance must be treated equally and not distinguished as a class by whether or not they had dependent children. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that the distinction based solely on the presence or nonpresence of dependent minor children, without regard to whether able-bodied persons without dependent minor children might have had need for the aid of society did not meet the duty imposed on the legislature to provide for persons under art. XII, &sect; 3(3). The court reasoned that persons with or without dependent children could have similar or different needs, and that class distinctions were not reasonable and did not pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of felony assault and one count of witness tampering. Defendant appealed. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court did not err. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State's motion in limine to exclude the testimony of defendant's expert witness where defendant was not prevented from presenting adequate evidence for his intoxication defense. The court held that defendant's charges were properly joined for trial where it promoted judicial economy and where defendant failed to establish he was prejudiced because of the joinder. As to the trial court's jury instructions, the court determined they were properly stated under the law and that defendant's proposed instructions would have been repetitive. The court concluded that defendant was properly designated as a dangerous offender because there was substantial support for it in defendant's history and defendant's unsupported testimony was not enough to overcome it.</SPAN></P>

The claimant's petition for a rehearing was denied because the constitutional issue raised for rehearing was not raised earlier. The issues on review were whether the claimant could raise the issue of constitutional equal protection violation at the appeal level and whether Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The finance company agreed to construct and lease a vehicle storage building for the use of the City.

The agreement also provided that, if the City did not renew the lease, it would pay liquidated damages to the finance company. The finance company brought the action to compel the City to pay the taxes. The trial court found the finance company was responsible for taxes and awarded attorney fees to the City. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the agreement was not really a lease with an option to buy because the liquidated damages clause essentially obligated the City to purchase the property. The court analogized the agreement to retail installment contracts under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 31-1-202(1). The court emphasized that the City was not yet the owner of the building because the title had not yet been delivered to the City. The court found that attorney fees were properly awarded because of the reciprocal attorney fee statute in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 28-3-704.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff husband was a member of a religious group. The husband forgave his prior wife for an act of adultery before learning that she had also committed other acts of adultery. The religious group's doctrine provided that forgiveness of an act of adultery forgave all prior acts of adultery whether known or unknown. The doctrine also provided that a member was scripturally free to remarry only if his spouse committed adultery and was not forgiven. A member who remarried but was not scripturally free to do so could be expelled from the religious group. The husband divorced his prior wife and remarried another. Plaintiffs, the husband and his new wife, were disfellowshipped from the religious group. After the congregation was told that plaintiffs were disfellowshipped for conduct unbecoming Christians, plaintiffs filed the instant suit. The trial court entered summary judgment for defendants. The appellate court affirmed, holding that defendants' statements were privileged and that it was not within the court's power to question the religious group's determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from the District Court of Gallatin County, Eighteenth Judicial District (Montana), order dismissing their malicious prosecution and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims against defendant Gallatin County for failure to state a claim. The dispositive issue was whether the County was a proper defendant, conceding the immunity of the County Attorney himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case arose from a criminal prosecution which had charged plaintiffs with common scheme theft in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-6-301(2)(a). Plaintiffs purportedly contracted to build garages for property owners in the County and then failed to pay the materialmen for materials used in the construction. The County dismissed the complaint about two months after the charges were brought. Plaintiffs then sued the County, arguing it was liable for the action of the County Attorney. The district court dismissed the entire second amended complaint, concluding the County was not the proper entity for either of plaintiffs' two counts. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the district court ignored the distinction between personal capacity suits and official capacity suits. The court affirmed, extending a prior holding on prosecutorial immunity to counties. The court found that the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity must encompass the state and its agencies as well as the prosecutor or its efficacy would be lost. It was unnecessary to decide whether the County Attorney in his prosecutorial capacity was an agent of the County or the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing plaintiff's malicious prosecution complaint was affirmed. A prior holding was extended to include prosecutorial immunity for counties, as there were strong policy reasons for absolute prosecutorial immunity for governmental entities as well as for personal immunity of the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that defendant's bail was reasonable because it insured his presence at future proceedings, and that indictment by information was acceptable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested he refused to take a breath test but requested an independent blood test at his own expense. His request was refused. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss based on the refusal claiming that his due process rights were violated. On appeal, the court held that the rule in State v. Swanson did allow one accused of a crime involving intoxication to obtain an independent blood test in order to establish sobriety regardless of whether he submitted to the police designated test. Furthermore, the court held that the rule could be applied retroactively and thus applied to defendant. The decision in Swanson did establish a new principle of law by overruling established precedent on which the litigants relied, denying defendant the right to obtain a blood test. In addition, the interference with defendant's right to obtain exculpatory evidence was the type of denial of due process against which the Swanson rule was designed to protect. Finally, no substantial inequity would result from the retroactive application of the rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurance commissioner appealed an order of the District Court of Lewis and Clark County (Montana), directing her to provide respondent editor with access to data and analyses in her possession that related to insurance companies. The trial court held that a corporation, such as insurance companies, could not assert a right to privacy exemption under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9 and that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 33-1-412(5) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance commissioner asserted that &sect; 33-1-412(5) gave her the right to withhold information where the release of the information could cause unwarranted injury to the insurance companies. She argued that the reports they filed contained matters of individual privacy and investigative information, which were not a matter of public record. On appeal, the court reversed the order directing her to release the information and remanded the case. The demands of individual privacy of a corporation could exceed the merits of public disclosure, and came within the privacy exception of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. The insurance commissioner had the right to assert the privacy rights of the insurance companies because it could be sued for the release of injurious information. The court found that &sect; 33-1-412(5) was identical to, and coextensive with, the right to privacy exception to the state constitution. The statutory language was simply an alternate expression of the constitutional privacy exception. The insurance companies had a subjection expectation of privacy in their reports that were given to the state for regulatory purposes and their expectations of privacy were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and found the statute constitutional as applied. The court remanded the case for entry of judgment in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The officer was a Texas resident and had no contact with Montana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sued the officer in Texas and Montana for recovery of the funds, which had been deposited in a Montana bank, or injunction conserving the deposited funds pending the action.

The court held that the relationship among defendant, the forum, and the litigation met the test of minimum contacts so as not to offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The court held that the test was met because there was a positive nexus between the officer, who caused the funds to be deposited in his name in Montana, the forum, where the deposits were located, and the litigation, which concerned ownership of the deposits. The court found that the trial court's judgment supported traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice by effectively making the bank a stakeholder of the deposited funds biding the determination of the controversy in the Texas courts. The court held that the officer could have no objection to the resolution of the underlying controversy in his home state.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also refused to declare Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 82-4-224&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 82-4-224 stated that the owner of the land had to consent to strip-mining. The energy company argued that to require further consent after having signed the lease was an unlawful taking. Prior litigation had determined that strip-mining was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the deeds were conveyed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that &sect; 82-4-224 was unconstitutional because it constituted a taking. The court held that the holder of an unexpired leasehold was entitled to compensation and in this case, what made the right to mine coal valuable was that it could be exercised with profit. To make it commercially impracticable to mine certain coal has very nearly the same effect for constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it. The court held finally, that &sect; 82-4-224 interfered with the obligations of the contract entered as between the original parties and therefore the statute had no substantial relation to the general welfare and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant State of Montana Secretary of State filed a petition for clarification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its original opinion, the court voided an initiative amendment to Mont. Const. of 1972 art.

The court provided in its original opinion that Mont. Const. of 1972 art. XIV, &sect; 9 required the printing of the full text of a proposed initiative amendment in the media. The Attorney General argued that such publication was not required. The Attorney General and the Secretary sought an order, requiring a new election under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-35-107. The coalition argued that the court overturned the amendment on a slight procedural irregularity. The court found that none of the petitions met the requirements of Mont. R. App. P. 34. However, the court discussed the issues and held that Montana's 1972 Constitutional Convention did not change the publishing requirements of an initiative and noted that the text of the proposed initiative in the voter information pamphlet was extremely different from the text certified by the Secretary. The court also held that a new election under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-35-107 was discretionary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A closely held corporation executed a buy-sell agreement pursuant to which the stockholders agreed not to dispose of the stock without written consent of the remaining stockholders and of the corporation. A shareholder who desired to sell his stock requested that the corporation appoint an independent appraiser. The other shareholders withheld their consent to the sale and voted not to appoint an appraiser. The trial court dismissed the shareholder's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the corporation to appoint an appraiser as a prerequisite to the sale of his stock. The court affirmed. The restrictions under the agreement satisfied the statutory requirements of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-617. The agreement did not permanently prohibit the sale of stock because the requirement of written consent was in effect only as long as the initial stockholders were alive. All five stockholders had freely executed the agreement. Although Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 35-1-617 was enacted after the agreement was executed, the statute demonstrated legislative approval of the action taken by the shareholders. The statute thus could be applied to the agreement without a question of improper retroactivity.</SPAN></P>

The dispositive issue on appeal was whether the trial court correctly ruled that the taxpayer had to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to initiating suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer conceded that he did not appeal his 1985 property tax appraisal to the appropriate administrative boards. He argued that because he exhausted his administrative remedies for four prior years and because he attacked the 1985 tax assessment on the same grounds, he had, in effect, exhausted his administrative remedies for 1985. On appeal, the court pointed out that the rule still applied that where a right of action and the conditions for bringing the action were contained within the same statute, compliance with the conditions was a condition precedent, which had to be fulfilled to preserve the right. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-402 allowed a taxpayer to file a suit to recover taxes paid under protest after the taxpayer had exhausted administrative appeals. The taxpayer did not comply with the statutory conditions for bringing suit; the motion to dismiss was properly granted. The complaint did allege that the method of assessment was discriminatory, illegal, and unconstitutional; but the principal thrust of the complaint was aimed at the amount and not the method of valuation. In such a case, the complaint did not come within the exception to the exhaustion of remedies rule.</SPAN></P>

The trial court judge did not abuse his discretion when he denied defendant's request to close the voir dire of the jury panel, given that the judge had a plan to question individual veniremen in chambers if the need arose. Although the manner in which voir dire was conducted was improper and not to be condoned, the error was harmless given that defendant's own testimony was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The felony homicide statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-102(1)(b), was constitutional because the State was not relieved of the burden of proving an element of the crime. Instead the method of proving one of the elements, intent, had been changed so that the State could substitute proof of the mental state necessary to commit a homicide with proof of the mental state required to commit the underlying felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mont. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-2-302(2)(d), (e), (f) provided for a public right on beds and banks of waters to build duck blinds, boat moorages, and to camp overnight under certain conditions. Mont. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23-2-311(3)(e) required landowners to bear the cost of constructing portage routes around artificial barriers. The landowners sought to have Mont. Stat. &sect; 23-2-301 et seq. declared unconstitutional. The district court granted summary judgment for the state. On appeal, the landowners argued that the statutes went beyond the scope of the public trust doctrine. The court reversed and held that: (1) the public had a right to use the waters up to the high water mark, but use of the bed and banks had to be of minimal impact; (2) the overnight camping, mooring, and duck blind provisions were overbroad, as they were not necessary for utilization of the water resource itself; (3) big game hunting was not permitted, as it was not a necessary part of the easement granted to the public for its enjoyment of the water; and (4) while the user had a right to portage around obstructions minimally impacting the adjoining landowner's fee interest, the landowner was not required to bear the cost.</SPAN></P>

The evidence demonstrated that the father was &quot;able&quot; to pay the ordered child support; thus, he had to face the consequences of his failure to do so. The court refused to address the constitutionality of &sect; 40-8-111(1)(a)(v) because the father failed to notify the Montana Attorney General of the constitutional challenge as required by Mont. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was found to be permanently totally disabled and entitled to bi-weekly benefits and a partial lump-sum payment. The claimant was awarded only a small portion of the lump-sum advance he had requested. Mont.

The claimant challenged the constitutionality of the application of the amended statute to his case. On appeal, the court noted that the standing of parties to bring their claims was a threshold question that had to addressed before the substantive issues of a case. If the claimant was not entitled to a lump-sum at all, then he could not challenge the constitutionality of the methodology of computation. Therefore, because the trial court failed to find that the claimant's best interests would have been met by conversion of his biweekly benefits to a lump-sum payment, the claimant lacked standing to contest the constitutionality of Senate Bill 281 and &sect; 39-71-741.</SPAN></P>

The court found that as a taxpayer, property owner, and elector the taxpayer had standing to bring suit. The court found that the taxpayer had recourse through the process for objection set for in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-27-316(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant questioned whether the retroactive application of the incest statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-507, voided his conviction and whether double jeopardy barred his retrial on a charge of sexual assault. The court reversed defendant's conviction with instructions to dismiss, finding that as applied to defendant the state's retroactive enforcement of the amended incest statute violated Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 31. The court found nothing in the amended incest statute that permitted retroactive application. The court concluded that the imposition of a sentence for a conviction under statutes not in force at the time the offense was committed was an ex post facto application of the law and, therefore, unconstitutional. Further, the court determined that defendant's incestuous conduct constituted the same offense in law and in fact as sexual assault and, therefore, the double jeopardy clause prohibited defendant's retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's action against the hospital and doctor arose out of involuntary commitment proceedings initiated by the patient's family and the county attorney after the patient threatened to commit suicide. At the commitment proceeding, the patient was released by the trial court to the care of a friend. A court-appointed a psychologist later found that the patient was no longer suicidal. The county attorney's office decided to dismiss the petition for involuntary commitment. The patient brought the action seeking damages for alleged violations of Montana's mental health code. She also sought recovery on the basis of the common law theories of assault, battery, and false imprisonment. The court granted respondents' motions for summary judgment, finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact to preclude the order of summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that an emergency situation clearly existed in the case, and the trial court did not err in supporting the doctor's conclusion that the patient was seriously mentally ill and was a threat to her own life. The requirements of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-21-129(2) were substantially met.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 13-1-111(1)(c), which denied them voting rights in state elections, was unconstitutional but upholding income taxes assessed against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents lived in an area that was not part of any county. Section 13-1-111(1)(c) required that voters reside in a county 30 days prior to an election in order to vote. The court found that the trial court was correct in its determination that the law was unconstitutional as applied to the residents. The court refused to hear the residents' equal protection claims that they were denied access to hunting and fishing licenses and other state privileges, holding that they did not have standing. They did not show that they had in fact been injured by the laws. The legislature did not have to take some formal action to accept retrocession of taxing jurisdiction by the federal government before an income tax could be lawfully assessed on the residents. The court rejected the residents' argument that the state could not tax their incomes until it also bestowed upon them every benefit enjoyed by those who resided within a county. The tax levied on the residents' income was constitutional and did not deprive them of equal protection of the laws. The denial of certain benefits alleged by residents was not a sufficient reason to prevent the state from levying an income tax upon them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents objected to the rule adopted by respondents requiring a student to maintain a 2.0 grade average for the preceding nine weeks in order to participate in extracurricular activities in the following nine week grading period. The rule did not apply to special education students or students with learning disabilities. The trial court found the 2.0 rule to be a reasonable, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory policy, promulgated for the purpose of implementing the constitutional and statutory mandated educational goals of the school district. On appeal, parents contended that the right to participate in extracurricular activities was fundamental and that the strict scrutiny standard of review applied. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the right to existing extracurricular activities was not a fundamental right under the state's constitution. The competing interests had to be balanced by applying a middle-tier constitutional analysis for equal protection purposes. The state's interest in making this classification based upon academic grades was more important than the students' interest in participating in existing extracurricular activities.</SPAN></P>

After their request for permission to record the upcoming hearing was denied the parents applied to the district court for relief. When the district court, concluding that the denial violated the parents' due process rights, ordered that the panel allow an unofficial transcript to be made, appellants sought review. On appeal the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court rejected the parents' argument that the panel's rules were inconsistent with the transcript provisions of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), noting that the panel's enabling legislation, which required that no official transcript be made, was clear evidence of the legislature's intent that MAPA not apply to the panel. Nor was the court persuaded that the panel's rules offended due process, noting that they were reasonably calculated to maintain the hearing's confidentiality. The court rejected the parents' contention that the denial of the transcript would destroy their right to fully cross-examine witnesses at trial, noting that while a transcript would certainly have been helpful, it was not essential for them to exercise that right.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 71-3-1201 et seq., and ordered the return of their remaining horsesafter the posting of a bond.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners pastured their horses with the agister. A dispute arose as to whether the agister was also responsible for feeding the horses. The agister sent them notice of an agister's lien sale, but the owners paid part of their bill. Several months later, after feeding the horses over the winter, the agister again sent notice to the owners. The agister also called the owners twice to inform them of the sale. At the sheriff's sale, 55 of the owners' 129 horses were sold. The owners filed the action to set aside the sale. The trial court found that the sale was valid. Affirming, the court found that the owners received notice of the sale. The court found that the owners received notice in accordance with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 71-3-1203. The court concluded that the sale was valid because the agister complied with the requirements of &sect; 71-3-1203 and the sale was fair. The court found that the sale was reasonable even though the horses were sold in lots rather than individually. The court found that the trial court inappropriately took judicial notice of the owners' bill from the agister, but that it was harmless error because there was other evidence of the amount the owners owed him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual had been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, third offense.

Code Ann. &sect; 61-11-201, et. seq. In affirming the judgment, the court found that &sect; 61-12-601 was not unconstitutionally vague for failure to adequately describe prohibited conduct. It established the offense of unlawful operation of a motor vehicle by a minor and established the jurisdiction of the courts and the penalties which could be imposed. The statute was not deficient merely because one had to look to other statutes to determine whether the minor had unlawfully operated a motor vehicle. Further, the purpose expressed in &sect; 61-11-201 could be accomplished under the penalty provisions of &sect; 61-12-601(2)(b). Also, &sect; 61-12-601 did not contain the mandatory jail provisions applicable to adults convicted under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-401. The absence of incarceration was consistent with the philosophy expressed throughout Montana law to attempt to rehabilitate youthful offenders, not punish them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature passed 1985 Mont.

Ann. &sect; 17-6-308, which permitted the use of in-state investment fund monies derived from taxation to guarantee loans or bonds of private individuals or private entities, either directly or through the capital reserve account or the economic development guaranty fund, were unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of Lake County, Twentieth Judicial District (Montana) of mitigated deliberate homicide. In sentencing him, the district court designated him a dangerous offender. On appeal, the issues included whether such designation, coming after defendant was apparently originally sentenced, subjected him to double jeopardy contrary to U.S. Const. amend. V and Mont. Const. art. II, 25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he stabbed the victim, but he claimed that he did so in self-defense. On appeal, defendant argued that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury that if they found his use of force justified, they should acquit him of mitigated deliberate homicide and negligent homicide. After reviewing the instructions given, the court noted that the jury was instructed that they had to acquit defendant of deliberate homicide if they found his use of force was justified. Although one instruction was erroneous, it could not be an issue on appeal because defendant failed to object to it, he offered an almost identical instruction, and the instruction given benefitted him. The court held that the instructions given, when viewed as a whole, fully and fairly instructed the jury that self-defense was a complete defense to criminal homicide. It was not reversible error to fail to specifically instruct the jury to acquit defendant upon a finding of justifiable use of force. The court also held that an oral sentence first pronounced was not a final, valid judgment, so defendant was not thereby subjected to a first &quot;jeopardy.&quot; Thus, there could be no double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The State countered that the right to an independent test arose only after an accused took a test designated by the officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant refused to submit to a breath test, but agreed to submit to a blood test.

Although the sample was clearly marked &quot;Keep Refrigerated,&quot; it was left on the counter in the dispatch room and it was not given to defendant on his release. The sample was never analyzed, and the parties stipulated to its decreased validity. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court reversed. Under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-405(2), one accused of a crime involving intoxication had a right to an independent blood test regardless of whether he submitted to a police designated test. While the police had no duty to assist an accused in obtaining independent evidence of sobriety, they could not frustrate such an effort through either affirmative acts or rules and regulations. Once the sample was taken from defendant, the police had a duty to see to its safekeeping. The careless handling deprived defendant of his due process right to gather possible exculpatory evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a landowner, arrived at a meeting with county commissioners upset over the fact that the county, without his permission, had bladed a roadway across his property. Defendant was discourteous, bordering on the irrational, and he screamed at the commissioners. When told that he could sue, defendant mumbled a bad word, got up, stomped out, and slammed the door so hard that the glass in the room rattled. Based on that conduct, the trial court found defendant guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-8-101(1)(g). Noting that it was unnecessary to address the issue whether defendant's failure to raise the issue at trial precluded it from considering defendant's contention that &sect; 45-8-101(1)(g) was unconstitutionally vague, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction under the statute. To establish a misdemeanor under &sect; 45-8-101(1)(g), it was essential to show, as an element of the offense, a disturbance of public order and tranquillity by acts or conduct not merely amounting to unlawfulness but tending to create public tumult and incite others to break the peace. This the State did not do.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment and conviction was reversed and the cause was remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant candidate sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Gallatin County, 18th Judicial District (Mont.), which enjoined him from taking the office of county surveyor, declared the office vacant, dismissed his counterclaim and petition for mandamus, and awarded costs and attorney fees to plaintiff county and third-party defendant county clerk and recorder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate was elected to the office of county surveyor on a write-in ballot. The county commissioners challenged his qualifications, disputing that he met the statutory definition of &quot;professional engineer.&quot; On appeal, the candidate argued that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-4-2801(1) (1981) was unconstitutional in requiring the county surveyor to be a professional engineer. In reversing, the court ruled that, when the predecessor statute to &sect; 7-4-2801(1) was enacted, Mont. Const. art. IX, &sect; 11 (1889) and Mont. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 5 (1889) had no requirement for county surveyors to be engineers and that the subsequent codifications of the statute were not reenactments but merely ministerial and administrative functions performed by the code commissioner under the authority of the legislature. The court held, therefore, that Mont.

Code Ann. &sect; 7-33-2314, for a refund of ad valorem road taxes. Respondent county denied the claim. The taxpayer and plaintiffs, a rural fire district and a rural volunteer fireman's association, filed suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment exempting all qualified volunteer firefighters from road taxes in the county and also sought a refund of the road taxes paid by those firefighters. The district court found that the exemption statute was riddled with ambiguity, that the exemption statute referred to an archaic, fixed sum, per capita road tax, and that the exemption statute was intended to exempt firefighters from the ad valorem, property road tax. The court affirmed. The exemption statute referred to two per capita taxes, Mont. Pol. Code &sect; 4230 (1895) and Mont. Pol. Code &sect; 3960 (1895), which were no longer in existence. The exemption statute was ambiguous, unclear, and in need of statutory construction. Mont. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2 (1889) did not include firefighters' property among those types of property which were exempted from taxation. The court held that the legislature intended the exemption statute to exempt firefighters from the per capita road tax and not from the property road tax, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-14-2501. This interpretation gave effect to the statute and did not render it unconstitutional, as would an interpretation exempting firefighters' property.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of violating Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-203(1)(b) (1983). The court affirmed defendant's conviction. First, &sect; 45-5-203(1)(b) was not overbroad nor unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Although &sect; 45-5-203(1)(b) made criminal a form of pure speech, it was not substantially overbroad because it punished threats made by one to physically restrain another, words which were not protected speech under the First Amendment. Defendant's statements constituted threats punishable under &sect; 45-5-203(1)(b) because he threatened to take a hostage in order to bring public attention to his plight, words which were more than mere political opposition to the legal system. Moreover, &sect; 45-5-203(1)(b) curtailed no more speech than was necessary to protect against threats which caused harm to society. Second, defendant's constitutional right of access to the courts was not denied when he did not have access to a legal library during his pretrial confinement because counsel was assigned to do his legal research.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, who were defendants in a civil action to collect a debt, filed an action against respondents, a justice court and others, in which petitioners sought a declaratory judgment that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-15-203(2) and Mont. J. R. Civ. P. 14.F, requiring prepayment of jury fees in justice courts, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioners requested a jury trial, they were told that no jury would be called if they failed to pay the jury fee. On appeal, the court accepted jurisdiction because there was a justiciable controversy that had statewide impact because jury fee laws applied to all justice courts. Delay could result in abridging vital constitutional rights. It would promote judicial economy to accept jurisdiction rather than forcing piecemeal litigation as to the constitutionality of the laws. Next, the court held that the statute and the rule were unconstitutional. The plain language of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 26, stated that the right of trial by jury was secured to all and would remain inviolate. Furthermore, under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-31-1004, jury fees paid by parties demanding a jury trial were taxed as costs against the losing party. This suggested that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-15-203(2) was not a true mechanism for the recovery of costs but, rather, a device to discourage the exercise of the right to jury trial. The right to a jury trial was not inviolate if it were accorded only to those who could afford to pay for it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a driver and his employer, challenged the judgment of the District Court of Fallon County, Sixteenth Judicial District (Montana), which ruled in favor of respondent father in his action to recover for the wrongful death of his child. The trial court denied the motions by the driver and the employer for summary judgment, for dismissal, and for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was killed in an automobile accident by a truck operated by the driver. Two weeks after the accident, the legislature amended the wrongful death statute. Three years later, the father filed his action. The court held that the action by the father's ex-wife to recover for their child's wrongful death was not a bar to his action. At the moment of death, Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 93-2809 (1947) was in effect. Section 93-2809 gave the father a cause of action for the child's death. The cause of action was not affected by the legislature's subsequent enactment of the amended Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 93-2809 (1977) because the legislature did not make the amendment retroactive. Section 93-2809 was not declared retroactive by the legislature. Therefore, the father's action remained intact subject only to the three-year statute of limitations applicable to torts. Because the amended statute was not made retroactive, there existed, for the three-year statute of limitation period following its enactment, the possibility of two actions for wrongful death. The employer was not injured by the original statute, but by the legislature's decision not to make the amended statute retroactive.</SPAN></P>

The owners, who contended that their respective water rights had always been expressed in terms of flow rate, rather than volume, challenged the statutes' validity. They argued that any attempt to define volume in the decrees listing pre-July 1, 1973 water rights was speculative, placed an added burden on pre-July 1, 1973 rights, and violated Mont.

The judgment affirmed Petroleum County's and SRS's denial of medical benefits to an indigent family.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family's income at the time they applied for medical assistance exceeded the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) standard. The County's plan limited assistance to families with incomes less than the AFDC standard. The SRS also denied relief under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-3-103(3) (1983), based however not on the family's income at the time of application but upon a higher level income it had since obtained. In reversing the judgment the court first held that &sect; 53-3-103(3), and its successor provision, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-3-206(5), did not violate Mont. Const. art. XII, &sect; 3 (1972). The court applied mid-level scrutiny in reaching this conclusion. It was reasonable to assume that persons not eligible were not medically indigent. Also the State's interest in limiting benefits outweighed the interest of the people in receiving the benefits. A denial of benefits based solely on the income limitation in Petroleum County, Montana, County Medical Plan &sect; 6.1(A)(1)(a), also failed mid-level scrutiny, but the &sect; 6.1(A)(1)(b) spend-down provision saved the plan. The SRS erred however in using the family's current income in denying benefits.</SPAN></P>

The district court held in the revocation hearing that defendant violated his probation and imposed the suspended sentence. The court affirmed the contested judgment.

The court found that the revocation hearing satisfied the requirements of precedent and Mont.

The court held that the statutory procedure employed for the state to file the charges that revoked probation did not deny due process. The court found no reason to provide defendant with more due process than that afforded to unconvicted defendants. The court ruled that Mont.

The next day, the Governor of the State of Montana signed a repeal of the Montana veteran's preference statutes, which retroactively extinguished pending claims for violations of the former law. The university moved for a dismissal. The court held that the repeal of the preference gratuity and the dismissal of the veteran's claim to that gratuity did not violate the due process clauses of the Montana and United States Constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Montana's legislature passed House Bill 843, ch. 670, Mont. Laws (1985), which eliminated general assistance payments to able-bodied persons under 35 with no minor dependent children, and substantially restricted payments to able-bodied persons between 35 and 50 with no minor dependent children. A community group filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the bill. The trial court declared the bill unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that a classification which abridged welfare benefits in Montana was subject to more than a rational-basis scrutiny under an equal protection analysis. The state was required to show: 1) that its classification of welfare recipients on the basis of age was reasonable; and 2) that its interest in classifying welfare recipients on the basis of age was more important than the people's interest in obtaining welfare benefits. The court ruled that the state failed to show that misfortunate people under the age of 50 were more capable of surviving without assistance than those over 50, and the state's objective in saving money did not justify the abrogation of the welfare benefit, which was granted in Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The garbage haulers were private corporations authorized to collect garbage outside the city limits.

The garbage haulers filed an action against the city for damages and injunctive relief for violating &sect; 7-2-4736. The district court denied the injunction and later entered judgment for the city. The garbage haulers appealed. The city cross-appealed.

The court also concluded that &sect; 7-2-4736 was constitutional. The court reasoned that although &sect; 7-2-4736 granted a special privilege or franchise to the garbage haulers, the franchise was not an irrevocable one under 1972 Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 31.

Although the Montana constitution allowed an employee to be deprived of full legal redress against the employer, it did not deprive him of redress against third parties.

Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-107, which limited governmental liability for damages in tort, was unconstitutional. The driver filed a motion for summary judgment in his declaratory action. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the driver in his declaratory action holding that &sect; 2-9-107 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court found that the provision constituted an invasion by the legislature on a fundamental right granted under the state constitution to sue governmental entities for full legal redress. Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 gave a constitutional right of full legal redress for injury. By enacting Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-107, the legislature improperly limited that right without a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

It found that the repeal of the veterans' preference statute by &sect; 14 applied retroactively to bar the veterans' claim. The court held that the legislature properly could repeal the veterans' preference by a majority vote at any time. The veterans' preference was a gratuity, not a contractual right. The veteran did not have a reliance interest in the veterans' preference unless and until it was actually received. Before that point, he did not incur any direct, specific financial detriment in gaining the status of a veteran. The legislative history of &sect; 14 showed the legislature's valid and rational reasons for its actions. It was unequivocal in its aim to bar pending claims against the State. The legislature was concerned about fiscal integrity, employee competence, and academic freedom. Section 14 was a rational response to those legitimate concerns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court concluded that no material change of circumstances existed to warrant consideration of a change of custody.

The court found, however, that the district court could not restrict the visitation rights unless it first found that the existing visitation arrangement seriously endangered the child's physical, mental, moral, or emotional health and, therefore, remand was necessary to make such a finding. The court also determined that the husband's failure to make support payments occurred both before the wife left the state and after he learned of her whereabouts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer claimed that the Board of Hail Insurance was unconstitutional because the statutory duty of the State Auditor to serve on the Board violated Mont. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5 (1972), which prohibited dual office holding. The court rejected that contention because the only limitation imposed by Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, on the legislature's authority to assign duties to the State Auditor was a prohibition against imposing duties on him that appertained to the legislative or judicial departments of government. The statutory duty of being a member of the Board imposed on the state auditor did not violate that limitation. Nor did the State Auditor's service on the Board create any incompatibility or conflict of interest. The State Auditor has affirmatively alleged, and it was not denied, that he had never received any compensation, benefit, or gain from the Hail Insurance Program or from any other source for the performance of his duties as a Board member. There was no conflict of interest between the duty of the Board members to set hail insurance rates and the limited function of the State Auditor as insurance commissioner to review those rates.</SPAN></P>

The employee had settled the third-party claim for the insurance limit, which was less than the claimed value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had agreed that the employee was injured within the scope and course of his employment, the employer was enrolled under Plan 3 of the Workers' Compensation Act, and that the Fund was its compensation carrier. The Fund had accepted liability and had paid medical benefits, acknowledged liability for an indemnity for permanent partial disability and application of the AMA Guide published in 1971. The employee pursued a third-party claim as a result of the injury and settlement was reached for the $ 25,000 limit of insurance. The Fund claimed a subrogation interest and subtracted that amount from the indemnity award. The trial court conducted an administrative review and concluded that the subrogation interest was appropriate. The employee appealed, and the court held that because the employee had not obtained redress and was not made whole by the settlement, subrogation by the Fund was improper. Because Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 (1972) required full legal redress for an injured employee to apply Mont. Code. Ann. &sect; 39-71-414 where full redress was not obtained would be an unconstitutional application of an otherwise constitutional statute.</SPAN></P>

The division was sent copies of the orders striking the operators' prior DUI convictions but refused to strike the convictions from the operators' records. The court held that the justice court's decision was not res judicata because the issues considered in the two causes were not the same. The justice court examined the use of a prior uncounseled conviction for criminal DUI sentencing, while the trial court looked at the use of a prior uncounseled conviction in the civil matter of revoking a driver's license. The operators also argued that the division considered null and void convictions to revoke their licenses. The court disagreed, finding that the justice court's order granting the motions to strike did not affect the division's duty under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-11-102(2) to maintain the records of convictions of licensees. Thus, the justice court's striking of the convictions to avoid enhancement of the criminal penalty had nothing to do with the division's civil revocation of driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

The officer also noticed a piece of paper on the dashboard that looked like a &quot;nickel bag&quot; commonly used in the drug trade to hold cocaine. The officer later went back into the pickup without a warrant and removed the bag from under the seat. The bag contained marijuana. A cellophane wrapper of suspect marijuana was also found on the floor of the sheriff's office under a chair in which defendant had been sitting. An officer obtained a warrant, made a search of the pickup, and discovered cocaine. Defendant moved for the suppression of all evidence seized from the pickup. The court found that the cocaine was discovered for reasons independent of the prior illegal search that revealed marijuana.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the District Court of Hill County, Twelfth Judicial District (Montana) dismissing the charges against defendants under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-3-122. The State claimed that the district court erred in holding that &sect; 87-3-122 was invalid for failure to require criminal intent and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with shining a spotlight from a motorized vehicle while in possession of weapons in violation of &sect; 87-3-122. On appeal from the justice court, the district court held that &sect; 87-3-122 was invalid for failure to require a criminal mental state without meeting the requirements of an absolute liability offense and that it was void on its face for vagueness and overbreadth for failure to clarify the meaning of the term &quot;other implement.&quot; On further review, the court held that &sect; 87-3-122 was invalid. The court reasoned that because &sect; 87-3-122 exempted landowners, lessees, and agents, it allowed for arbitrary application. The court determined that the object of &sect; 87-3-122 was to create an absolute liability offense of spotlighting with weapons in vehicles with exceptions, which denied equal protection and failed to promote justice. Because the statute mentioned domestic animals, the court held that it was not rationally related to the protection of wildlife, its intended purpose. The court also held that the statute was a nullity as amended because its original purpose was to provide exemptions and exceptions to other offenses under the fish and game title.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order by which the district court dismissed the charges against defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant bank challenged a judgment of the District Court of Cascade County (Montana) which found for plaintiff customer that the bank wrongfully honored checks on a partnership account without the customer's approval and retaliated to the customer's lawsuit by refusing to make automatic loan advances on a personal account. The bank contended that the trial court erred in ruling on its objections to the jury panel and the jury selection process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer filed a complaint alleging that the bank wrongfully honored checks on a partnership account without the customer's approval, and that the bank retaliated for the initial suit by refusing to make automatic loan advances on a personal account. The jury verdict awarded the customer compensatory and punitive damages. The bank contended that there was a material deviation or departure from the statutes on jury selection, and that, as a result, the parties did not have a trial before a fair and impartial jury. The clerks had examined prospective jurors using questions given them by the customer's counsel without any notice to the counsel for the bank. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding that the process used in selecting the jury panel violated Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-7-223 because the existence of a bank-depositor relation did not disqualify a juror under the statute unless a party raised a challenge for cause to the court. The court also found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying a motion to consolidate and in excluding tax returns and financial statements insofar as they reflected collateral benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants sought a certificate of need to establish a home healthcare agency with Montana's Department of Health and Environmental Sciences. The Department denied the application stating that the county's home healthcare needs was already being met by the home healthcare agency.

The agency then sought review to the lower court, which upheld the Board's decision. The agency sought further review. On appeal, the court further upheld the judgment. The court ruled that there was substantial credible evidence in the record to support the Board's determination that a certificate of need should be issued to the applicants. The court concluded that Mont. Admin. R. &sect; 16.32.110 was the proper rule to be considered in the determination of the cause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was a juvenile at the time the crime was committed, was convicted of deliberate homicide and sentenced to 100 years imprisonment. He appealed from the judgment of the District Court of the Fifteenth Judicial District, Roosevelt County, Montana, claiming as error the denials of his motions to suppress and to change venue, the jury verdict, and the sentence imposed. He also claimed that the district court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several years after the victim was killed, defendant was arrested on an unrelated charge. Due to threats he made and his failure to post bail, defendant was kept in custody. Three days after his arrest, two stress indicative tests were conducted. After being told that his answers to questions were apparently untruthful, defendant confessed to the murder. The court held that the youth court's original exclusive jurisdiction terminated upon defendant's turning 21, and no bar existed to the district court's exercise of jurisdiction. The denial of defendant's second motion to change venue after venue was transferred to an adjoining county was proper, as the district court reserved the right to review the motion if an impartial jury was not found. The denial of defendant's motion to suppress his confession was not an abuse of discretion. There was no temporal proximity between the arrest and the confession, he did not diligently pursue his right to release, he did not show that the delay of his initial appearance was unnecessary or unreasonably long, and the voluntariness of his confession was evidenced by the 10 Miranda warnings he was given and the eight waivers that he signed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted defendant of deliberate homicide and imposed a sentence of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

Twenty-three water rights were involved in the action, including groundwater wells on school trust lands, developed springs, diversions of tributaries, and direct use. The school trust lands were granted to the state of Montana by the federal government in the Montana Enabling Act of 1889. The lands were held in trust for the benefit of public education in the state by the Montana Board of Land Commissioners. The court found that the lessees were acting on behalf of the State in putting the water to beneficial use. The court held that although the lease terms entitled the lessees to use of water appurtenant to school trust lands, the State was the beneficial user of the water, and its duties as trustee of the school trust lands prohibited alienation of any interest in the land without full compensation. The court held that the lessees acquired their interest in the property subject to the trust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner claimed that the city violated &sect; 18-2-401 et seq. in a transaction in which a private company agreed to build a vehicle storage facility on city land and then lease the building back to the city. The lessor contracted with a construction company independently of the lease agreement. However, the trial court found that the contract violated the prevailing wage law governing public projects. On appeal, the court held that the law was not an unconstitutional delegation of power to private groups because it allowed the commissioner to determine the prevailing wage, in part, based on collective bargaining agreements. There was substantial credible evidence to support the finding that the &quot;lease&quot; was in fact a sale of the building to the city and that that was in effect a public works project. However, the trial court erred by allowing into evidence letters written by local employers concerning the wages paid to their workers. The letters were hearsay and did not fall into the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Because the damage award was based in part on information contained in the inadmissible letters, the trial court had to redetermine its award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and remanded the trial court's decision on damages and affirmed the remainder of the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord entered the defendants' apartment after he noticed an alarming increase in the electric bill and after he noticed a bright light coming from the attic. He discovered a grow light and 657 marijuana plants. The landlord reported this information to the police, a warrant was issued, and the plants were seized. The court overturned the rule that held that private searches invaded privacy rights protected by the Montana Constitution and were properly the subject of the state's exclusionary rule. The court held that the privacy section of the Montana Constitution, Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 (1971), contemplated privacy invasion by state action only. The court reasoned that the exclusionary rule was a rule of court procedure to deny admission to the fruits of illegally seized evidence in order to deter unlawful police activities and to preserve the integrity of the judiciary itself.</SPAN></P>

The issue on appeal was whether the State could suspend the driver's license pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-402 when the arresting officer failed to seize the driver's license and failed to issue a 72-hour temporary driving permit as required by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-402(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer who pulled the driver over admitted that he failed to issue a 72-hour temporary driving permit as required by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-402(4). The court held that such a failure did not deprive the State of its right to suspend the driver's operating privileges under the implied consent law. The officer's error did not deprive the driver of property because, although the State failed to issue him a temporary permit, it also failed to seize his license. The driver would have been entitled to relief only if he were prejudiced by a denial of due process. Additionally, the driver did not have a constitutional right to a pre-suspension hearing and due process was satisfied by a prompt post-suspension hearing. The driver continued in possession of his driver's license until the action of the MVD for suspension. He was then given a prompt hearing and a temporary stay of suspension. He had no grounds to complain about lack of notice of appeal rights at the outset.</SPAN></P>

The driver raised various constitutional issues regarding the revocation procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was adjudicated a habitual traffic offender per the Habitual Traffic Offender Act. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-11-203 set the number of points for each violation; the driver had 31 points. The court wrote that the driver was entitled to due process but not as much as required for criminal proceedings because the revocation proceeding under the Act was not criminal. The court rejected the argument that there had to be a post-dispositional hearing because the driver had a hearing before the revocation, and it was a judicial and not an administrative one, and there was an appeal allowed to the court. The court rejected the argument that the inability of judges to set what was needed for revocation was fatal; the trial court had discretion to determine the sufficiency of traffic offense records, which ensured adequacy of the hearings. It was within the legislative power to decide the seriousness of various traffic offenses; it was significant that the point system was not set administratively. The court rejected the argument that the State was required to tell every traffic violator of the right to counsel or not use the violations for revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' relatives purchased land and constructed a house on it that extended onto property owned by a corporation.

Code Ann. &sect; 49-2-310, -311 (1983), was invalid and reversed the Commission's decision that required petitioner employer to give the employee back wages and to pay penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a regular employee of the employer, became pregnant shortly after commencing employment. She experienced early &quot;morning sickness&quot; as a result of her pregnancy, and missed time from work. She was soon terminated due to pregnancy. At the time of her termination, she had been employed with the employer for less than one year. The employer had a policy of not providing a leave of absence to any employee who had been employed with the employer for less than one year. In reversing the lower court's decision, the court held that the employer's termination of the employee was in direct contravention of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and the MMLA. The court held that the MMLA was not preempted by the federal acts, as it was consistent with such acts, and the federal acts expressly permitted state action in the same field. Further, the employer's policy, although facially neutral, had a disparate impact on women. However, because the MMLA only applied to pregnant women, the court suggested that the legislature extend the MMLA to apply to all disabled workers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to prove purpose or knowledge, and that he should have been sentenced to a term at the State Mental Hospital.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence that defendant went into the victim's home thinking that a woman who owed him money was inside, that he thought he put his arm around her neck and hand over her mouth, and that he was caught fleeing from the scene of the assault was sufficient to support a jury finding that he acted purposely under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-101(58) and/or knowingly under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-202(33) when he committed the assault. The sentence was vacated, however, because the trial court erred when it sentenced defendant to state prison without making a finding pursuant to Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information was filed charging defendant with two counts of aggravated kidnapping and one count of solicitation. The charges arose out of his having gone to his wife's house, from whom he was separated, to retrieve a briefcase that he believed she had taken from his truck. The two of them fought, and defendant struck his wife on the head with a gun. He then placed her in his truck face down on the seat with her arms pinioned. Defendant was convicted on the lesser-included offenses. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to disqualify the county attorney's office because the fact that a deputy county attorney, who office shared with the county attorney in his private practice, represented defendant's wife in their divorce did not establish a conflict of interest. The state was only required to prove that defendant acted knowingly and purposely. Defendant's status as a member of the county sheriff's posse made him merely an auxiliary officer. Thus, his authority to arrest was no greater than that of a private citizen and he had no authority to arrest his wife. Defendant's sentences were within the statutory limits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for simple assault and unlawful restraint and the sentence imposed as a result of the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Regarding the Montana corporation license tax and taxable income interest from federal obligations, the court determined the validity of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-116 with regard to the taxpayer, a corporation. The court held that the net effect of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-116 was to add back to taxable income interest income from federal obligations for the purpose of determining state corporation license tax. This, states were not permitted to do. Under 31 U.S.C. S. &sect; 3124, both federal obligations and interest therefrom were exempt from taxation by states directly or indirectly in the computation of tax, unless the tax was specifically excepted in &sect; 3124(1) or (2). Because the court held in a prior case that the corporation license tax was not a franchise tax, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-116, standing alone, was invalid. It directly contravened a federal law and as such violated the Supremacy Clause of U.S. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the sentences could legally have been set to run consecutively. The court held that the sentences were not disproportionate to the crimes, noting the dangerousness and persistence of defendant's behavior. The court held that it was not unconstitutional that defendant had to serve her sentence in the county jail even though, unlike prisoners in state prison, she was not eligible to earn good time credits. The court held that the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to jail time as opposed to alcohol rehabilitation because Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-24-303(2) provided treatment for persons incapacitated by alcohol but did not prohibit jail time for drunk drivers. The court also held that Mont. Const. art.

Defendant was found guilty of attempted deliberate homicide and aggravated assault and was sentenced to concurrent terms at a state prison. Defendant appealed and the court remanded the cause for resentencing. The court held that the county attorney's failure to give the court and defendant notice of a new rebuttal witness constituted clear error, which did not rise to the level of reversible error. The court held that the trial judge's refusal to independently evaluate defendant's mental condition flew in the face of the court's basic duty and compelled the court to vacate defendant's sentence and remand for resentencing. The court determined that the fact that the jury found the existence of a requisite mental state did not conclusively establish defendant's sanity or fitness for penal punishment. The court found that that determination was to have been independently made by the sentencing judge and the record was to have reflected the deliberative process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The constable impounded the truck. The guest argued the prejudgment attachment was not properly issued and that the truck was exempt from attachment because it was part of the marital estate and was essential to his employment. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in denying certiorari because the alleged contract at issue was not one for the direct payment of money. The court rejected the hotel owner's argument that his averment of indebtedness in his supporting affidavit for the attachment was sufficient because the statute explicitly required that the contract on which the indebtedness was based must have been for the direct payment of money. An implied contract not to damage a hotel room failed to qualify as a contract for the direct payment of money. The justice of the peace erred in issuing the attachment because the guest's obligation to the hotel owner had not been reduced to a judgment at the time the owner requested the writ of attachment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decision to retroactively apply a court decision interpreting the Veterans and Handicapped Civilians Employment Preference Act (Act), Mont.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sued to force the county treasurer to accept his tender of delinquent property tax payments, interest, and penalty, which was refused by the treasurer because the amount tendered was insufficient based upon an amended interest rate. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's suit. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the state legislature intended a retroactive effect to be given to its statutory amendment increasing the interest rate on delinquent taxes because it specifically applied to taxes that became due before a certain date, such as the taxpayer's payments, but remained unpaid on or after that date. The court held that the retrospective application of the amendment increasing the rate of interest on delinquent taxes did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, or Montana's due process clause, Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 (1972), or equal protection clause, Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4 (1972).

Defendant entered another apartment and stole a purse. Defendant subsequently returned to the second apartment and stabbed a sleeping woman 35 times with the stolen knife. When a man entered the room, defendant stabbed him in the leg and fled. Defendant was arrested wearing a jacket stained with the woman's blood. Defendant also confessed after receiving his Miranda rights. The trial court ordered five mental examinations of defendant prior to trial and found him fit to proceed. At trial, defendant relied on the defense of mental disease or defect. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the law of mental disease and defect, and that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment in light of the finding that he suffered from a serious mental disorder. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The challenged instruction did not allow the jury to presume that criminal intent existed. Moreover, defendant's sentence did not constitute the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The State petitioned the trial court for permanent custody and authority to assent to adoption. The trial court denied the parents jury demand. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in favor of the State. The court held that neither the state laws nor the state constitution provided the parents with the right to a jury trial in this type of hearing. The evidence presented a dismal picture for the parents, and consequently, for the children. The parents were poorly educated and did not know how to properly care for and provide for the children. There was substantial evidence to support the trial court's findings and conclusions that the children were in need of care, that the parents had not complied with a treatment plan, and that the parents were beyond rehabilitation. While the trial court should have allowed the parents to cross-examine a doctor regarding the best interests of the children, the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence against allowing the children to remain with the parents.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 46-19-103 was not a bill of attainder. Death by lethal injection was not a legislatively created punishment. The punishment was the sentence of death. The inmate's punishment was pronounced by a judge following a trial and numerous other court proceedings. Hanging and lethal injection were merely alternate methods for imposing that punishment.

Code Ann. &sect; 53-21-130, the 10-day transfer statute, was a violation of due process. Respondents, the department of institutions and others, appealed from an order of the District Court of Deer Lodge County, Third Judicial District (Montana), which granted habeas relief and held that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was committed to the custody of the department and initially placed at a juvenile facility. He was transferred to the state hospital pursuant a voluntary admission. When he gave notice that he wanted to be released, the department filed a petition for involuntary commitment. Due to the failure to file a professional status report, the petition was dismissed and petitioner was returned to the juvenile facility. The juvenile was later transferred to the state hospital under the transfer statute. The district court held the statute was unconstitutional because it allowed transfer without a prior due process proceeding finding serious mental illness. Applying the traditional due process balancing test, the court overturned that part of the order striking down the statute. Although there was a risk that a person could be erroneously transferred for 10 days to a mental institution, that fact had to be weighed against the State's interest in maintaining the capability to transfer individuals in emergency situations, which was a compelling one. The grant of habeas relief was upheld because the juvenile was not afforded any procedural safeguards after the 10-day period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the district court's order declaring the statute unconstitutional and affirmed the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;41-5-103, which allowed a youth in need of supervision who had violated her probation to be adjudged a delinquent youth, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The youth signed a consent order, but violated it. After hearing and predispositional evaluation at girls' school, the youth court found her delinquent and gave her one year of probation. She appealed, alleging unconstitutionality. The court held that by continuing to be truant, her misconduct could be classified as truancy or as contempt of a court order. The youth court properly exercised its discretion in finding her a delinquent youth. Youthful contemnors who had been deemed delinquent youths did not constitute a suspect class for purposes of equal protection. Further, under the Montana Constitution, physical liberty was a fundamental right. Deprivation of the youth's physical liberty was sufficient to constitute infringement. Yet, this right to physical liberty must be balanced against her right to be supervised, cared for, and rehabilitated. The youth court's power to classify contempt of court misconduct of juvenile offenders on a case by case basis did not violate equal protection guarantees. The youth was a contemnor: she violated the court's order in addition to committing a status offense. Thus, the youth court's orders did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Laws 705 were void and unconstitutional. The laws allowed the issuance of state revenue bonds, which were financed by coal severance taxes to provide proceeds for the development of state water resources.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montana Legislature enacted 1981 Mont. Laws 505 and 1983 Mont. Laws 705 allowing the issuance of state revenue bonds, which were financed by coal severance taxes to provide proceeds for the development of state water resources. The citizen challenged the constitutionality of the laws and the application of the bond proceeds to the particular dam projects proposed by the legislature to receive the proceeds. Both the citizen and the State stipulated that there were no disputed facts. The court determined that it had original jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment, and that the citizen, as a taxpayer, had standing. The court held against the citizen and granted a declaratory judgment in favor of the State. The court concluded that the challenged laws and the proposed uses of the bond proceeds were valid and constitutional. The funds derived from the sale of the coal tax severance bonds were to be expended by a state agency under the control of the State for the construction of hydroelectric power projects. The laws were not unconstitutional merely because the appropriations in some way benefitted incidentally various private individuals, associations, or corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State claimed that the registered voters did not have standing to maintain the action because they were not sufficiently affected by &sect;&sect; 3-1-607 and -608. The State argued that the voters were not deprived of their right to vote but merely were precluded from casting ballots for judges who did not resign their offices in order to run for other judicial offices. The court held that Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10 was intended to benefit the public as a whole rather than to confer special privileges on the judiciary. In the court's view, &sect; 10 was intended to give the public a potentially broader choice in exercising the constitutional right to vote for judicial candidates. The court held that the voters had standing to assert that Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-1-607 and 608 diminished their constitutional right to vote. The court opined that the language &quot;other than a judicial position&quot; in Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10 meant that judicial office-holders could file for other judicial offices without forfeiting their offices. Thus, because Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-1-607 and -608 forbid what Mont.

His sentence was affirmed by the court, which held that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the victim sustained serious bodily injury. A victim faced serious bodily injury if there was an element of substantial risk of death. Actual death was not a component of serious bodily injury. Although defendant asserted that &sect; 45-5-303(2), unconstitutionally placed the burden on him to disprove that the victim suffered serious bodily injury in order to avoid sentence enhancement, the court found it unnecessary to reach that issue because the prosecution had actually assumed the burden of proving such injury in this matter. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-223(3), which set forth the standards for determining the applicability of exceptions to mandatory minimum sentences, but the court noted that this statute had not been used in this matter and refused to look at this issue.</SPAN></P>

The evidence showed that defendant had been employed on a ranch as the ranch bookkeeper. Defendant and her husband took care of the ranch's day-to-day operations. At direction of the manager of the ranch, defendant and her husband disposed of cattle belonging to the ranch at a market. Because the manager desired to have to sale appear that it took place the following year for tax purposes, the funds were deposited in a bank time certificate of deposit. When the certificate matured, defendant went and cashed it out. In order to hide the transaction, the manager instructed defendant not to deposit the interest earned in the ranch's bank account. Defendant, at the direction of her attorney, later refused to turn over the interest until the manager, who had subsequently fired her, paid her $ 500, which was the value of a garden that defendant was forced to leave. Defendant's conviction was reversed on appeal and the counts against her were dismissed because her threat to withhold the check did not constitute intimidation and because she did not commit a crime under Mont.

The issue had been before the district court pursuant to a petition for judicial review of an order by respondent Board of Personnel Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to its repeal in 1975, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 31-105 (1947) provided for one percent longevity increments for the state highway patrol officers. The statute was repealed as part of an overall statewide classification and pay plan adopted by the Montana Legislature in 1975. Under the plan, no current employee's salary was to be reduced. The patrol officers argued that the repeal of the one percent longevity increments interfered with their vested contractual rights. The Board made findings of fact but left the legal conclusions to the district court. Thereafter, the district court rejected the patrol officers' claims. The court upheld the district court's order, explaining that the patrol officers' entitlement to a longevity increase did not accrue until it had been earned. Thus, the Legislature was permitted to alter the benefits to the extent that they had not yet been earned by the patrol officers. In this case, there was no dispute that all earned longevity increases had been paid. Moreover, there was no claim that the patrol officers salaries under the new plan had been reduced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an investigation of a citizen's complaint about a police officer, the officer refused an order to submit to a polygraph test. The police commission found the officer guilty of insubordination. The officer filed a petition for review and argued that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-304(2) was unconstitutional as it applied to police officers. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the challenged part of the statute violated the officer's right to equal protection. The court found that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-304(2) created a classification of people who did not receive the protection against compelled polygraphs provided in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-304(1). The court concluded that there was no rational basis discernible from the statute that justified the exclusion of employees of &quot;public law enforcement agencies&quot; from the protection given to all other employees in the state. The court ruled that in order to withdraw the blanket statutory protection to all employees from a class of employees, the legislature was required to define the class and set forth the policy behind denying the protection.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded the case. The recall petition's allegations were not sufficient to justify recall under the Act when the petition failed to state whether the mayor provided reasons for the demotion, or whether any reasons he provided were deemed inadequate. Furthermore, the city ordinance cited by the election commissioner was not applicable to the mayor's demotion of police officers. The recall petition also did not describe how the mayor conducted the council meetings and did not describe the vulgar language.

Code Ann. &sect; 69-3-102, which provided the commission with the &quot;full power of supervision, regulation, and control&quot; of public utilities. The court reversed the decision below after analyzing the various statutes related to the utilities commission. The court held that the commission had no statutory authority, express or implied, to enter an injunction that prohibited a corporate reorganization. The court further held that because the utilities commission failed to submit any evidence to support its actions, the district court had no factual basis on which to exercise the power that it had to enter an injunction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the utilities commission lacked statutory authority to issue such an injunction and that the district court had no basis to issue an injunction because no evidence was submitted to substantiate the utilities commission's contentions. The court remanded the cause for entry of an appropriate writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The admission in evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a blood-alcohol test in a driving under the influence prosecution did not violate that defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

The court was unable to say that Oregon's contract with the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences amounts to substantial activity within Montana.

The first defendant had abandoned his department at the time his landlord consented to a police search of the premises. The trial court made no errors in utilizing the sentence enhancement statutes for use of weapons. The second defendant had the opportunity to refute items in a presentence report and failed to do so; therefore, the issue was precluded on appeal.

The search of defendant's home yielded various drug paraphernalia, a quantity of hashish, and the unopened package. Defendant was convicted of possession of dangerous drugs with intent to sell. He claimed that the drug evidence should have been suppressed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the inspector's search was not random. Rather, he was searching for packages that contained disease or insects and had probable cause to search the package. Further, his seizure was proper under the plain view rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal sale of dangerous drugs based upon a sale that had been arranged by an undercover agent.

Defendant appealed his sentence and forfeiture, and the court affirmed the conviction but remanded for resentencing under a different district court judge.

The court held that the judge was not entitled to sentence on the basis of such private contact and that the contact affected defendant's substantial right to due process during his sentencing. The court held that the forfeiture was not unconstitutional because the statute afforded due process through notice and hearing to the property owner whose possession had been seized.

The game warden's action sought to void his forced retirement at age 60 and to reinstate him to his position with attorney fees, costs, and backpay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The game warden was compulsorily retired at age 60 pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 19-8-601(2) of the Montana Game Wardens Retirement Act (Retirement Act). The trial court granted the department's motion to dismiss based on the game warden's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Although the game warden argued that enforcement of the Retirement Act violated the equal protection clause of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, the court decided the case on statutory grounds. The court reversed the order of dismissal and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the Montana Human Rights Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-2-303(1), 49-3-201, necessarily repealed the Retirement Act to the extent of any irreconcilable conflict or inconsistency. The court found that the clear intent of the legislature to abolish age discrimination mandated the implied repeal. The court held that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply because the action was an original action and because the original administrative ruling was an interpretation of law, which was a judicial function. Finally, the court held that the department waived its statute of limitations defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that dismissed the game warden's action against the department to void his forced retirement at age 60.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Cascade County, Eighth Judicial District (Montana), dismissed an appeal by petitioner, the Montana Department of Revenue (DOR), from an order of the State Tax Appeal Board (STAB) that remanded respondent taxpayers' protests to the DOR for reappraisal of commercial properties in a manner which did not violate the constitutional and statutory requirements for equalization. The DOR appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that the DOR's use of disparate manuals in appraising commercial and residential property had resulted in inequitable appraisals of property for taxation, the commercial properties being appraised at or near market value, while the residential properties were appraised substantially below market value. The court found that STAB, an administrative agency, did not have the power to remand the cases to the DOR, a separate agency. Rather, under statutory procedures, STAB was required to take evidence with respect to the individual protestors to determine if their individual properties were overvalued in accordance with specified criteria. Based on that evidence, in protests over which STAB had jurisdiction, it had the power to affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the County Tax Appeal Boards, as provided in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-2-301. There was no record of the specific dollar amount of unequal valuation or discrimination applying to the individual protesting taxpayers. It was STAB's duty to determine the individual effect of the discriminatory method of appraisal before STAB could affirm, modify, or reverse the County Tax Appeal Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the district court refusing judicial review and remanded the cause to STAB for further evidentiary proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant individual sought review of a summary judgment issued by the Fifth Judicial District Court of Madison County (Montana), which held a tax deed to defendant to be void, declared plaintiffs, successors to a partnership that was delinquent in paying taxes on the contested property, entitled to redeem and have title to the property sold to defendant, and barred defendant from asserting any claim to the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A partnership was delinquent in paying taxes due on certain realty and the county treasurer issued a tax deed that was assigned to defendant. Plaintiffs, the successors to the partnership, argued in their complaint against defendant that the tax deed was wrongfully issued and inadequately noticed and that they relied on defendant's alleged statement to them that he would not seek the tax deed. After plaintiffs moved for summary judgment based on errors in defendant's tax deed application procedure, the trial court granted the motion and defendant appealed. The court affirmed, ruling that summary judgment was appropriate because defendant failed to come forward with affidavits in dispute of plaintiffs' averments. Furthermore, the errors and omissions in the tax deed proceedings were sufficient to deny the county treasurer jurisdiction to issue the tax deed. Not only did the notice fail to give a complete date as to time for redemption, but the affidavit of service of notice of the application for tax deed failed to adequately describe the property, making the process fatally defective. Thus, plaintiffs were allowed to redeem the property by paying taxes owed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and his family were trying to prevent defendant's 20-year-old co-defendant son from taking the victim's teenage daughter out of state. Defendant shot the victim during a confrontation with the victim's family. Defendant alleged self-defense and that the victim was coming at defendant with a bat. Witnesses testified that 20 feet separated defendant and the victim and that defendant was the aggressor. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in charging the jury, in admission of evidence, in sentencing defendant, and in imposing costs against defendant. Defendant alleged that the state's trial tactics deprived him of a fair trial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court held that the state was not required to prove that the homicide was premeditated, but rather that defendant acted knowingly and purposely. The state properly introduced evidence of the victim's good character to refute defendant's self-defense theory. Admission of testimony that was not material or prejudicial to defendant was not error. Twelve of the 55 jury instructions related to self-defense. The jury instructions, taken as a whole, fairly presented the case to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Defendant offered to sell the agent one pound of cocaine. The agent declined. He stated that he was interested in purchasing 11 pounds of cocaine. The agent performed a field test on the substance and the first test was negative and the second test was positive. A positive test did not necessarily indicate that the substance was cocaine, since the results could be positive for several substances, including lidocaine, a prescription drug, not defined as a dangerous drug under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 50-32-101. Defendant and his wife testified that the substance offered for sale was in fact lidocaine and not cocaine. Defendant was convicted of felony sale of a dangerous drug, and felony attempt. On appeal the court reversed the conviction of felony sale of a dangerous drug. The court held that because there was no evidence that defendant believed that he was in fact offering cocaine for sale that the evidence was not sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain his conviction under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-9-101. The court affirmed his conviction for felony attempt because he defrauded the agent in the transaction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-2-104 and Mont. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-5-212, which imposed sanctions on district court judges and supreme court justices if decisions were not reached or opinions were not written within the procedural constraints and time limits set by the statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a judge of another district court, filed an action that challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 3-2-104, which applied to supreme court justices, and Mont. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-5-212, which applied to district court judges. Both sections imposed forfeiture of a justice's or judge's salary in the event of a violation of the procedures and the time limited imposed in the two sections. The district court held that both sections were unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) the question of when cases were to be decided and the manner in which they were to be decided was a matter solely for the judicial branch of government because of the separation of powers doctrine; (2) the salary forfeiture provisions violated the state constitutional prohibition against diminution of judicial salaries during their terms of office as well as the federal and state constitutional prohibitions against the impairment of contract; and (3) the internal operations of the courts were not subject to legislative veto because the constitutional provision that gave rule-making power to the supreme court and veto power to the legislature did not encompass the two statutes.</SPAN></P>
