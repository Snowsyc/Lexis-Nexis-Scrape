Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-105, which provided for state immunity from exemplary and punitive damages, were both unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that although the state had a valid interest in protecting its treasury, payment of tort judgments was simply a cost of doing business. Under the strict scrutiny test, &sect; 2-9-104 was unconstitutional because the Montana Constitution guaranteed that all persons would have a speedy remedy for every injury. However, &sect; 2-9-105 was constitutional. Under the rational basis test, an award of punitive damages against the state punished only the taxpayers and created a windfall to the injured party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant initiative petitioners sought review from the judgment of the District Court of Yellowstone County (Montana), which declared that respondent school's policy prohibiting the petitioners from collecting signatures within buildings used as polling places on election days did not violate the petitioners' statutory or constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioners contended the policy violated state statute, equal protection, U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and their state counterparts, and the express right to initiative guaranteed by the Mont. Const. of 1972. The court reversed and held that while Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 13-35-218(5), in and of itself, did not preclude the school district from prohibiting solicitation of initiative petition signatures within school buildings used as polling places, the lower court erred by failing to apply the incompatibility test of case law. The court therefore found that the school district's policy was not premised on actual disruptions and was not narrowly tailored to further the interest of undisrupted school functioning. The court noted less restrictive means of achieving the objective were not tried. The court therefore held that the school district's policy unnecessarily infringed on the petitioners' First Amendment liberties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for aggravated assault, aggravated burglary, and attempted sexual intercourse without consent in the District Court of Cascade County, Eighth Judicial District (Montana). Defendant argued that he was denied the right to assert an alibi defense, he was prejudiced by the failure to sequester a witness, comment on a past crime was error; double jeopardy was violated, and exhibits were improperly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the 12-year-old victim awakened, she found defendant standing over her with a knife. The victim tried to escape, but defendant stabbed her six times and attempted to rape her. Defendant was scared off by noises, but when the victim was being placed into an ambulance, defendant appeared covered with the victim's blood. Defendant was convicted, he appealed, and the court affirmed. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's first request to assert an alibi defense. Although it was error to deny defendant the right to assert an alibi defense after the information was amended, the error was not prejudicial because the alibi was frivolous as a matter of law. It was not error to allow the State to add witnesses one day before trial, and defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice by the testimony of a witness who was not properly sequestered. Defendant was not denied a fair trial by references to his past penitentiary sentence. Ample independent evidence supported each of the charged crimes, so defendant was not placed in double jeopardy. The chain of custody was adequate, and exhibits, including vials of the victim's blood, were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Missoula County (Montana), which upheld her conviction in the municipal court for numerous parking ordinance violations. Two of the charges were brought under Missoula, Mont., Code &sect;&sect; 20-115, 20-118, but the majority of the charges were brought under &sect;&sect; 20-132(c), 20-184.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the parking ordinances as unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the complaints against defendant, concluding that the prima facie presumption in Missoula, Mont., Code &sect; 20-184, was unconstitutional and invalid because it resulted in an impermissible shifting of the burden of persuasion. Under &sect; 20-184, the registered owner of the vehicle was presumed to be the person who parked the vehicle. The court, however, concluded that vicarious criminal responsibility could be imposed in the regulation of traffic and the parking of vehicles without breaching due process restrictions. The court overruled State v. Jetty, 176 Mont. 519, 579 P.2d 1228 (1978), to the extent that it held to the contrary. Nonetheless, the Missoula vicarious liability parking ordinances could not be accepted as valid instruments for the imposition of vicarious liability because they provided a maximum penalty that exceeded the maximum allowed by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-104. The court also held that the escalating fine provisions of the parking ordinances violated the Montana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in permitting references to his previous trial and in instructing the jury that he was presumed to have intended the consequences of his actions. In reversing, the court ruled that the challenged instruction went to a vital element of the proof of the crime, namely the intent of defendant in committing the homicide, and that if the jury followed the instruction, it could have presumed the intent without proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the error was not harmless because intent was a central issue in the defense theory that defendant fired a warning shot and did not intend to kill the victim. The court recommended that, on retrial, the trial court direct defense counsel not to mention the prior trial, which had opened the door to other references to the first trial. The court also recommended a change of venue, noting that the case was the subject of controversy in a county having a population of less than a thousand people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An accomplice testified that defendant assisted in burglarizing a company and a service station. At trial, defense counsel admitted defendant's criminal record in order to show that he would not have been involved in the burglaries. Defendant claimed that the accomplice's testimony was not sufficiently corroborated and that his attorney was ineffective. On appeal, the court found that defendant's possession of the stolen items was sufficient as a matter of law to corroborate the accomplice's testimony. It was for the jury to determine the weight to be given to defendant's testimony seeking to explain away the possession. However, evidence of defendant's previous criminal charges, which included evidence of defendant being involved in an alleged burglary where he claimed another man brought the stolen items into his house, would not have been admitted but for the actions of defense counsel. The evidence was extremely prejudicial showing circumstances almost identical to the current case.

Defendant was convicted of both citations and appealed. The court held that the State possessed an inherent power to enact reasonable legislation for the health, safety, welfare, or morals of the public. The court stated that such a police power existed, even though the regulation might be an infringement of individual rights. The court also noted that the courts had consistently implied or expressly acknowledged the power of the State to require licensing procedures to be followed prior to use of the highways and had acknowledged the State's power to properly regulate traffic on the highways. Finally, the court determined that the State had the power to regulate licensing of drivers in the interests of public safety, and the State's exercise of police power in setting speed limits was in the best interests of the State's economy and in keeping with the national goals of conservation of gasoline and oil and of improved safety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, plaintiff state senators sought a declaratory judgment that H.B. 872, amending Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5-17-101 and 5-17-102 dealing with the Capitol renovation program, violated the Montana Constitution and several Montana statutes. Defendant Department of Administration denied all statutory and constitutional violations and moved for a summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 5-17-101 provided that the Capitol Building and Planning Committee (committee) was to serve as the Legislature's representative in planning the remodeling of the Capitol. The bill gave the committee the right to decide the allocation and use of space, including without limitation the location of legislative chambers. The committee decided that the Senate chambers were to be moved and the senators sought to block that decision. The court held that the committee was required to report its decision to the full Legislature for approval. The court found that because it had determined that the Legislature intended for the committee's decision to be ratified by the whole Legislature, there had been no unconstitutional delegation of authority. The court held that the Department could allocate space for the legislative branch of government, but the Legislature, being an independent body, had the right to determine where it would sit. Until the full Legislature had approved the decision of the committee for removal of the Senate chambers, the Department was powerless to allocate space for the Senate chambers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the prayer of the senators for a declaratory judgment and issued an injunction against further proceedings with respect to the Capitol remodeling, until the consent of the Legislature as a whole had been obtained for relocation of the State Senate chambers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the resulting conviction contending first that the State's suggestion on cross-examination that defendant had an FBI criminal record constituted prejudicial error. The court noted that an offer of evidence that was pertinent to a character trait of defendant was permissible under Mont. R. Evid. 404(a)(1). The key word being &quot;pertinent.&quot; Furthermore, cross-examination of a reputation witness was limited to that which was a relevant, specific instance of conduct, Mont. R. Evid. 405. Here no relevant trait of character was testified to, thus the discussion of the criminal record was improper. Furthermore, because the State's case against defendant rested on circumstantial evidence, its attempt to introduce discussion of the FBI criminal record was intended to impute guilt indirectly to defendant, and was not related to traits of character. Accordingly, the court held that defendant did not receive a fair trial, and the conviction was subject to reversal without discussion of his other alleged errors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant department of revenue, challenging the inclusion in gross income of interest from investments in federal obligations in determining their tax liability and challenging Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-114(2)(b)(ii)(C). The District Court of Lewis and Clark County, First Judicial District (Montana), granted the department's summary judgment motion, and the taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, federally chartered savings and loan associations doing business in Montana, filed Montana Corporation License Tax returns for the 1979 tax year. To arrive at the net income on which the tax was based, each taxpayer had deducted from its gross income the interest income received from its investments in federal obligations. Also, the first taxpayer deducted a net operating loss from prior years which was carried over to 1979. The department disallowed the interest income deduction and the net operating loss carryover deduction. In the taxpayers' declaratory judgment case, the trial court granted summary judgment to the department and held that the application of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-114(2)(b)(ii)(C) to the first taxpayer's net operating loss was valid. On appeal, the court held that under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1433, 1725(e), 2055, 2079, 2134 and 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742, 769, the interest income on the federal obligations was not includable in net income for purposes of calculating the Montana Corporation License Tax. The court also held that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-31-114(2)(b)(ii)(C) was unconstitutional because it required retroactive application and violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order denying the taxpayers' summary judgment motion and reversed the order granting the department's summary judgment motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the district court erred by making findings of fact and conclusions of law and imposing sentence on the basis of private-out-of-court information gathered by the presentence investigation officer where defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine the persons who supplied the information. Defendant claimed that he had the right to confront and cross-examine all witnesses who provided negative information to the sentencing judge. The court held that the right of cross-examination at a presentence hearing was a discretionary matter of the district court pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-113. Thus, there was no error where there was no showing that the district court abused its discretion. However, defendant still had a due process guarantee against a sentence predicated on misinformation. Defendant's guaranty of due process was protected in the instant case because he was represented by counsel at the time the sentencing information was made known to him, and he had the opportunity to rebut the information but chose to deny the accuracy of the information, presenting no evidence to support the alleged inaccuracies in the report.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to consecutive terms of 10 years imprisonment for negligent homicide and five years for the use of a weapon in committing that crime. On appeal, the court found that, contrary to defendant's assertion, the sentencing enhancement statute was not limited to violent crimes. There was also no conflict between the enhancement statute, which required a knowing mental state, and the negligent homicide statute. A person could have knowingly used a firearm and still have been negligent by grossly deviating from the conduct of a reasonable person in a similar situation with regard to the results of his actions. There was sufficient evidence to support the determination that defendant was subject to a &quot;certain amount of duress&quot; but it was not &quot;unusual or substantial.&quot; The facts indicated not unusual or substantial duress but rather a revengeful attitude on defendant's part. The requirement that the sentences run consecutively went to the equity of the sentence rather than to its legality, and such an inquiry was properly directed to a sentence review board.</SPAN></P>

Instead, the court reiterated that evidence obtained by a private citizen in violation of another's state constitutional rights was subject to the exclusionary rule and could not be admitted into evidence in a criminal trial in Montana. Accordingly, the court held that the search warrant was tainted because it was based on illegally obtained evidence. Lastly, the court held that the trial court erred by adopting the State's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, because the decision was not supported by the evidence or the law.</SPAN></P>

On the way home, he repeatedly hit her and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. As a result, defendant was convicted of second degree assault and rape. Defendant notified his attorney of his desire to appeal and was told an appeal was filed but was summarily dismissed without a hearing. After several years and several legal manipulations by defendant acting pro se, defendant filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his convictions. Defendant first argued that his rights to counsel, due process, and equal protection were violated by the court's failure to appoint counsel and properly hear his appeal. The court concluded that as an indigent person defendant had the right to counsel on appeal. Furthermore, the court system undermined his right to counsel by informally and summarily denying his appeal, as was evident from the record. Defendant also challenged the propriety of the jury instructions. The court concluded that the instructions, when taken as a whole, were erroneous in that they improperly shifted the burden to defendant. Therefore, defendant was denied a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the investigation of discrimination complaints made by certain municipal employees against the municipality, the HRC sought information regarding records related to other municipal employees. When the municipality refused to voluntarily provide the information, the HRC filed a petition in the district court to compel the production of the materials. The municipality argued that the information was personal, and releasing it without prior consent would violate the individuals' privacy rights. In dismissing the HRC's petition, the district court agreed with the municipality, and held that the disputed information was protected by Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 10, and that the HRC failed to show a compelling state interest in obtaining the information. On appeal by the HRC, the court vacated the district court's judgment. Although the district court had properly found that the information sought was protected by the Montana constitutional right to privacy, that right to privacy was not absolute. Under the circumstances, the court found that there was a compelling state interest to allow the HRC broad investigatory powers that outweighed the privacy interests of the individuals.</SPAN></P>

The bank moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, and only partially answered plaintiffs' interrogatories. The trial court granted the bank's motion, and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because the bank had no branches in Montana, and because the bank had not performed any action that would waive its jurisdictional privilege under 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 94, pursuant to &sect; 94 the trial court had no jurisdiction over the bank.

On the day of sentencing, the State filed its first written notice of intent to have defendant designated a persistent felony offender. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that the jury was properly permitted to infer that he intended to commit a theft by the fact that he was apprehended while unlawfully in a bar after it had closed. Further, the prosecutor did not unfairly prejudiced the jury against him by asking a witness, who was a lawyer, if he had ever defended defendant. However, the case was remanded for resentencing because the trial court was without jurisdiction to sentence defendant as a persistent felony offender. Under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-503, because defendant was convicted of the felony with which he had been charged, the State was required to file written notice of its intention to have defendant sentenced as a persistent felony offender, so defendant received at least three days notice before the sentencing hearing.

The state appealed but the court affirmed the judgment below, holding that under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 defendant had an expectation of privacy in his home. The court also ruled that the state failed to show a compelling state interest to violate his privacy. The officers had alternate methods of handling the traffic matter but chose to make a full arrest. The court concluded that defendant did not consent to the search voluntarily because his consent to the entry into his home was the result of subtle coercion by the police. The consent was not unequivocal, specific, or intelligently given. The officers did not have a right to be in the home; there was no prior justification for the intrusion.

The court held that Montana's compulsory automobile liability insurance statutes did not deprive defendant of due process of law because states were allowed to exercise their police powers to promote the health, welfare, and safety of the public. Use of the highways was subject to reasonable regulation for the public good. Thus, the state could constitutionally require the procurement of liability insurance or the deposit of security by owners of motor vehicles as a condition for licensing them. Furthermore, Montana's compulsory automobile liability insurance statutes did not deny defendant equal protection of the laws because the requirement that motorists carry automobile liability insurance clearly bore a rational relationship to the legitimate governmental interest of protecting persons using the public highways from financially irresponsible, negligent motorists. The statutes were reasonable regulations to carry out this objective.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and a bowling alley employee had conspired to kill defendant's wife and had hatched a plot to cover up the killing by making it appear as if a robbery of the bowling alley occurred. However, the employee received immunity and testified to the plot at defendant's trial. The court overturned the verdict because the trial court failed to define the elements of deliberate homicide in the instructions given to the jury. This was not harmless error, as argued by the State, because every material fact necessary to constitute a crime had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected defendant's contention that there was insufficient corroborative evidence to support the employee's testimony. Certain individuals testified to defendant's poor relationship with his wife. A handwriting expert testified that defendant probably signed for a locker that was taken out in someone else's name and used to hide the murder weapon. The trial court's instruction on the credibility of an immunized witness was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The teacher then filed an action against the university alleging that he was denied the position because of discrimination.

It also found no evidence had been presented which indicated the denial resulted from discrimination or that the procedures followed were intended to penalize a certain class. On review, the court agreed with the trial court's findings. Furthermore, the court found that while the denial of tenure would not benefit the teacher in looking for another job, the denial did not create such a stigma as to deprive him of a property interest. Furthermore, the mere fact that the teacher was eligible for tenure did not create a protected property interest in the tenured position.

Prior to that case, the son pleaded true to attempted arson. A dispositional hearing was held and he was placed in a boys home. The trial court determined there was no need for a dispositional hearing in the present case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testimony of the child indicated that he had been sexually abused by his father a couple of times a month since the age of five or six. The boy's mother and a social worker also testified about sexual abuse of the son that the father had discussed with them. The father argued that his wife should not have been allowed to testify about her husband's sexual abuse of their son. The court held that she could because the spousal privilege protected the sanctity of the marriage and home and once a family member had been sexually abused, the sanctity of the home and the reason for the rule was destroyed. The father argued that because he was found unfit to proceed in a collateral criminal case he was not competent to proceed in the present case. There was nothing in the record to indicate that the father was declared unfit to proceed in anything except the criminal proceeding. Therefore, it was proper to proceed with the youth in need of care proceeding despite the fact that the father was declared unfit to proceed in a collateral criminal action. The court held that failure to hold a dispositional hearing was harmless because the youth was already removed to the home until he was 18.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the owners and found that the ordinance was (1) invalid because it was enacted in violation of Montana laws governing zoning, and (2) unconstitutionally exclusive because it restricted mobile home parks to an impermissibly small percentage of the area zoned. On appeal, the city argued that because it relied upon a properly-enacted comprehensive plan for the entire jurisdictional area of the planning board, the ordinance was valid. The court agreed, holding that the jurisdictional area referred to in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-201 was that of the planning board and not that of the governmental entity. The city also contended that the district court erred in concluding that the ordinance had an unconstitutionally exclusionary effect upon mobile home parks. The court reversed the judgment and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. The court stated that there were issues of material fact concerning whether the ordinance was unlawfully exclusionary in that the standards referred to in the ordinance effectively excluded mobile homes from certain areas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted by a justice of the peace of operating a store without a valid retail license. Petitioner was then fined and, because he failed to pay the fine, sentenced to jail. Petitioner was later granted a writ of habeas corpus as the fine imposed far exceeded the proper fine. The State appealed, asserting, among other things, that petitioner failed to properly perfect his appeal to the district court and that the district court did not have jurisdiction to grant a writ of certiorari. The court held that under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-17-311, in order to perfect an appeal, petitioner had to file a notice of appeal within 10 days after judgment and was responsible for transferring to the district court the entire record within 30 days after judgment, or the appeal would be dismissed. Here, although petitioner filed the necessary written notice, he did not have the court records transferred to the district court within 30 days or within a 45-day extension. Thus, petitioner waived his appeal by failing to perfect it. Further, all three elements necessary for the proper granting of a writ of certiorari under Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a court-appointed attorney, appealed from a decision of the District Court of Cascade County (Montana), which denied his motion to waive its local rule setting forth the maximum amount in attorney fees to be awarded to court-appointed attorneys for representing indigent criminal defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was appointed by the district court to represent defendant, who had been charged with three felonies: aggravated assault, robbery, and felony theft. Following trial, the court-appointed attorney sought compensation by submitting an affidavit itemizing his work hours and expenses. The district court denied his request, pursuant to Rule 45 of the Eighth Judicial District Court, and limited his compensation to $ 1,000 for attorney fees plus $ 31.98 for expenses. On the attorney's motion to reconsider its order, the district court reaffirmed its earlier order, and the attorney appealed. On appeal, the court stated that a court-appointed attorney was required to be compensated by an amount that would allow the financial survival of his practice and that the $ 1,000 maximum did not amount to &quot;reasonable compensation,&quot; which was mandated by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-8-201. Applying the Allies rule, the court held that the district court abused its discretion in limiting the attorney's compensation because the affidavit from the attorney's accountant showed that his overhead costs alone exceeded the $ 1,000 award, leaving nothing to be applied toward his own support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's decision and remanded for a reconsideration and redetermination of the award of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The woman believed that she was retained as a photographer. Affirming, the court held that the evidence of the events occurring outside the State of Montana were properly admitted by the trial court because they were relevant to show the mental state or purpose of defendant. The court held that the statute defining the offense of solicitation, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-4-101 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the statute used the word &quot;facilitate,&quot; which was a commonly understood word and, therefore, not too vague. The court found that defendant must have had the purpose of promoting the commission of the offense. The court held that the statute was definite and specific enough to give fair warning of the conduct prohibited. Further, the court ruled that it was no defense to a charge of solicitation that the solicitee was unaware of the criminal nature of the conduct solicited or of defendant's purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district challenged a judgment from the District Court of Deer Lodge County (Montana), which awarded respondent principal backpay after she was terminated under the mandatory retirement provision of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 20-4-203(2), which the district court held was unconstitutional and had been impliedly repealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal was notified by the school district that as a result of her age her services would end in accordance with the mandatory retirement provision of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 20-4-203(2). When her appeal to the school district failed to change the decision to retire her, the principal filed a discrimination complaint with the Human Rights Commission. The commission determined that &sect; 20-4-203(2) was a statutory exception to the proscriptions against discrimination in the Human Rights Act, Mont. Code Ann. tit. 49. The commission found that no unlawful age discrimination had occurred. The principal then filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the school district. The district court denied injunctive relief, but declared that the mandatory retirement provision was unconstitutional and had been repealed by the adoption of Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-2-303(1) and 49-3-201. On appeal, the court affirmed that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 20-4-203(2) had been impliedly repealed. The mandatory retirement age was unrelated to job performance and was in violation of the Human Rights Act. The statutes were irreconcilably in conflict and the one later enacted worked a repeal of the former.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that the mandatory retirement provision had been impliedly repealed by the enactment of the Human Rights Act. The court reversed the trial court's award of backpay that failed to offset retirement benefits that the principal had received because of her forced retirement. The action was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction from the District Court of Flathead County, Eleventh Judicial District (Montana) for intimidation. He contended that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-203(1)(c) was unconstitutional, that the charge was not supported by the evidence, and that the trial court improperly instructed the jury, improperly admitted evidence of other crimes, and improperly admitted the testimony of a police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant followed the victim in his car as she was walking home from work. He pulled up behind her and propositioned her. He then continued following her and pulled up in front of her. This time he told her that he was going to rape her. She memorized the license plate on his car and reported the incident. He was charged with intimidation and convicted. On appeal, the court reviewed the constitutionality of the statute, specifically whether it proscribed protected conduct in such a manner as to be vague or overbroad. The court held that while it was possible that the statute could proscribe some protected conduct, the intrusion on such conduct was slight and could be dealt with when such cases arose. Because defendant was charged with conduct described as a commission of an offense against the person, and was a substantial evil, &sect; 45-5-203(1)(c) was not constitutionally infirm. Evidence of his other crimes, which were committed in a similar manner, was admissible. Further, while an officer's testimony that the license plate was on defendant's car was hearsay, ownership of the car was not pivotal in the prosecution and any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision of the District Court of Gallatin County, Eighteenth Judicial District (Montana), which declared Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404&nbsp;unconstitutional and which granted defendant's motion in limine to suppress all evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a breathalyzer sobriety test after he was arrested for driving while under the influence of intoxicants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol, he was taken to a police station and asked to submit to a breathalyzer test and to perform certain physical coordination exercises. Defendant performed the exercises but refused to submit to the test. The trial court granted defendant's motion in limine to suppress all evidence of his refusal to submit to the test as well as any evidence of license suspension resulting from that refusal. Although Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404(3) allowed a person to refuse a sobriety test, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404(2) allowed the refusal to be admitted into evidence. Under &sect; 61-8-404(2) defendant was compelled to choose between providing physical evidence against himself by submitted to the sobriety test and providing testimonial evidence against himself by refusing to submit to the test. The court held that such a requirement violated defendant's privilege against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. It was manifestly unfair to give defendant the right to refuse the test, and then to impose substantially the same penalty for refusing as that for submitting to the test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision suppressing the evidence of defendant's refusal to take the breathalyzer test, directed that at defendant's trial the State could not directly or indirectly submit evidence to the jury that defendant was offered but refused to take a breathalyzer test, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a regulated public utility offering services in Montana, filed an application for a rate increase with appellee, the branch of Montana's government charged with regulating public utilities.

Appellant objected to the data requests on the grounds that the information consisted of trade secrets and proprietary and confidential business information. Appellant offered to make the information available to appellee if a protective order was issued. Appellee denied the protection order on the basis that appellant, a corporation, was not entitled to the individual privacy exception under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. The court found appellant was entitled to protective relief because the trade secrets were property entitled to constitutional protection under Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Big Horn County (Montana) that denied its motion to dismiss the petition for post conviction relief that was filed by petitioner, an inmate sentenced to death (inmate). The inmate cross-appealed from the trial court's denial of his request for an evidentiary hearing on his post-conviction petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of deliberate homicide, aggravated kidnapping, robbery, and sentenced to death. Thereafter, the inmate filed a post-conviction relief petition. The state moved to dismiss, alleging that post-conviction relief, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-101 et seq., was not available to a defendant who had been sentenced to death. The trial court denied the state's motion, and refused to give the inmate an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial denial of the state's motion to dismiss, because it determined that if the state legislature intended that the post-conviction statutes applied only to defendants convicted of non-capital offenses, the legislature would have expressed that intent in the statute. However, the court reversed the trial court's determination relative to the inmate's request for an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as the inmate's allegations concerning that claim were sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Thus, the matter was remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court judgment that denied the state's motion to dismiss the inmate's petition for post conviction relief was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the State Bar of Montana, filed an action, within the court's original jurisdiction, against respondents, the Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana and the Attorney General of the State of Montana, seeking a declaration that Initiative 85, Mont. Code Ann. tit. 5 ch. 7, which governed lobbying activity, violated the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Bar contended that Initiative 85 violated the separation of powers doctrine in that it was an unlawful intrusion upon the court's power to govern the conduct of attorneys appearing before state and local government entities on behalf of clients. The State Bar also argued that &sect; 2(4)(b) of Initiative 85, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 5-7-102(4)(b), which defined &quot;nonlegislative lobbying,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The court denied the State Bar's request for declaratory relief, holding that when an attorney was seeking to influence a public official who was exercising a quasi-judicial function in a manner or field in which the public official had discretion, such an attorney was not engaged in lobbying under the terms of the Initiative. The court also found that the Initiative did not cover official activities of a purely ministerial nature. Accordingly, the court found that the Initiative, as construed, did not intrude upon the court's power to regulate the conduct of attorneys and that &sect; 2(4)(b) was not so vague as to be unconstitutionally uncertain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that Initiative 85 did not violate the state constitution in the manner alleged by the State Bar and it entered a declaratory judgment to that effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer, in his strict products liability action against defendant tire manufacturer, served requests for admission on the manufacturer and sought by deposition to orally examine the manufacturer's executives. The manufacturer filed a motion seeking protective order, which was granted by the District Court of Eighth Judicial District (Montana). The consumer petitioned for a writ of supervisory control.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the order of the circuit court prevented the consumer from using the documents in the consumer's possession for extra-judicial purposes as well as in the case at bar. Such an order had a chilling effect upon First Amendment rights and had to be subjected to close scrutiny. No findings had been made that justified the court order that counsel for the consumer were prohibited from making any further use whatsoever of such privileged documents and exhibits in the action. The court held that that portion of the circuit court's order unconstitutionally proscribed the consumer's freedom of expression and had to be reversed. The court found that the record was insufficient for it to make a determination of whether the manufacturer had waived any attorney-client or work product privileges concerning the documents the consumer sought. The court directed the circuit court to hold a hearing upon the waiver question. The court concluded that public policy militated in favor of permitting discovery of facts surrounding a recall campaign and an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) directed towards the manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's order that precluded the consumer from deposing the manufacturer's witnesses with respect to the NHTSA investigation and the recall campaign. The court remanded the matter to the district court for proceedings in conformity with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, plaintiffs, the Department of Revenue (DOR) and Department of Social Rehabilitative Services (SRS), sought review of a decision of the District Court, Cascade County (Montana), dismissing two paternity petitions and held that the statute of limitations on paternity determinations, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-108, had run. The State argued the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4 (1972).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State became an interested party after two unmarried mothers assigned their rights to support to SRS. Eight and three years, respectively, after their children's births, SRS filed petitions against defendants, the putative fathers, to establish paternity and seek reimbursement of public funds expended for the support of dependent children. The putative fathers' motions to dismiss were granted, based on SRS's failure to file within the three-year statute of limitations in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-108(3). On appeal, the court upheld the State's equal protection challenge to &sect;40-6-108(3), holding that it unfairly discriminated against children born out of wedlock by barring paternity actions filed more than three years after birth, a bar that was inapplicable to children of married parents. The State's interest in preventing fraudulent paternity claims was outweighed by children's need of support through their majority. However, the State's right to recover public monies paid to support out-of-wedlock children was subject to the three-year limitations period because putative fathers had the right to be protected from the State's inadvertence and delay in paternity actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the district court's opinion that had held that &sect; 40-6-108 was constitutional. The court affirmed the judgment of the district court that had held that &sect; 40-6-108 applied to the State in paternity actions.</SPAN></P>

The city and the department agreed that the relocation of the facilities was necessary and in the public interest, and the city granted the department the authority to relocate the facilities. However, the parties failed to agree on the proper allocation of relocation costs. The department filed a declaratory judgment action against the city to recover some of its relocation costs. The district court ordered that the city pay a portion of the costs. The city appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the city was required to pay a portion of the relocation costs pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 60-4-403. The court also found that the district court properly concluded that there was no taking in the constitutional sense when the department required the city to relocate its utilities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Fourteenth Judicial District, Musselshell County (Montana), declaring certain oil and gas leases owned by plaintiff lessee to be valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county had sold the property with a mineral reservation in the contract for deed. The actual deed contained a royalty reservation. The oil and gas lease allowed the county to claim it had a royalty interest. The trial court found that a mineral interest was more valuable than a royalty interest and that the deed by the county was an unconstitutional donation or gift by the county. The trial court further found that a prior judgment in a quiet title action could not be attacked and that such decree commanded the county to issue a mineral interest deed, which the county failed to do. The trial court further found that the prior decree was res judicata. The court disagreed and held the deed could not be reformed, as the lessee, by implication, had asked the trial court to do. The court held that the county owned a royalty interest in the lands involved and not a mineral interest and concluded that the oil and gas lease from the county to the lessee did not grant an effective lease upon a mineral interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Revenue challenged a judgment of the District Court of Lewis and Clark County, First Judicial District (Montana) in favor of respondent corporation in the corporation's action for a declaratory judgment that the two-year statute of limitations of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2-211 applied to the assessment of the corporate tax to the corporation that had failed to file a return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department determined that the corporation had been doing business in Montana for certain years and assessed a tax. The corporation contended that the two-year statute of limitations under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2-211 barred assessment. At issue was which of a succession of corporate tax assessment statutes remained in force during the times in question. The first statute was codified as Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2300 (1921), which applied to a corporation's neglect to file and was amended five times until 1963. Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2303.5 (1935) applied to corporations that did not file returns. Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 84-1505 (1945) was enacted, and an earlier opinion found that it superseded the 1935 statute because it was later in time. The prior limitations period of the 1935 statute was later re-enacted, and thereafter the whole statutory scheme was revamped. The net effect was that the 1945 statute was not repealed and the Department contended that its five-year limitations period applied. On appeal, the court held that absent express re-enactment, the statute was not applicable and the general limitations period of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2-211 barred assessment of the tax.</SPAN></P>

The costs claimed by the utility company should not have been deemed excessive, and the rate of return method should not have been applied. The court held that the utility company's earnings on its investment was not per se improper. It was only the earning of excessive, and thereby unreasonable, profits at the expense of the ratepayer which the PSC sought to prevent. As a matter of justice, it appeared that it might have been better for the PSC to use a marketplace cost of coal approach, if it could obtain sufficient facts for its determination, rather than using the rate of return method with all of its difficult theories and computations.</SPAN></P>

The district court decreed that I-85 was unconstitutional, null, and void, based upon I-85's impact on numerous rights: privacy, freedom of speech, press, and association, freedom to petition the government, equal protection of the laws, and freedom from compelled self-incrimination. The district court held that the State had not met its burden of establishing a compelling interest that justified the infringements. On appeal, the court agreed that various provisions of I-85 conflicted with some constitutional rights but held that there was a compelling State interest for the passage of I-85. The court held that while certain provisions were beyond redemption, the striking of those provisions did not result in a law that was incomplete or incapable of fulfilling its stated purpose and dissolved the injunction issued against defendants. The court held that those portions of I-85 which were declared void would have no further effect but that the remainder of I-85 was valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act was constitutional, except for one clause, Mont.

The court severed the defective clause from the Act.

The court affirmed and held that because of the unusual circumstances, the oral proclamation was not legally sufficient notice.

The charges arose when stolen skis were found in defendants' residence under a search warrant issued by the local justice of the peace. The owners of stolen skis had suspected that defendants were stealing skis. Defendants were tenants in a home listed for sale through a real-estate agency. On the pretense of being prospective buyers, the owners asked to be shown the house. During the tour, one of the owners reached under the bed, pulled out the stolen skis, and checked the serial number. The search warrant was based on the affidavit of the owners. The trial court held that the citizen search violated defendants' right of privacy. The State argued that defendants had waived their right to privacy by residing in a home that was listed for sale. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment, holding that the evidence was properly suppressed under the broad right to privacy in the state's constitution. The court held that when private citizens, acting on their own initiative, unreasonably invaded the privacy rights of individuals, the evidence thus obtained was subject to the exclusionary rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother, asserting in trial court that petitioner was the father of her minor child, moved to require him to submit to blood tests under Mont.

When petitioner failed to take the tests, he was placed in contempt. The court, on appeal, vacated the contempt order. The right to privacy was not absolute and could be regulated to further an interest to fix the parentage of a child. Moreover, court-ordered blood tests were &quot;searches&quot; and proscribed only if unreasonable. A state could legitimately order such tests where necessary to enforce a parental duty to support one's children. Here, the court said, the mere conclusory allegations of the mother were insufficient to satisfy the &quot;reasonableness&quot; requirement of federal and state constitutions. Only after a hearing established a prima facie case against the putative father could a blood test be ordered. Since the statutory procedures to establish reasonableness were not followed, petitioner's right to be secure from unreasonable searches was improperly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant building owners appealed a decision of the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, In and for the County of Yellowstone (Montana), which issued plaintiff neighbor a preliminary injunction under Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbor alleged that operation of the building as an apartment triplex by the building owners violated restrictive covenants to which the property was subject. The building owners contended that the trial court erred in granting a preliminary injunction under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-19-201. The court dissolved the injunction and remanded the case for trial. The court found that evidence presented by the building owners of acquiescence by the neighborhood in violations of the restrictive covenants rebutted the neighbor's prima facie showing that the restrictions were being violated. The court concluded that the prima facie case was rebutted, that the status quo would not be preserved, and that the injury to all would not be minimized. The court held that issuance of the preliminary injunction was a manifest abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff outfitter challenged the judgment of the District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Gallatin (Montana), which granted summary judgment for defendant Montana State Fish &amp; Game Commission and Montana State Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (department) in the outfitter's action challenging the denial of an application to renew his fishing outfitter's license under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-4-126.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1980, the department denied the outfitter's application for renewal on the grounds that he no longer met the residency requirements of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-4-126. From 1972 through 1978 the outfitter was a resident of Idaho and was a duly licensed nonresident fishing guide. At least a portion of his commercial guide business involved guiding fishing trips into several Montana counties. In 1978, the outfitter moved his residence from Idaho to Utah, but he continued to operate his outfitting business out of Idaho. In 1979, the outfitter was granted a renewal of his nonresident Montana outfitter's license. However, in 1980 it was denied. When the trial court affirmed the department's decision to deny the application, the outfitter appealed, challenging the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 87-4-122 and 87-4-126. The court reversed, remanded, and held that the outfitter was denied the equal protection of the law by the operation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 87-4-122(2) and 87-4-126. As such, the court ruled that &sect;&sect; 87-4-122(2) and 87-4-126 were unconstitutional because the department failed to offer any reasonable justification for its discrimination of nonresidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the department in the outfitter's action, challenging the denial of an application to renew his fishing outfitter's license, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court overruled its precedent in Dier v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for aiding and abetting another in tampering with a witness and aggravated assault were reversed because Mont.

Defendant moved for an order discharging him from prison, and the court ordered him released and bound over for rearraignment on the original information. Defendant argued that his second trial violated his right against double jeopardy, his due process rights, and his right to a speedy trial. Defendant's arguments were based on the fact that the reversal of his first convictions did not specifically order a new trial. The court held: (1) a failure to specifically order a new trial did not preclude a second trial; (2) a reversal of a conviction and an order for a retrial did not constitute double jeopardy; (3) a new trial was granted by the order that reversed defendant's first convictions; (4) defendant's due process and speedy trial rights were not violated by his second trial; and (5) the court's action were beyond the parameters of Mont.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;We need not address the merits of this issue.  The word &quot;poker&quot;, which Palmer is here attacking as unconstitutionally vague, is of ancient and common understanding.  Palmer is apparently knowledgeable of the meaning of Poker, at least to the extent that blackjack is not encompassed within that meaning.  At no time has Palmer contended the blackjack game he conducted at the Alta Saloon was a variation of poker.  Palmer's counsel admitted at oral argument that Palmer and others in his position in fact realize that blackjack definitely is not a variation of poker.  Since Palmer was neither inured nor jeopardized by the alleged vagueness of the word &quot;poker&quot;, hence by the operation of the statute, he lacks standing to challenge its constitutionality on that basis.  State v. kirkland (1979), &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mont. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 602 P.2d 586, 590, 36 St.Rep. 1963, 1966; State v. McFarlan (1927), 78 Mont. 156, 252 P. 805. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged the saloon operator with conducting an unauthorized card game, specifically a blackjack game, in violation of the Card Games Act, Mont.

The State stayed any further prosecution proceedings so that the saloon operator could file a declaratory action to determine the constitutionality of the &sect; 23-5-311. The trial court declared &sect; 23-5-311 constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 23-5-311 did not unconstitutionally deny equal protection of the laws because it applied uniformly across-the-board to all persons within Montana. The court further held that &sect; 23-5-311 was not special legislation which discriminated against blackjack and those gamblers who preferred to play blackjack. Finally, the court held that &sect; 23-5-311 was not void for vagueness because the word &quot;poker&quot; as used in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that, in any event, the saloon operator was not injured by the alleged vagueness of the word &quot;poker&quot; because he was charged with conducting the unauthorized game of black jack.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to the death penalty as well as various terms of incarceration. On appeal, defendant raised a number of contentions including, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial after a prosecution witness flashed certain photographs which were not admitted as evidence before the jury. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to declare a mistrial because there was no evidence of prejudicial error from such a brief exposure to the small photos from a distance. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the underlying felonies of kidnapping and robbery merged into the charge of felony murder. Defendant apparently was sentenced to death by hanging for the kidnapping charge. The court held that it was not a violation of the doctrine of double jeopardy to try and convict defendant on the homicide charge as well as the underlying felonies. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting and sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his involuntary commitment by the District Court for Yellowstone County (Montana). The issues were whether the trial court erred in using reasonable medical certainty as the legal standard of persuasion necessary to find appellant seriously mentally ill, whether Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-21-126(2) lowered the legal standard of persuasion required in civil commitment proceedings, and whether the issues were reviewable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although appellant had been released from commitment and had failed to raise the issues on appeal in the trial court, the court nonetheless reviewed the case as it presented important constitutional questions. The court found the statutory legal standard for proving serious mental illness was constitutional, but it reversed and dismissed the order because the trial court erred by using the standard for judging the competence of a medical witness' testimony in place of the required legal standard of persuasion for determining whether appellant was seriously mentally ill. Appellant was not shown to be seriously mentally ill by the required legal standard of persuasion of clear and convincing proof. Although Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-21-126(2) was constitutional, the legal standard of persuasion it required was far from satisfied by the evidence produced in appellant 's commitment proceeding because a person of unknown expertise was the sole witness produced to prove the mental disorder of appellant and the testimony given by this person was substantially insufficient with reasonable medical certainly to prove legally that appellant was seriously mentally ill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court involuntarily committing the individual to the state mental hospital was reversed and the case was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was injured when a practice grenade exploded while the minor was playing in a field used as a small arms firing range by a national guard unit. Upon granting partial summary judgment to the state, the trial court entered a final judgment in favor of the state against the guardian's claims for noneconomic damages. The guardian contended that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-104, which prohibited an award of noneconomic damages against the state, violated the prohibition of state immunity in Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 (amended 1974). The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the trial court. The court first determined that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-104 did not violate the Montana constitution because it did not make a governmental unit immune from tort action, but merely limited the state's liability to economic damages and other damages. The court then held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the state because &sect; 2-9-104 permitted the guardian to petition the governmental unit for economic damages in excess of $ 300,000 or other damages only after she had obtained a final judgment on her underlying action against the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board created two planning and zoning districts allowing for subdivision development and amended one to provide for greater density. The environmental organizations sought injunctive relief arguing that the zoning decision was not authorized since a comprehensive plan for the jurisdiction under Mont.

The court affirmed, holding that the planning and zoning districts were valid. Pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-101 greater than 60 percent of the landowners petitioned the board to create the districts, and the board did so in accordance with the other provisions of the law. Further, the court held that the board was authorized to make the decision without benefit of a county-wide plan because the provisions of the board's authority were separate and independent of the provisions regarding county-wide plans. The court also held that the decision to re-zone the property was not subject to the criteria set forth in other provisions because Mont.

It appears clear to us from the wording of the statute itself, as well as from the expressed purposes of the UPC, that the drafters intended that the surviving spouse should take a fee interest in the homestead allowance and exempt property.  By surviving the decedent for 120 hours, Celia Merkel and her estate became entitled to those benefits absolutely.

Respondent, the personal representative of the husband's estate, moved to dismiss the petition, asserting that the wife's failure to survive extinguished her claims, and that her estate had no valid claims. The court affirmed the denial of the elective share, holding that Mont.

The court reversed the judgment regarding the homestead allowance and exempt property allowance, holding that &sect;&sect; 72-2801 and 72-2-802, giving these rights to a surviving spouse, contemplated an interest which did not terminate at the surviving spouse's death, so long as the spouse survived the decedent for the required 120 hours.</SPAN></P>

There was no substance to the contentions that the objects to be seized and the premises to be searched were not sufficiently identified. Therefore, the motions to suppress the evidence acquired thereunder were properly denied by the trial court. Further, incriminating evidence that was seized in an inventory search of defendant was admissible because it was seized incident to a lawful arrest under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-5-101. In addition, a fourth search warrant authorizing the seizure of pubic hairs from defendant did not violate his right against self-incrimination or his due process rights. Probable cause had been established because the affidavit set out sufficient facts to support the evidentiary value of the pubic hairs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The shopper and a friend went to the store. While at the store, her friend shoplifted numerous items.

She brought an action against defendants for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The district court dismissed the malicious prosecution charge and submitted the false arrest charge to the jury, which found for the defendants. The shopper appealed. The court reversed and held that (1) the conviction of the shopper by the police court although later reversed, conclusively established the existence of probable cause, and the establishment of probable cause defeated an action for malicious prosecution; (2) admission of her friend's record as a shoplifter was error and it prejudiced the shopper's case; (3) Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-6-503, insofar as it permitted a merchant to stop and temporarily detain an individual suspected of shoplifting for up to thirty minutes without making an arrest, was unconstitutional as an invasion of the right to privacy guaranteed by Mont.

The court found that district judges did not deprive the inmates of a right when they decided that the inmates should have been imprisoned with no possibility of parole or participation in the furlough program.

The court stated that district court properly found that defendant was in a condition that rendered him incapable of refusing to consent to the taking of the blood sample when the sample was taken. The court reaffirmed its decision that Montana's implied consent statute did not contain an absolute arrest requirement before a blood sample could have been taken from an unconscious or otherwise incapable person and held that the blood test results were admissible under Montana's simplified consent statute. The district court did not err in admitting the results into evidence. The court found that defendant did not demonstrate any of the kinds of prejudice necessary to require the district court to order separate trials on the charges contained in the information. Hence, the district court did not err in failing to grant defendant's motion to sever. Thus, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 46-11-403(1), which permitted an information to be amended once as to substance up until five days prior to trial without leave of court, did not materially interfere with defendant's rights to a fair trial where the crimes charged in the informations both could lead to the same punishment, where both theories were placed before the jury, where defendant received every procedural consideration concerning notice and arraignment, and where he was afforded sufficient time to prepare his defense against the amended information. The court also held that, although there were inaccurate entries on the &quot;rap&quot; sheet attached to the presentence report, the improper information was disclosed and discussed so as to alert the sentencing judge to the inaccuracies, and the trial judge relied only on convictions and facts known to be true accounts of defendant's criminal record.</SPAN></P>

Another respondent, the unsuccessful bidder on the lease, challenged the trial court's decision to reopen the bidding on the lease rather than awarding it to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee held a surface lease to land owned by the state. Before the lease expired, he applied to renew the lease. The bidder applied to lease the land at a higher rate. The lessee was notified of the bid and informed that, as current lessee, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-6-205(1) allowed him a preferential right to meet the bid. He did so. He also was granted a hearing to determine if the bid was in the State's best interest. During the course of that proceeding it was determined that he had subleased the land without filing the sublease with the state. Although the State cancelled the lease for that failure, the lessee was allowed to reinstate the lease upon payment of a penalty. On appeal, the court relied on precedent that held that a lessee who did not use the land had no preferential right to renew the lease. The precedent was not distinguishable based on the fact that it arose in the context of a grazing district rather than an individual lessee. However, the lessee had a good faith belief that he was entitled to a preference. Therefore, it would be inequitable to award the lease to the bidder without giving the lessee an equal opportunity to bid on the lease.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment of the District Court. The lease was ordered canceled and reopened for bidding by all parties.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the district court, except with respect to the amount of filing fees. The court noted that the primary purpose of &sect; 82-1-305 was the protection of property of unlocatable owners of mineral interests. The court determined that the classification of persons holding unclaimed property had a rational relation to the purpose of the statute, and that the state had a legitimate interest in establishing a classification for the protection of unlocated owners of interests in minerals. The court found that &sect; 82-1-305 did not violate due process because its terms were not vague. The court concluded that the establishment of a trust pursuant to &sect; 82-1-305 was a &quot;special proceeding&quot; and that the company was therefore entitled to pay a lower filing fee than it had paid.</SPAN></P>

After admission to probate, the administratrix petitioned the court for an order construing the will. She challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 91-142, the mortmain statute. All interested parties, along with the attorney general, were notified and the trial court distributed the bequests to the beneficiaries. The trial court then ordered application of the law at the time of decedent's death, Mont. Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 91-142. On appeal, the court held that the statute was arbitrary because it validated a bequest made 30 days prior to death and invalidated a bequest made less than 30 days prior to death, which was an equal protection violation. The statute swept within its prohibition many testamentary gifts that did not threaten the evils sought to be eliminated, namely property coming into the hands of charitable organizations, along with the existence of improper influence.</SPAN></P>

If the tax were found to be invalid, the state would have to refund $ 87 million plus interest. The producers and utilities claimed the tax violated the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause. The court affirmed the judgments of dismissal. The court found that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause because the severance of coal by mining was not an interstate activity and because, under the Complete Auto Transit test, the tax applied to an activity with a substantial nexus to the state, was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to the services the state provided. The court held that the Supremacy Clause did not prohibit the rate of the tax or its imposition in general because the federal government had not preempted the field, the tax did not conflict with a national policy derived from acts of Congress, and the tax did not distort any compromise between the federal government and the states as expressed in the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 181 et seq., which specifically allowed state taxation, 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 189.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mining company sought review of separate judgments of the District Court of Silver Bow County, Second Judicial District (Montana), which enjoined expansion of its mining activity in violation of residential subdivision restrictive covenants, refused to stay the injunction pending appeal, and, in the company's condemnation action, found that acquisition of respondent lot owners' property was necessary for mining operations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the trial court erred in refusing to stay its injunction pending resolution of the condemnation action and erred in refusing judgment of condemnation. In reversing, the court ruled that restrictive covenants were merely part of the fee subject to taking by eminent domain and that the injunction should have been stayed pending determination of whether the company's taking was lawful. The court further ruled that mining, except coal strip mining, was an authorized public use within Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 70-30-102(15), but that condemnation was required by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 70-30-110 to be compatible with the greatest public good and least private injury. The court found that the company had considered all alternatives before determining the necessity of taking the lot owners' property. The court ruled that such determination by the company was given great weight because of its expertise and was not overturned in the absence of clear and convincing proof to the contrary. Finally, the court rejected the argument that the exclusion of coal strip mining as a public purpose violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted defendant of four counts of failing to make or render an income tax return, and defendant sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error in one of its instructions to the jury. The court found that the trial court delivered an instruction to the jury that could have led the jury to believe that the state did not have to carry its full burden of proof to establish its case against defendant.

Based on evidence allegedly found as a result of a polygraph examination and a search, the district court revoked defendant's 10-year suspended sentence and ordered him to prison. On review, the court vacated the order. In reaching its decision, the court ruled that both provisions constituted invalid conditions of probation. With regard to the unlimited warrantless search provision, the court ruled that the provision violated defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend.

The court reversed the convictions and dismissed the amended information, concluding that art.

This required that the district court review each stage of the proceeding by information, including amendments to the information, that was initiated against defendant. As such, the provision under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-11-403(1) for amendments without leave of court unconstitutionally conflicted with Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 20.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1973, a city adopted a zoning ordinance based upon land use designations in its comprehensive plan. The ordinance included a multiple-family residential (RM) designation. In 1977, the city was merged into a new governmental unit. The successor city acquired all the former city's legislation, including the zoning ordinance. In 1978, the owner purchased property in a RM district intending to relocate his bar. The board denied his variance request. The district court affirmed the board's denial. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional as a valid exercise of police power. Further, the ordinance had not been applied in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner. Moreover, the former city acted within its delegated authority in enacting the ordinance by complying with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-301 and Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-304. Finally, the board and the district court were fully justified in finding that the granting of the requested variance would not be in the public interest.

Code Ann. &sect; 69-4-603 declared unconstitutional. Plaintiffs argued that the statute provided for an unconstitutional taking of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the statute unconstitutionally required them to pay the costs of moving or cutting power lines for defendant companies when they moved buildings or large equipment over roadways. The lower court struck an amendment to the statute as making an impermissible differentiation between inside and outside the city limits when determining costs plaintiffs could charge for moving lines. The lower court held that the power companies were to pay all the costs in every situation. The court affirmed and held that the statute was an exercise in police power, not eminent domain. The exercise of police power was aimed at protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. The statute did not involve the appropriation of a property right because by the location of plaintiffs' facilities upon a public right of way plaintiffs were conferred a property right which was subject to other competing franchises and privileges. Plaintiffs had no right to occupy a particular location. Although the wires would be temporarily raised or cut, that in no way constituted a taking and plaintiffs' property was not condemned in any sense.</SPAN></P>

The court automatically reviewed death sentence cases and addressed defendant's contentions of error. Defendant's first conviction was reversed. At his second trial, he was again found guilty and was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the district court did not err in permitting a witness to repeat statements allegedly made by a co-conspirator on the night of the crime for purposes of impeachment. The court explained that, despite the fact that the co-conspirator's prior statements were not under oath, the witness' testimony was not hearsay because the co-conspirator testified and was cross-examined at trial concerning his inconsistent statements. The court found that although admission of the sheriff's opinion testimony at trial was not proper, it did not affect substantial rights of defendant. The court found that the trial court properly admitted a shell casing taken from another defendant's vehicle weeks after the murder and that it properly denied defendant's motion for acquittal due to insufficiency of evidence. The court affirmed defendant's death sentence even though it was more severe than the sentence imposed after the first trial, explaining that vindictiveness was not an issue because the second trial had a different judge and he clearly stated his reasons for imposing the death penalty. The amended death penalty statute for aggravated kidnapping was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured on the job and was awarded workers' compensation disability benefits. The fund terminated the employee's benefits pursuant to Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 92-702.1 (1947) after the employee applied for and received Social Security disability benefits. The lower court found &sect; 92-702.1 to be unconstitutional and applied the amended statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-702, to offset only 50 percent of the employee's workers' compensation benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed in part. The court found that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-702 was effective and that it covered federal disability insurance benefits. Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 92-702.1, however, was constitutionally unenforceable because it was in opposition to federal legislation and did not give a liberal construction to the Montana Workers' Compensation Act. Moreover, Montana's offset statute should not have been applied to cost-of-living increases in the employee's Social Security disability benefits. The Montana offset statute was not an unconstitutional denial of equal protection. It did not violate Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4 (1972) by discriminating against the employee on the basis of his social condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision to partially reinstate the employee's workers' compensation disability benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery for his role in a group robbery and murder of a grocery store employee. Defendant asserted that his conviction was improper because his double jeopardy rights had been violated and the juries' verdicts against the various defendants had been inconsistent. The court affirmed. The court held that a defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy by virtue of his retrial after reversal of his judgment of conviction. Furthermore, the court was not inclined to reverse convictions in criminal cases merely upon the ground of inconsistency of verdicts reached by a jury as to defendant who had been charged in several counts. The court held that defendant was an accomplice. An accomplice was legally defined as one who knowingly, voluntarily, and with common intent with a principal offender united in the commission of a crime. There was sufficient credible evidence linking defendant to the crimes, and thus, he was properly convicted in the robbery of the store employee.</SPAN></P>

The court held that any error was harmless. Next, defendant asserted that the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was capable of forming the requisite intent. The factual issue of intoxication was to be determined by a jury. The court determined that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the jury's finding of guilt. Defendant also contended that the district court erred with regard to the jury instructions given, but the court disagreed and concluded that no objection was made to the instruction during the trial, and the plain error standard of review would not be applied.

After he was later given sodium amytal, he confessed to the homicide, and provided information regarding the murder weapon. Defendant was convicted of mitigated deliberate homicide, and he appealed. The court reversed and remanded the action for a new trial, holding that defendant's confession was involuntary and that the trial court erred in not suppressing his confession and the weapon as the fruit of the poisonous tree. Factors considered by the court included keeping defendant incommunicado, isolating him in a hostile environment, using the guilt assumption technique of interrogation, and using sodium amytal. Because the confession was involuntary, the weapon should have been suppressed as evidence gained from a constitutional violation. Further, the trial court erred in admitting photographs of the victims because the prejudice was great and the probative value was small. Because the conviction was reversed, but defendant was a danger to the community, the court directed that defendant be evaluated and taken into custody pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-21-129.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that a jury instruction given at his trial was similar to the Sandstrom instruction that was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The court disagreed. The jury had been instructed that it could resort to inference to determine subjective matters such as knowledge or purpose. The Sandstrom instruction was by its terms mandatory, while the instruction given at defendant's trial was permissive. The court found that the instruction did not stand alone on the burden of proof and the jury was informed that the State was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, all material facts alleged in the information. Thus, the instruction did not have the effect of allocating to defendant some part of the burden of proof that properly rested on the State. The court also held that the instruction on &quot;knowingly&quot; did not make it mandatory upon the jury to find defendant's awareness. The instruction did not establish a presumption which testimony could not overthrow; thus, the trial court did not invade the fact-finding duty of the jury. Finally, the court rejected defendant's contentions that the new Montana capital punishment statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held first that because defendant had notice and a fair opportunity to raise a specific objection to the State's failure to identify him as the person named in the certificate of prior conviction, he could not make that assertion for the first time on appeal. As to defendant's second assertion, the trial court held a hearing to determine if aggravating or mitigating factors were present. It found that none of the mitigating circumstances stated in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-222 applied. The court's findings of fact indicated that it considered defendant's drinking and sexual problems but concluded that those conditions did not excuse defendant from accountability for his acts.

Shortly thereafter, police questioned him on four occasions, each time first advising him of his rights. He contended that a confession that he gave should have been suppressed by the trial court because it was not voluntarily given and, further, that there was insufficient evidence supporting the verdict. Affirming, the court found the decision of the trial court that defendant had voluntarily confessed did not clearly contravene the weight of the evidence. In addition, the court concluded that defendant's statement that &quot;maybe I should have an attorney&quot; effectively asserted his right to counsel under Miranda and that the trial court erred in finding to the contrary. However, defendant subsequently waived his right to counsel under the circumstances presented.

The court reasoned that the principles of eminent domain applied because Mont.

The court also held that the property owner showed that the relocation was needed to allow for the installation of an irrigation system, which the court recognized as a public use even though the property owner was going to profit from the system's installation. The court further declared that Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association argued that the trial court erred because the dual regulatory system for plumbers, which consisted of both state and local regulation, was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection and due process. Specifically, the association argued that the double regulation of the plumbers was an invalid exercise of police power, denied them equal protection of the law, and violated due process requirements. The court disagreed with the association's position. The state regulatory system was aimed at the protection of the health and welfare of the people of Montana, which constituted an exercise of the state's police power. Further, dual regulation of an activity by a municipality and the State was not prohibited as long as the municipal regulation did not conflict with the state regulation. The court found that the State had consented to local regulation of plumbers under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 50-60-201 et seq. The dual regulation did not violate equal protection because all plumbers subject to both the local ordinance and the state statute were treated alike. Any classification created by the local ordinance bore a rational relationship to the public health.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received several death threats on his life. He claimed that he met with the victim for help and that his gun accidentally discharged. The victim stated that defendant shot him in the chest without conversation. Defendant was charged with attempted deliberate homicide, but the jury found him guilty of the lesser included offense of aggravated assault. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's challenges relating to the death penalty because he had no standing to raise the issue where he had not been convicted of a crime that carried a death sentence. Defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's denial of his motion for a continuance. Defendant complained that he was denied a fair trial because of news releases before and during the trial that suggested he was a hired killer. The court was not persuaded to adopt a rule requiring the trial court to question each juror to determine awareness of the publicity. Instead, such matters were left to the discretion of the trial court, subject to the court's review. The jurors were admonished not to read or listen to reports of the trial, and defendant failed to show that any juror had been exposed to the news releases.</SPAN></P>

The act and intent of defendant were both proved beyond a reasonable doubt as defendant chose to perform a manipulation that the jury found to be specific and prohibited to all except licensed chiropractors. Finally, defendant was not subject to double jeopardy because he was convicted of two counts of practicing chiropractic without a license involving the treatment of two different patients of different occasions. Neither of the offenses included the other and thus, defendant did not suffer a dual conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that, although ordinarily review before the appeal board was required before challenging department decisions in court, such was not the case where the taxpayers had not participated in, or been parties to, the department proceedings or where the department's action was done under &quot;fundamentally wrong principles of appraisal.&quot; The court found that the taxpayers had not participated in the proceeding before the department and that they alleged that the department, in denying them favorable MELDA treatment, applied a fundamentally wrong principle of appraisal, which was a question of law that was not required to be raised in an appeal before the tax appeal board.</SPAN></P>

The Department approved one of the mergers. Respondent opponents appealed the Department's decision. The trial court found that &sect; 7-133.2 contained an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Department by reasons of a lack of statutory standards to guide its discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sentenced to death for aggravated kidnapping. In his first appeal, the court determined that the statute under which he was sentenced was unconstitutional. On remand, the district court applied new sentencing statutes and again assessed the death penalty. The court held that he was not placed twice in jeopardy for his aggravated kidnapping conviction in light of his conviction of deliberate homicide because each offense required the proof of an element that was not required for the other. For the same reason the aggravated kidnapping was not a lesser-included offense. The district court's application of 1977 statutes in sentencing him for a crime he committed in 1974 did not violate constitutional ex post facto provisions because the latter statute affected only the manner in which the death penalty was to be determined and was less onerous. The statutes were not unconstitutional because they allowed the imposition of death only upon a finding of an aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances. The sentence was not excessive or disproportionate compared to the penalty imposed in similar cases or compared to the sentences received by his accomplice.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed a four-part test for determining if there was a deprivation of the right to a speedy trial, and held that the trial was speedy enough given the complexity of the case. The court rejected the argument that pretrial publicity prejudiced defendant, and found that there was substantial evidence to support the judgment. The court also rejected the challenge to the sentence and held that the opportunity to have a portion of the sentence suspended upon payment of restitution was not cruel and unusual punishment, but a proper condition for suspension in this type of case. The court found that the judge properly exercised discretion in making rulings on admissibility of evidence and the propriety of allowing witness testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the 18th Judicial District Court of Gallatin County (Montana) that convicted him following a nonjury trial for deceptive practices, in violation of Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 94-6-307, now Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-6-317, and for the sale of unregistered securities in violation of &sect;&sect; 15-2007,15-2021 of the Securities Act of Montana, now Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-10-202, 30-10-306.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in part for the sale of unregistered securities in violation of &sect;&sect; 15-2007, 15-2021 of the Securities Act of Montana, now Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 30-10-202,30-10 -306. The security which defendant allegedly sold was a package sealer contract. The trial court found that the contracts were investment contracts under Montana law and therefore subject to registration requirements. The court affirmed after adopting a broadened definition of &quot;security&quot; in line with a vast weight of authority across the country. Montana had adopted the Uniform Securities Act, Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 15-2001 (1947), now Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-15-1901, which in turn relied for its definition on the Federal Securities Act. Caselaw established that the touchstone of an investment contract was the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. Under the this test, the sealer contracts, with their promise of profits to come from the entrepreneurial efforts of defendant and his employees, were clearly classifiable as investment contract securities and subject to regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to build a shopping mall outside the city, the corporation applied for the necessary conditional use permit. At the hearing on the corporation's application, the Commission resolved to impose a one-year moratorium on the granting of all conditional use permits for shopping malls outside the city. The corporation petitioned the court for a writ of mandate to require the Commission to rule on its application. The court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, because there were unresolved factual controversies. The corporation petitioned the trial court for a declaratory judgment and writ of mandate. The trial court ruled in favor of the corporation, and ordered the Commission to issue the conditional use permit. On appeal by defendants, the court reversed. The court held that although the city's police powers permitted it to issue moratoriums, this moratorium was void because it did not follow the procedures set forth in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-306. While the trial court could compel the Commission to rule upon the permit, ordering the Commission to grant the permit erroneously usurped the Commission's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party filed an action against defendants arising from injuries he allegedly sustained during a basketball game at the high school. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the injured party's argument that the statute of limitations on his action did not begin to run until he filed his claim for damages with defendants. The court explained that the provision in the Montana Tort Claims Act requiring a party to file a claim against a governmental unit with appropriate officials of the unit within 120 days had been struck down as unconstitutional and that the statute of limitations began to run when the action accrued. The court explained that to hold otherwise was to nullify the effect of the statute of limitations. The court concluded that the injured party's action was time-barred pursuant to the three-year statute of limitations against personal injury actions contained in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2-202 and the two-year statute of limitations applicable to claims against the state contained in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-301(2) because he filed it more than three years after the alleged injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the District Court of Lewis and Clark County, First Judicial District (Montana), which convicted him of attempted deliberate homicide following a jury trial. Defendant raised error in the admission and exclusion of evidence, the refusal to give defendant's proposed jury instructions, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the constitutionality of the statutes under which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the victim was shot during a struggle over a gun that defendant intended to use to intimidate a crowd and to give his companion a chance to escape a beating by the victim. Photographs of defendant's condition after the crowd beat him were properly excluded because they were not substantially necessary or instructive to show material facts or conditions. The probative value of testimony regarding the victim's wound to the heart outweighed any prejudicial effect, however, because it was relevant and probative to establishing intent to kill, an element of the crime of attempted deliberate homicide. Although defendant's requested instructions were correct statements of the law, the trial court did not err in refusing them where the elements of the instructions were incorporated in other instructions. The court concluded that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the attempt statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-4-103(3), on the ground that the maximum punishment for an attempt was the same as the maximum penalty for the principal offense of deliberate homicide because the provision of which he complained was not applied in his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contract between the hospitals and SRS for Medicaid reimbursement provided that SRS would reimburse the hospitals for &quot;reasonable costs&quot; in compliance with federal guidelines.

The hospitals' &quot;standard charges&quot; turned out to be less than the federal guidelines' &quot;reasonable costs,&quot; but SRS refused to grant the hospitals a supplemental allowance for the years 1968 through 1975. The trial court found for the hospitals, and on appeal, the court affirmed with a modification. The court held that the contract required reimbursement of &quot;reasonable costs&quot; under the federal guidelines even if the federal reasonable costs were more than the &quot;standard charges.&quot; The court modified, however, because under amendments to the federal guidelines in 42 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 405.455(a) and 450.30(a)(i), for the fiscal year 1975 payments were to be the lesser of reasonable cost or the customary charges made for the services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer sought review of a decision of the District Court of Fergus County, Tenth Judicial District (Montana), which granted summary judgment to plaintiff collection agency in its original debt action for trust fund payments allegedly due. The employer also challenged the trial court's award of attorney fees to the collection agency and its order dismissing the employer's complaint for wrongful attachment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collection agency claimed that the employer failed to make contributions that were due under a collective bargaining agreement. The court determined that the trial court erred in granting the collection agency summary judgment because there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the employer's son was an employee for whom contributions were due and regarding the amount of the contributions that were due, if any. The court also determined that the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees on the basis of an affidavit alone. An award of attorney fees had to be based on a hearing allowing for oral testimony, the introduction of exhibits, and an opportunity to cross-examine in which the reasonableness of the attorney fees claimed was demonstrated. The court found that the order dismissing the employer's complaint for wrongful attachment was erroneous. No appeal was taken from an order dissolving the collection agency's attachment, and the order became final when the appeal period elapsed. Therefore, the conditions of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-18-204 were satisfied, and the employer was entitled to pursue his claim for damages that resulted from the wrongful attachment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former policeman appealed from a decision of the District Court of Lewis and Clark County (Montana), which determined that he was not entitled to overtime compensation as a policeman of a third-class city. The issue on appeal was whether or not the district court properly determined that policemen of third-class cities were not entitled to overtime compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city admitted that it had not paid any overtime to the former policeman. On appeal, the court held that the Minimum Wages and Hours Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-401 et seq., had been held constitutional under the Billings rule, but policemen were bona fide professionals and were exempt from the Act. As a result of the Billings rule, no policemen in Montana were entitled to receive overtime compensation. In response, the legislature had amended the Police Act by passing Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-32-4119, entitling policemen in first- and second-class cities to overtime compensation; however, policemen employed by cities of the third class were not included in the amendment. The former policeman argued that omission of policemen of third-class cities from the statute was a mistake, which the court should correct. The court refused, stating that it was bound by the rules of statutory construction and was unable to rewrite the statute by judicially including policemen of third-class cities in the amendment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 81-405(1) (1947), now Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-6-205(1). The district exercised the preference right and thereafter leased the land to the previous user. On appeal, the issue was whether the Department's actions were constitutional under Mont. Const., art. X, &sect; 11(2) (1972) and Mont. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1 (1889). The court held that to allow the lessee county grazing district to exercise a preference right was an unconstitutional application of &sect; 77-6-205(1). To allow the district to exercise such a right put it in the role of trustee of the land, a duty of the Department, which was required to act as fiduciary to advance the policy of sustained yield.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 45-8-318, and aggravated assault. He appealed, asserting that the district court erred by not granting his motion for a directed verdict made on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction for possession of a weapon by a prisoner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an inmate, with whom defendant had fought before, showed defendant a sharpened file, defendant armed himself with a metal pipe. He hid it in his clothing and disregarded an order from a prison officer that he stop for a search. Defendant hit the inmate with the pipe. The court upheld the judgment below. The jury had been instructed that a &quot;billy,&quot; as used in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-8-318, was a club. The court held that the metal pipe wielded by defendant was clearly a club within the common understanding of that term. Next, the court noted that the record did not support the contention that the State failed to prove unauthorized possession of the pipe. Defendant's furtive conduct revealed that he knew he was exceeding lawful authority in possessing the pipe. Third, it was noted that the convictions did not violate prohibitions against double jeopardy because possession of a weapon by a prisoner included distinct elements that were not elements of aggravated assault. Finally, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-8-318 was not unconstitutionally vague and violative of due process because it made clear that possession of a club was an offense only if it was possession without authorization.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 84-206 (1947). The exemption was to apply to the taxpayers' irrigation systems.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were farmers or ranchers who utilized irrigation systems on their lands. A conflict arose among the ranchers, the Department, and tax assessors of the various counties over whether the irrigation systems were subject to the property tax. The taxpayers filed an action in the district court of one county and the counties agreed to be bound by the decision of that court. The district court held that the irrigation systems were exempt from the tax pursuant to &sect; 84-206 and enjoined the counties from collecting the tax. The Department appealed. The court, sua sponte, determined that at the time that &sect; 84-206 was enacted, the legislature was without authority to enact an exemption of the type argued for by the taxpayers by reason of the provision in Mont. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2. The constitutional provision then in effect provided that only the property specifically mentioned in a statute could be the subject of an exemption. The court rejected the taxpayers' argument that the later amendment of the constitution to remove that provision validated the exemption, stating that a statute void from inception could not be made valid without reenactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district courts exempting the taxpayers' irrigation systems from the personal property tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudged to be an habitual traffic offender. He appealed, asserting, among other things, that the complaint to have him declared to be an habitual offender was invalid on its face as the record indicated that he had not accumulated more than 30 conviction points for traffic violations. The court reversed the order. The court noted that defendant's driving record showed an abstract of court records in which one violation was recorded as failure to report an accident by the quickest means. No other information was given as to that charge, particularly the date, the place it occurred, the arresting officer, and whether there was bodily injury or death involved or property damage in the amount of $ 100 or more. The trial court assumed, without proof, that the conviction for failure to report by quickest means involved death, injury, or property damage. Without proof, however, there was insufficient record to substantiate the conviction for failure to report the accident by the quickest means, which reduced defendant's points to a total of 29. Under Mont. Rev. Code &sect; 31-177, 30 or more points were required before defendant could be considered an habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DHES initiated an action seeking to enjoin the commissioners from allowing open burning of yard and wood leavings without a permit in violation of a DHES rule requiring a permit for open burning activities. The trial court ordered a peremptory writ of prohibition, enjoined further violation of the open burning rule, and awarded the DHES attorney fees and costs. The commissioners appealed asserting that the DHES rule was ultra vires and the award of attorney fees improper. The court affirmed. It concluded that the legislature intended to give DHES the powers and authority to adopt the specific open burning rule under attack. It further held that the rule met the criteria for constitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative agency. Specifically, the legislature authorized the State Board of Health (board) to carry out the legislative intent of the Act, Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 69-3909(1), and the board had standards by which their power to adopt the rule was governed, Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 69-3913, 69-3911(1). The commissioners exceeded their jurisdiction in authorizing open burning without a permit. The award of attorney fees was also appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the newspaper's motion to dismiss the printer's complaint on the ground that the printer failed to demand a retraction before filing the action as required by &sect; 64-207.1. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court. The court held that &sect; 64-207.1 was unconstitutional because, by requiring the printer to demand a retraction from the newspaper as a prerequisite to his libel action, the statute violated the freedom of press and open courts provisions of the Montana Constitution, Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 7, 16. The court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions that in order to recover as a private person, the printer was required to prove: (1) that the published material was false; (2) that the newspaper was at fault in the publication; and (3) that actual injury to the printer ensued.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Sweet Grass County, Sixth Judicial District (Montana), which convicted him of burglary in violation of Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 94-6-204(1) (Smith 1947). He was sentenced to 50 years in the Montana State Prison as a persistent felony offender pursuant to Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 95-1507(1) (Smith 1947).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the burglary of a lumber company. Defendant asserted an alibi defense, contending that his codefendant was the sole perpetrator. The defense asserted that he was not in the area and could not have been there at the time of the burglary. A witness saw someone in the building on the night of the burglary who was later identified as defendant. On appeal, defendant raised numerous issues. The court rejected his argument that the eyewitness's testimony placing him inside the building on the night of the crime was &quot;inherently incredible.&quot; The court rejected his argument that the trial court should have given a lesser included offense instruction on criminal trespass. The court reasoned that no evidence was admitted that could have led a reasonable juror to believe that he was in the building, but for an innocent purpose. His several challenges to the persistent felony offender statutes were all rejected. However, the court held that the State failed to offer sufficient evidence of identity as to one prior convictions. The other was properly used even though it was pending on appeal at the time of sentencing. The court affirmed but remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and the judgment that defendant qualified as a persistent felony offender, and remanded for resentencing, because the court could not be certain that the trial court would have sentenced defendant to 50 years had it ruled that the State failed to prove defendant's identity with respect to one of the alleged prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In prior actions, defendants were charged with criminal possession of dangerous drugs. Both defendants agreed to a condition, one as a condition to probation and one as a condition to deferred prosecution, submitting themselves, their residences and their vehicles to search at any time by probation officers or other lawful authorities, without a search warrant and without the need to show probable cause. Thereafter, the police received a tip that defendants were involved in drug trafficking. Consequently, the police began surveillance, which revealed that people, who were known drug dealers, were continually coming to the residence. As such, the officers conducted a search of the residence under the warrantless search clause contained in the prior documents. The court affirmed the convictions and held that the state had probable cause to believe an offense was committed in defendants' residence and, because of the exigent circumstances, the officers were justified in entering and arresting defendants and searching them and the premises immediately under their control. The court also held that the search and arrest was reasonable under Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 95-702 (1947).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the District Court of Rosebud County, Sixteenth Judicial District (Montana), which convicted defendant of deliberate homicide, aggravated kidnapping, and sexual intercourse without consent, inflicting bodily injury. The district court denied defendant's motion for a new trial, sentencing him to imprisonment on counts one and three and to death on count two. A stay of execution had been granted pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised multiple points of alleged error on the part of the trial court, primarily in the admission of confessions, statements, and evidence allegedly illegally seized and involving conflicts between defendant's factual account of events and the account provided by an accomplice. Defendant's primary argument was that his death sentence could not stand because it was unconstitutional. Defendant raised two claims: (1) two jurors were excused for cause by the district court based on their views of capital punishment, in violation of a caselaw rule prohibiting such exclusion; and (2) Montana's death penalty statute under which defendant was sentenced, Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 94-5-304 (1947), was unconstitutional on its face. The court affirmed the judgment, vacated the sentences of death and imprisonment imposed for counts two and three, respectively, and remanded the case for resentencing. The court held that: (1) &sect; 94-5-304 was a mandatory death penalty statute; (2) in the light of recent United States Supreme Court decisions &sect; 94-5-304 was unconstitutional on its face under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments; and (3) therefore defendant's death sentence could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment convicting defendant of deliberate homicide, aggravated kidnapping, and sexual intercourse without consent, inflicting bodily injury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the District Court for Yellowstone County (Montana), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief after his guilty plea to a charge of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 94-8-210 (1947). The district court sentenced defendant to a 20-year prison term under Montana's persistent felony offender statute, Mont. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge, the district court deferred imposition of sentence. Defendant violated parole and was sentenced to state prison. Upon his subsequent parole, defendant was arrested and indicted on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 94-8-210 (1947). Defendant pleaded guilty to the weapons charge and was sentenced to a 20-year prison term under the persistent felony offender statute, Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 95-1507 (1947). The district court entered an order denying defendant's petition for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the order, holding that (1) &sect; 95-1507 did not violate constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws because it imposed a stiffened penalty for the latest crime of a repeat offender; (2) Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 94-8-210 (1947) did not violate defendant's right to equal protection because it gave the trial court power to classify the weapons offense as either a felony or misdemeanor, nor was it unconstitutionally vague; and (3) defendant's guilty plea was entered voluntarily and understandingly because he wasinformed of the maximum potential penalty for his crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual sought review of a decision from the District Court of Lewis and Clark County (Montana), which held, on cross-motions for summary judgment, that challenged legislation was valid and enforceable. The individual had brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that Chapter 533, Laws of 1975, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other things, the issues before the court were whether the use of the proceeds of bonds for loans to private individuals under the act violated art. V, &sect; 11 as an appropriation to a private individual not under control of the state, and whether Chapter 533, Laws of 1975 constituted an invalid delegation of legislative authority to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. The court held that there could be no doubt that Mont. Const. art. V, &sect; 11(5), prohibited the appropriation of funds for the use of any private individual, association, or corporation not under state control. The court held that the mandate of art. V, &sect; 11(5) was met. However, the court held that the only limit on the power to loan money for a certain project was the board of natural resources and conservation's subjective determination of whether a project was worthwhile. The court held that the parameters which defined a project eligible for the loans contemplated by the act had to be more clearly defined. The court held that insufficient guidelines were provided to the department of natural resources and conservation in order for it to fully know its rights and obligations under the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded the matter with instructions to declare those portions of the act, which provided for renewable resource development loans to farmers and ranchers, unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment, after a jury trial in the District Court of Lincoln County, Eleventh Judicial District (Montana), convicting him of operating a motor vehicle wrecking facility without a license, a misdemeanor, in violation of Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 69-6802 (Smith 1947). He asserted that the statute was an unconstitutional taking without due process, and that a prior conviction barred his prosecution on double jeopardy grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 69-6802 by operating a motor vehicle wrecking facility without a license. He appealed, urging that the statute unconstitutionally permitted a taking of property without due process, and that double jeopardy barred his second prosecution for violating the statute. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that there was no due process violation because the police power had been properly invoked, and thus, compensation was not required. The license necessary to a person who had four or more junk vehicles at a single location as a motor vehicle wrecking facility was not granted unless the vehicles were shielded from public view, pursuant to M.A.C. 16-2.14(2)-S 14261. The shielding requirement was a valid exercise of the State's police power to preserve or enhance aesthetic values. The court further rejected defendant's claim that his conviction on the second charge of failure to license his junk vehicle accumulation was barred by an earlier conviction for violating the same statute. The two separate complaints had charged distinct offenses. Double jeopardy applied only when the &quot;same offense&quot; was involved in a first and second trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment for the Board, and the citizens appealed, urging that the trial court erroneously construed the resolution as administrative, and thus, not subject to referendum. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that the initiative and referendum process extended only to legislative action and not to administrative acts. The court agreed with the trial court's determination that the proposed resolution addressed itself to an administrative function. In calling for bids for the road paving, the Board was attempting to fulfill its duty and responsibility to maintain and manage county roads, and thus, was performing an administrative act by the execution of an existing law. Thus, the court concluded that the proposed resolution to prevent the use of funds and the acceptance of bids concerned an administrative function and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was married to the victim's sister, allegedly asked the victim to go with him to discuss his marital problems with the sister. They first went to a bar and then purchased some wine and drove around drinking it in the victim's car. At one point they pulled off the road, and when the car got stuck, defendant allegedly had forcible sex with the victim. A passing motorist helped them get back on the road, and they drove back to where defendant had left his motorcycle and again had forcible sex. The victim was examined the following day by her family doctor, who contacted the police. Defendant was convicted, and the court affirmed, finding that the trial court had not erred in allowing the prosecution to introduce evidence that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony. Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 93-1901-11 (Smith 1947) specifically provided that a witness could be impeached by evidence of a prior conviction of a felony, and it had not been repealed as defendant contended. Nor could Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 24, 28 be construed to prohibit such impeachment. The testimony of an accused, as in the case of any other witness, was subject to attack by impeachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was employed to operate a motel. Her duties included working the desk and switchboard, keeping records, and doing a large part of the daily cleaning and maintenance. She was paid a salary plus overtime for hours worked on her day off. She was required to live in an apartment at the motel. After her employer denied her request for a raise, she filed a wage claim. The Department found that the employee was not a bona fide executive, and thus was entitled to minimum hourly wages under the Montana Minimum Wage and Hours Act. The Department awarded her back wages, based upon her testimony that she worked 16 hours a day. On appeal by the employer, the court affirmed. The court held that the employee was not a bona fide executive as defined by Mont. Admin. Code 24-3.14BII(2)-S1420. -S1450(13), because she exercised little discretion and spent most of her time performing non-executive work. The court further held that the award of back wages in the absence of time cards was not clearly erroneous, because the employee offered evidence of the hours she worked, and the employer failed to offer precise evidence to refute her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was plaintiff's action against defendants, the members of the Board of Housing of the state of Montana, seeking a declaratory judgment pursuant to Mont. Rev. Code Ann. tit. 93, ch. 89 (1947) to have the Housing Act of 1975 which was passed as Chapter 461, Laws of 1975, declared unconstitutional on several grounds. The court accepted original jurisdiction pursuant to Mont. R. App. Civ. P. 17(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a declaratory judgment finding the Housing Act of 1975 to be constitutional. It found that because the board chose the interest subsidy means to assist persons in attaining safe, sanitary and healthful housing, which involved very little direct government interference with the individual's choice of the type of housing he wished to live in, the Housing Act was properly enacted to accomplish a public purpose and was reasonably structured to accomplish this end. The legislation did not improperly bind successive legislatures to appropriate money. The court found that that the delegation to the board of the power to set a minimum qualifying income was not an impermissible delegation. The creation by the board of revenue bonds or trust indentures and their flow was not in conflict with the constitutional provision for the unified investment of funds, as the trust indenture funds were not deposited with the treasurer and the funds received from the sale of the resolution bonds were by statute deemed continuously appropriated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation challenged a judgment of the District Court of Dawson County, Seventh Judicial District (Montana), which found in favor of respondent water company. The trial court held that the water company complied with Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 89-811 (1947) by timely proceeding to prosecute the excavation or construction of the diversion works for appropriation of water.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department sought a declaratory judgment that the water company did not have a valid appropriation of water from the Yellowstone River and enjoining the water company from use of the water. The water company counterclaimed, alleging that it had complied with Montana water appropriation statutes and was entitled to relate the priority of its appropriation back. The trial court granted judgment to the water company. The court affirmed as modified. The water company was the owner of an &quot;existing right&quot; under the Water Use Act of 1973 but was not the owner of a valid appropriation of the waters of the river. The water company complied with Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 89-811 (1947), requiring that it timely proceed to prosecute the excavation or construction of the work by which the water appropriated was to be diverted, because the statute did not require the commencement of actual on-site excavation or construction of the diversion works, but encompassed the steady on-going effort in good faith by the water company to prosecute the construction of the project. The water company had a right to claim appropriation of the water by pursuing the project with reasonable diligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment but modified it to strike out the final two paragraphs of the trial court's judgment that rendered an advisory opinion and went beyond an adjudication of the water company's rights and status in relation to its proposed project and activities under Montana water appropriation statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of deliberate homicide and aggravated homicide of a school teacher and sentenced to death. On appeal, defendant presented 25 issues. The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court first held that the death penalty did not violate the Sixth, Eight, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution. The court also held that there was no constitutional violation by the lack of jury participation in the sentence. The court noted that while Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 94-5-102 provided that a person who was convicted of deliberate homicide be sentenced to death, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 94-5-103 permitted a sentence of imprisonment if there were mitigating circumstances. The court found that defendant's conduct in killing the victim was unreasonable and without any mitigating circumstances. The court then found no error in the arrest and search warrants because they were supported by probable cause. Furthermore, evidence obtained as a result of the search, including photographic evidence, was properly admitted at trial. The court held that any error in the trial was merely clerical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administrator sought review of the decision of the District Court of Gallatin County (Montana), which entered a judgment of dismissal in a survival action for defendant architect and which granted summary judgment to defendants, a manufacturer and an electric company, on the basis of the 10-year limitation period of Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 93-2619 (Smith 1947).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company installed the manufacturer's whirlpool machine in a field house. The field house construction was completed prior to 1960. The administrator's decedent was electrocuted in 1973 when a charge emanated from the machine, electrifying the water in which the decedent was bathing. In 1975, the administrator filed a survival suit against defendants seeking damages. The district court entered a judgment of dismissal for the architect and summary judgment for the company and the manufacturer. The court held that, as the legislature was not constitutionally prohibited under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 from eliminating a common law right, the 10-year limitation period of Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 93-2619 (Smith 1947), the architects' and builders' statute, was a valid bar to the survival suit against defendants protected by it. While the architect and the company were protected by &sect; 93-2619, materialmen were not within the class protected by the statute. In light of the facts that the manufacturer took no part in the construction of the field house, and that the manufacturer was sued as a materialman, the administrator's claim against the manufacturer was not barred by &sect; 93-2619.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decision as to the judgment of dismissal in favor of the architect and the summary judgment in favor of the company. The court reversed the district court's decision as to the summary judgment that was in favor of the manufacturer. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that &sect; 94-5-503 was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment because it only criminalized males who had sexual intercourse without consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused contended that Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-132, 54-133 (1947) failed to state a crime and that the federal Controlled Substances Act preempted Montana's Dangerous Drug Act. The court denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding. The court noted an oversight on the part of the codifier in making amended legislation look like two separate acts in the Revised Codes of Montana and pointed out that the acts of the codifier could not change the intent of the legislature. The court stated that the legislation codified under Mont. Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-301 to 54-327 (1947), including the definition of dangerous drug, was intended to amend and be included as part of the Montana Dangerous Drug Act. The court found no evidence that the federal act was in any way meant to preempt the state's right to drug control. The court concluded that it could not be said that the states had no authority to regulate in the field of drugs or narcotics, including the authority to specify the punishment to be imposed, pointing out that Congress made clear in 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 903 that it did not intend to occupy the field to the exclusion of state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition of the accused for a writ of supervisory control over the trial court and its judge in the accused's challenge to his drug prosecution and dismissed the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit against defendants, title insurers who were issuing and underwriting title insurance policies without written evidence of the condition of title as required by Mont.

The issue was whether the statute was constitutional under the Montana Constitution or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reversed, holding that the statute discriminated in favor of those agents who were writing title insurance on the basis of legal opinions on July 1, 1961, and against those licensed agents who later attempted to do so, and thereby, was in violation of the guarantee of equal protection of the laws and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court because the title insurance statute violated the Equal Protection Clause and was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of the District Court of Madison County (Montana), which granted summary judgment to defendant in an appeal of his conviction by a justice of the peace for violating Mont. Rev. Code &sect; 26-909 (1947), Montana's Resident Guide Law. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute. He contended, in part, a violation of his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a non-resident, conceded that he had hunted big game in a national forest without a resident guide, a violation of the statute. He argued that the law denied him equal protection and placed an undue burden on interstate commerce, a violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. On appeal, the court applied the rational basis test and held that the law violated equal protection because the relationship between the statutory classification and its legitimate objectives was too tenuous and remote to justify the inequities it engendered. The court found that the law, which related to the protection of wildlife, was a legitimate and proper exercise of governmental authority. Next, the court reviewed the law's distinction between residents and non-residents, and noted that defendant, though a non-resident, owned property in the state. The court could find no reasonable relationship between the law's purpose, which according to the State was to protect hunters in unfamiliar terrain and its classifications because non-residents who owned land in the state would know their way around the terrain. Further, the law had been waived for hunting in some parts of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendant in his action challenging his conviction in a justice of the peace court for violating the state's resident guide law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer from one county telephoned an officer in a second county giving information from a reliable informant that a shipment of marijuana would be brought by airplane by a man of a certain description in a certain suitcase. Officers from the first county went to the airport and arrested defendant after he picked up the suitcase, which contained marijuana, as identified by the officers and later by a state chemist. The court held that although the chemist was not endorsed on the information as a witness, the trial court did not error in failing to grant defendant a continuance after the chemist testified. A proper foundation was offered to support testimony that the police officers could identify marijuana by sight and smell and substantial evidence supported their finding. One police officer's testimony regarding his telephone conversations with the officer from the second county was not hearsay where it was introduced to show the existence of probable cause to make the arrest without a warrant and subsequent search. There was ample evidence that the substance was cannabis sativa 1. The arrest was amply justified by probable cause; therefore the search was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and respondent wife sought review of a judgment from the District Court of Hill County, Twelfth Judicial District (Montana), which modified the alimony provisions of a divorce decree. Upon review, the court was asked to determine the constitutionality of the alimony statute, the appropriateness of alimony when a divorce had not been granted to a wife, and the sufficiency of the trial court's increase in alimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the husband and the wife had been guilty of mental cruelty and that each was entitled to a divorce, but because the husband had been the only party to petition for a divorce, the husband was granted the divorce. Thereafter, the trial court divided the marital property and awarded the wife alimony. Later, the wife petitioned for a modification of the decree, and when alimony was increased, both parties took exception to the new order. Thereafter, the trial court held that the increase had been unconstitutional and void. However, the trial court also held that because the husband had failed to appeal from the alimony award and had paid the wife, it would be against public policy to allow the husband to set aside the award. Upon review, the court reversed, holding it was unable to decide the constitutionality of the alimony statute because the husband's constitutional attack was procedurally improper under Mont. R. App. P. 38. The court also held that even though it had been inappropriate to award alimony to the wife, as the wife had not been granted a divorce, the husband's payment of alimony had estopped the husband from seeking relief from its burdens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reversing a judgment which modified the alimony provisions of a divorce decree, the court refused to determine the constitutionality of the alimony statute and upheld the sufficiency of the trial court's increase in alimony. The court also held that even though the wife's alimony award had been inappropriate, as the wife had not been granted a divorce, the husband had been estopped from seeking relief from the award's burdens.</SPAN></P>
