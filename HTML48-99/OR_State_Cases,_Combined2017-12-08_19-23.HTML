<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers paid taxes in Canada and claimed a foreign tax credit on their federal income tax returns for 1981 through 1985. The taxpayers claimed the Canadian taxes as deductible business expenses on their Oregon income tax returns. The Department disallowed the claimed deduction. The court held that: (1) for foreign taxes, ORS 316.690 took precedence over ORS 316.716(3); (2) it was assumed that whenever the legislature enacted a provision, it had in mind previous statutes relating to the same subject matter, and in the absence of any express repeal or amendment, the new provision was presumed in accord with the legislative policy embodied in those prior statutes; (3) the deduction allowed the taxpayers was limited by ORS 316.690, which did not distinguish between foreign taxes paid as a business expense and taxes paid as a personal expense; and (4) in effect, the legislature had determined to treat taxes paid to foreign countries, whether they were a business expense or personal expense, in the same manner as federal income taxes and under the same general limitation.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, the assessor and the county, and the department stipulated to values substantially higher than those found by the department. The taxpayers intervened to protect their interests in maintaining the properties at the lower values found by the department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With this posture, the taxpayers were the appealing parties and bore the burden of persuasion. The unusual and complex case concerned the value of land under 10 oceanfront motels. In connection with the issue of true cash value, the parties were in disagreement as to the size of the parcels; what was to be included in the land value; the appropriate methods and measures for establishing true cash value; and the application of the concept of highest and best use under the assessment statutes. In addition, the taxpayers sought relief on the grounds of lack of uniformity and plaintiffs' bad faith conduct. Where the land was improved plaintiff assessor had to consider the highest and best use of the total property, but he had to allocate a portion of that total value to the land as though it were vacant. The preponderance of the evidence supported one of the appraiser's values for the oceanfront property. The court set the true cash value for the subject properties. The court found that there was not a lack of uniformity in the assessment of the land. The court further held that the taxpayers were not entitled to attorney fees due to plaintiffs' alleged lack of good faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department appraised all timber and forest land in western Oregon and furnished such information to the tax assessors, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 321.622. The Department's appraisal of forest land values for January 1, 1977, resulted in significant increases over the prior year. Although none of the companies appealed their forest land values, massive numbers of other forest land owners did appeal. Under the then existing appeal procedures, it was a lengthy process to obtain a court decision. Fearful that the massive number of appeals would create chaos at the county level, forest industry and government officials sought immediate legislative relief, and 1977 Or. Laws 892 (Act), was enacted. The companies then filed a request for declaratory relief, alleging that the representative formula and the &quot;notice&quot; provisions of the Act violated U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV, Or. Const. art. I, &sect; &sect; 10, 20, 32. The court denied the request, by holding that the companies' claim that the Act resulted in a lack of uniformity was without merit because it made a determination of five percent or more of the land value binding on all other forest land owners in that market area for that year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bottler sought a determination that the property assessed by the Department was personal property. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.010 defined &quot;real property&quot; to include the land itself and machinery or fixtures erected upon, under, above or affixed to the same. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.020(3) defined &quot;tangible personal property&quot; to include all chattels and movables. The issue on appeal was whether the bottler's machinery and equipment was &quot;movable&quot; within the meaning of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.020(3). The court noted that the Department's rule, which more specifically defined real property with regard to machinery and equipment, went beyond Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.010(1) as it required more than the common ordinary words conveyed. The court found that to the extent that the regulation attempted to narrow the statute, it was invalid. The court also found that most of the subject property was &quot;affixed&quot; or &quot;erected upon&quot; real property. It was likewise clear that the equipment was not &quot;freely movable&quot; as asserted by the bottler.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers raised numerous challenges to the ESD's tax levy. The court rejected each claim and upheld the levy. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 334.025(3), providing for the election of an ESD's directors, did not violate the one man-one vote principle because this principle did not apply to administrative agencies. The court found that one disputed budget committee member lived within the district, as required. Although the other contested member did not meet the residency requirements, the court found that even if this member had been disqualified, the actions of the budget committee would not have been different. Although the taxpayers established minor defects in the notice of the budget committee meeting and in the summary of the budget, the court held that these defects were insufficient to void the levy. Similarly, although the committee changed the date of a subsequent meeting after announcing its date, the court found that the change was publicized and that no taxpayers were prejudiced. Because there was substantial compliance by the ESD with the statutory requirements, the court held that the tax levy should be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed an action against defendant, an educational service district (ESD), in which they challenged a tax levy that the ESD imposed under the provisions of ORS 334.025(3) and 334.240(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ESD provided services to the common school districts within its geographical boundaries. Seventy-five percent of the voters within the ESD's area lived within school district 5-J, less than 5 percent of the voters resided in school district 16-J, 4 percent lived in school district 30-J, and less than 15 percent resided in school district 61. On the basis of this distribution of population, the taxpayers contended that ORS 334.025(3) was unconstitutional because it violated the one man-one vote principle of the United States Constitution as to the voters in district 5-J. In dismissing the complaint, the court held that ORS 334.025(3) was not unconstitutional because the one man-one vote principle was limited to legislative bodies and was not applicable to those whose functions were primarily administrative. The court found that the ESD functioned as an administrative board, not as a legislative body. Despite issues concerning the status of the ESD board's members, notice of the budget meeting, the adequacy of the budget message, and the board's accumulation of funds, the court found that on the whole, the levy was prepared in substantial compliance with the relevant statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency claimed at a hearing on the companies' motions for protective orders that one of the companies surrendered certain information to the agency on condition of confidentiality and that the agency wished to present the information to the court. Because of confidentiality, the agency requested that the hearing be closed to all but court personnel and the parties' representatives. Opposing counsel, who represented both companies, objected to the motion on ground that all court proceedings were public and that the parties had a right to be present. The court speculated that counsel wished to prevent the agency's use of the information in court. The court denied the agency's motion to exclude the public. The court held that as a general rule the constitutional right of public access to judicial proceedings must prevail over confidentiality. The legislature expressly subordinated the confidentiality statutes, especially Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 308.411(4), 305.420(5), to the public trial policy. Because the subject of the litigation was that which the statutes made confidential, the information in question could not remain confidential, at least in relation to court proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers included retirement income paid by the State of South Dakota on their state income tax returns, paid the taxes, and filed claims for refunds. The Department treated the retirement benefits as taxable income and denied the refunds. The denial was based on ORS 316.067(1)(c), which allowed the subtraction from taxable income of amounts received from a pension, annuity, retirement, or similar fund under a public retirement system established only by the federal government, the State of Oregon, or one of its municipal corporations or political subdivisions. The taxpayers appealed and contended that the statute was unconstitutional because its classification violated the Privileges and Immunity Clause, &sect; 2, Article IV, United States Constitution and the equal protection of laws under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Department argued that the statute was part of a scheme to protect employee benefits. The Department reasoned that if the benefits were tax free, then less benefits needed to be provided.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers were partners and, in 1973, Oregon property owned by the partnership was acquired by the United States through eminent domain proceedings and the partnership realized a gain for income tax purposes. The partnership elected to defer recognition of the gain for state and federal income tax purposes under I.R.C. &sect; 1303 (1954) by acquiring like-kind property consisting of a theatre and a ranch in Oregon and a post office facility in Illinois. Department of Revenue disallowed nonrecognition treatment as applied to the investment in the Illinois property pursuant to ORS 314.290, which limited the deferral of tax recognition of gain to exchanges where the property newly acquired has a situs in Oregon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs asserted that the assessments imposed by the Boundary Commission were, in fact, taxes imposed to cover the general operating expenses of the Boundary Commission and such taxes were unconstitutional because they were not borne uniformly by the citizens within the boundary commission's jurisdiction. The court found that the district had a sufficiently adverse interest in the case to give it standing. The court noted that the taxpayer's standing was questionable because he paid no taxes to the Boundary Commission; however, he was not an essential plaintiff. The court stated that ORS 199.457(4) and (5) authorized the Boundary Commission to impose taxes. The court determined that each governmental unit that the taxpayer paid taxes to was assessed uniformly by the Boundary Commission. The court found that the Boundary Commission's taxation did not violate the uniformity provision of art. I, &sect; 32 of the Oregon Constitution. The court concluded that the Boundary Commission followed the uniformity mandate and ORS 199.457(4) and (5) were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deficiencies arose from the understatement by the taxpayers of income taxes by &quot;converting&quot; Federal Reserve Notes received to specie dollars. The taxpayers contended that gold and silver were the only measures of money defined in the United States Constitution. The court found that Juilliard v. Greenman, 110 U.S. 421, 4 S. Ct. 122, 28 L. Ed. 204 (1884), had been relied upon since 1884 to sustain the constitutionality of a statute requiring creditors to accept U.S. paper money as legal tender. The court did not have the power to overrule the determination of the United States Supreme Court in its constitutional interpretations. Further, courts have uniformly held that Federal Reserve notes constituted legal tender, which must be reported on a taxpayer's return in accordance with his method of accounting; and they have uniformly rejected, in a summary fashion, all arguments to the contrary. The use of all U.S. currencies as legal tender for tax purposes was specified in 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 392. The taxpayers' logic had to be addressed to the U.S. Congress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widower's deceased wife was a war veteran. The widower claimed a partial property tax exemption under ORS 307.250(4), which provided that a widow of a war veteran was exempt from taxation. The county assessor denied the application under the plain language of the statute, which refereed to a widow, not a widower. The widower appealed to the Department, which ruled that it had no authority to hold the statute unconstitutional. The court held that there was no scintilla of testimony that justified continuing the discrimination between the sexes that appeared in ORS 307.250(4). The statute's purpose was to award the honorable military service rendered by a veteran who owned a homestead in the State or to the widow of such veteran. The statute was an unconstitutional discrimination against widowers on the sole basis of sex in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Constitution, and the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and Or. Const, art I, &sect; 20. However, the court concluded that the widower could take nothing by his complaint.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order of the Oregon Department of Revenue adjusting her personal income tax returns by including half of her husband's earnings from a community property state pursuant to ORS 150-316.048 (Oregon). The question presented was whether the taxpayer wife was taxable in Oregon on half of the husband's earnings in Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer wife lived in Oregon. Her husband had moved to Washington for a job, but there was no evidence that the parties intended to sever their marital relationship. The court rejected the argument that the husband's earnings were not community property because the wife was not domiciled in Washington. The fact that spouses lived in different states did not terminate the community. The wife also asserted that the spouses were &quot;living separate and apart,&quot; which would make the husband's income his separate property under RCW 26.16.140 (Washington). The phrase &quot;living separate and apart&quot; implied more than mere physical separation and required evidence that the spouses intended a severance of marital relations, although not necessarily a divorce. Under Oregon law, ORS 150-316.048 (Oregon), a spouse was taxable in Oregon on community property to which he or she was entitled under the law of a community property state where it was earned. Washington law provided that half of the husband's earnings vested in the wife. Therefore, the court held that the Oregon taxpayer wife was taxable on half of her husband's earnings from Washington.</SPAN></P>

The Department held that the lands were exempt because submerged and submersible lands were property granted to the state and proceeds from any state lands could only be diverted to the Common School Fund, not to a county. The court held that the order incorrectly construed the applicable law. The State Land Board had authority to require users of submerged and submersible land underlying navigable waters in Oregon to enter into leases and to pay rental for their use. The court found that the proceeds from all lands granted to the State were to be deposited with the Common School Fund. Submerged and submersible lands, however, were not granted to the State but were originally owned by the State as the soil under navigable waters. The proceeds from the leasing of such lands were to be deposited with the school fund. Under ORS 307.110, however, leased state property was still subject to assessment and taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiffs agreed to buy the land, they sought a special assessment as farm use property under ORS 308.370 for the tax year. They averred that while the land had been platted by their seller under ORS chapter 92, it had never been developed and all of the platted property had been sold as one parcel. They also claimed that because the land was otherwise qualified for the assessment under ORS 215.203, the application was properly granted. However, both the assessor and the Board denied the application. Plaintiffs appealed, but the court affirmed. After reviewing statutes bearing on the issue and noting the existence of latent ambiguities in the language used therein, the court pointed out that the obvious legislative intent was to aid in the preservation of farmland by giving the benefits of ORS 308.370(1) to bona fide farmers in counties that were slow to adopt farm use zoning under ORS 308.370(1). Nevertheless, because settled rules of statutory construction supported the Board's order and because the court was not authorized to rewrite the statute or ignore the plain meaning of its unambiguous words, despite sympathy for plaintiffs, the court affirmed the order below.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the constitution was not offended by taxation based on a state's provision of opportunities given, protection afforded, or benefits conferred, which the corporation enjoyed by virtue of its Oregon residence. Beyond that, the court noted that it was the shareholders who elected S-corporation status, and that the assessment under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">These two consolidated cases presented the identical issue on appeal from orders of the Department concerning valuation of farm property for inheritance tax purposes. The property had been assessed at its true cash value as unzoned farmland under ORS 308.370(2). However, after the relevant assessment dates but before inventories were filed, the county passed a farm use ordinance providing more favorable assessments pursuant to ORS 308.370(1). The taxpayers used the newer, lower assessment on their inventories, but the Department refused to accept it. The court affirmed the Department's position, holding that the taxpayers could not take advantage of the more preferable assessment category because it was not in existence at the relevant assessment date. The special farm use zoning ordinance imposed restrictions on the use of the property, even after the death of current owner. Therefore, it was not providing dissimilar treatment of similar property. The new zoning category created a new and different zone that could be treated differently than general unzoned farmland.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order of defendant, the Oregon Department of Revenue, which determined a gift tax deficiency in a certain calendar year. The asserted deficiency resulted from the Department's classification of the donee as the taxpayer's nephew, rather than as the taxpayer's son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1972, the taxpayer adopted her nephew, who was over 21 years old. At that time, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 119.005(2) provided that a donee related to a donor by legal adoption was to be considered as related in the same degree as though they were related by natural blood. In 1973, an amendment was added to &sect; 119.005(2) that provided that if the person was more than 21 years of age at the time of the adoption, any transfer of property within three years after the adoption was subject to tax under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 119.061. Thereafter, the taxpayer made a gift to nephew. The Department determined that the gift to the nephew was subjected to an additional or collateral tax by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 119.061(3), and the exemption for a son under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 119.061(2) did not apply. On review, the court held that the gift was taxable as a gift to a nephew because the gift was made after the effective date of the amendment and within three years of the adoption. The application of the amendment did not amount to a retroactive tax. If the gift had been delayed six months, it would have been outside the three-year period. The tax ramifications were foreseeable when the taxpayer delivered her gift.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 316.067(3) in the Personal Income Tax Act of 1969.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, who was not yet 65 years old, received compensation from a retirement system for service in the United States Armed Forces.

Stat. &sect; 316.067(1)(c) to which he would otherwise have been entitled and that the subclassification of persons receiving income from a public retirement system established by the United States into those persons who received income for service in the Armed Forces and all other persons receiving retirement income from the United States was unconstitutional. Armed Forces retirees had the potential of earning additional income in a civilian career, which most other federal employees did not have, because of the structure of their retirement system; therefore, the court found that it was reasonable for the legislature to consider this possibility as a basis for the classifications made in Or. Rev.

The taxpayer asked the Department to further reduce the assessment to $ 36,500 but the Department affirmed the board's assessment. The taxpayer sought further review. The court affirmed, holding that the assessment set forth in the Department's order was supported by the preponderance of the evidence under the market approach, which required evidence of the &quot;market&quot; for a particular property by the identification of sales of comparable property in the area on or near the assessment date. Here, the taxpayer made the common assumption of laymen that all assessments by the county assessor, except his own, equaled true cash value. The court noted that the taxpayer set himself an almost impossible task by seeking a reduction in value of a personal residence that was within eight percent of the assessed value as established by the county board of equalization and the Department.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer challenged defendant Department of Revenue, which demurred to the taxpayer's complaint because the facts alleged did not constitute a cause of action. The issue was whether the legislature enacted a statute which violated the requirement of uniformity in tax treatment of the same class of subjects, as required by Oregon Constitution, Art I, &sect; 32, by purporting to create a &quot;class&quot; consisting of husband and wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the complaint was inartistic, argumentative, and improper in form, the substance served the purpose of a complaint, which alleged that the federal income tax the taxpayer and his wife paid exceeded $ 3,000. The taxpayer contended that he and his wife, on a joint return, were each entitled to a $ 3,000 deduction. No distinction was made by statute between separate and joint returns. &quot;Federal taxable income&quot; was the sum inserted for tax purposes in a particular Oregon tax return, whether the return was separate or joint. No section in ORS chapter 316 suggested otherwise. Oregon Laws 1973, ch 751, &sect; 1, had to be read as applying to both single and joint returns and limiting the federal income tax deduction on that return to $ 3,000. The language of the statute did not require the result sought by the taxpayer and the applicable rules of statutory construction did not permit it. The court took judicial notice of interpretation of the tax statutes by the Department of Revenue through its duly promulgated regulation. Its contemporaneous construction of an Act was persuasive. The taxpayer did not allege a cause of action and the Department's demurrer had to be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The registration fee on the airplane was paid 13 days after the February 28 deadline for payment. The evidence indicated the late payment was the fault of the corporation's officers and of an inadequately trained, part-time employee who were unaware of the change made by the 1973 legislature as to the payment deadline. If the registration fee was not paid by February 28 of the assessment year, the aircraft was then assessed as omitted property and was subject to both registration and personal property tax pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 493.090(2). The corporation's contended that it qualified as a hardship case under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.475, and further the penalty in this case was not proper. The record did not show that the corporation ever appealed to the Director of the DOR for hardship relief under the specific provisions of Or. Rev.

The stock appreciated in value during their Illinois residency. The taxpayers moved to Oregon, and the stock continued to appreciate in value.

The Department taxed the gain that the taxpayers realized on the appreciated stock for the entire period that they held the securities, including the time that they were Illinois residents. The taxpayers argued that Oregon should tax their gain, if any, only during the period they were Oregon residents. Affirming, the court held that the retroactive effect of the state income tax, as applied to the taxpayers' gain on the sale of their stock, was not unconstitutional as impairing the obligation of contracts because credits, deductions, or exemptions to or from income were matters of legislative grace and not a matter of taxpayer right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order of the trial court (Oregon) sustaining a demurrer of defendant Department of Revenue affirming the assessment of omitted personal property for certain tax years as made by a county assessor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the Department had a statutory duty to advise the county assessor that the county was required to assess and tax the omitted property for prior years because the property remained taxable under ORS 311.207(1) et seq. (Oregon). The trial court found that a delay in the assessor's action pursuant to &sect; 311.207(1) was not fatal to the action. The taxpayer argued that the fact that a personal property exemption had been applied under ORS 307.810 et seq. (Oregon) estopped the assessor from reversing the exemption retroactively. The taxpayer also contended that the delay of the assessment of the tax was fatal and that the tax was discriminatorily applied to it. The court determined the tax was improper because it was discriminatorily applied. The evidence showed that only manufacturing corporations had been subject to the assessment of omitted taxes under ORS 311.027(1) (Oregon) representing a violation of the equal protection of laws against such corporations. To put the taxpayer and others similarly situated back in the position they would have been in if not improperly taxed, the court found that they were entitled to repayment of the wrongly assessed taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer conducted business both inside and outside of the state. The department assessed corporation excise taxes for four separate years on the taxpayer and denied a refund claim for one tax year. The taxpayer sought review protesting the prospective application of the department's three-factor formula for a certain tax year for apportioning the income of financial institutions doing business within and without the state. The taxpayer further argued against the disallowance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation's (FSLIC) secondary reserve expense deduction for three tax years. Finally, the taxpayer protested the denial of a refund claim for a certain tax year for taxes paid in the event that it was determined that the FSLIC secondary reserve payment was not deductible. On appeal, the court affirmed both orders. The court held that the taxpayer had the burden of showing that the regulations adopted by the department were improper. The court found that the department could have amended its regulations under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.280, even through such regulations were adopted under a statute which had been frequently reenacted by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, determining that an adopted child who inherited through her natural parent was not exempt from the collateral inheritance tax under the provisions of ORS 118.100(1), which established the classification of a &quot;child.&quot; The taxpayer did not meet her burden of proving her right to the tax exemption, which there was a presumption that the legislature did not grant. Because 118.100(1) was ambiguous with regard to whether an adopted child was the &quot;child&quot; of her natural father under its terms, the court construed 118.100(1) and ORS 109.041(1), regarding the rights and relationships of adopted children, in pari materia.

Affirming, the court said that the corporation had not met the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the unitary concept had failed to determine fairly and accurately the amount of income subject to tax in Oregon. The court held that the corporation and the subsidiary were dependent upon and contributed to each other to such an extent that to have permitted them to report on a segregated basis would have distorted the income attributable to the Oregon operations. Though the operations possibly could have been operated as separate businesses, they were operated as a vertically integrated process, the parts being separated only by the veil of separate incorporation. A strong showing was required to justify deviation from the apportionment approach after the unitary business was proven. The showing did not reach the requisite level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sold their home in California in 1966. The taxpayers' gain on the sale was deferred for federal income tax purposes. The taxpayers bought a home in Oregon. In 1969, the taxpayers sold their Oregon home and moved to Louisiana. On their 1969 federal income tax return, the taxpayers deducted the adjusted basis of their Oregon home from its sale price and reported a gain that they deferred. On their Oregon tax return, they reported a net gain on the sale of their Oregon home of the difference between the purchase and sale price. The Department recomputed the gain and ordered the taxpayers to carry over their federal basis from the California home to the Oregon home and pay tax upon the gain measured from the Oregon home sale. The taxpayers filed an action challenging the Department's assessment. The court determined that Oregon's income tax was based not on the taxpayers' capital gain but on what was included in their federal taxable income for the 1969 tax year. ORS 314.290 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV and was not discriminatory because it treated residents and nonresidents alike where property transferred by a taxpayer had a situs in Oregon.</SPAN></P>

The assessor corrected the amount of land and compromises were made on the value for the years. In subsequent years, the owners had been assessed at $ 3.37 per square foot while the other taxpayer and the partnership were only assessed $ 1.00 per square foot for their shopping center property. Affirming, the court found that the assessment of the owners' land was discriminatory. The Department failed to prove that the owners' shopping center property was more valuable than the other shopping center property. A taxpayer was not typically entitled to relief merely because a neighboring property assessment was lower, but arbitrary or systemic discrimination in assessment offended the equal protection rights of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

They had some Oregon income in 1969, which income was salary earned by them within the State of Oregon. They filed a joint return and claimed the right to deduct a specified percent of total personal expenses, itemized on their federal return. That was done on the theory that they were entitled to deduct the same proportion of personal expenses as their Oregon income bore to their total income. Such was the rule in 1969 made applicable by the Oregon Personal Income Tax Act of 1969 when the nonresident taxpayer took the standard deduction in his federal return, but not when he itemized his deductions. The Department disallowed the claimed deductions, finding that they were not connected with sources within the State of Oregon, and a deficiency was assessed. The taxpayers appealed, contending that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 316.117 and 316.127 were unconstitutional because they discriminated against nonresidents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department's auditor assessed additional personal income taxes for 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969 based upon an audit performed by the federal government. The Department made no independent examination of the taxpayers' books or records. The Department sustained the assessment. The court held that the proposed 1966 and 1967 tax assessments were not time barred because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.410(3) extended the limitations period where, inter alia, there was a federal correction of a taxpayer's return. Further, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.405(1) did not require the Department to make an independent audit, and the manner in which it received information was not limited. Moreover, the taxpayers were afforded their due process rights to notice, to be heard, and to examine witnesses. However, Or. Tax. Reg. 316.047-(A) (1969) turned the exclusion of annual annuity receipts into a deduction. The purpose of the Personal Income Tax Act of 1969 was to utilize the taxpayers' federal return with the fewest possible modifications. Thus, the auditor's adjustment was improper, and that part of Reg. 316.047-(A) on which the auditor based his adjustment was void because it exceeded Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.047.</SPAN></P>

The permittees were allowed to construct improvements on the property, and the value of the improvements had been taxed under ORS 307.060 (Oregon) for many years. Defendants then attempted to tax the permittees' interests in the real property underlying the improvements, and the permittees sought a declaratory judgment that the land was not subject to taxation. The court found for defendants and held that the permittees' interests in the land were similar to leasehold interests, which were taxable under ORS 307.060 (Oregon). There was no double taxation of the property merely because the permittees paid rent to the United States for the use of the land. The court rejected the argument that the possessory interest had no value, citing evidence that permittees sold their holdings at a price substantially above the value of the improvements alone. The separate and distinct classification between use of federal land for grazing purposes and for personal recreational residence use was not unconstitutionally discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers contended that the statutes violated the equal privileges and immunities provision of U.S. Const. art IV, &sect; 2., in that they failed to allow nonresidents who elected to itemize deductions on their federal income tax returns to prorate those deductions on their Oregon returns, while residents could do so. The court rejected the argument and found that the statutes, part of the Personal Income Tax Act of 1969, were not arbitrary or unreasonable. The difference in consequences resulting from the election was not discriminatory but stemmed from the election itself. Every Oregon taxpayer, resident and nonresident, was required to use his federal return as the controlling basis of his state return, and every taxpayer had the same privilege of electing whether to itemize his personal deductions or use the standard deduction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers filed suit against defendant Oregon Department of Revenue seeking an income tax refund based on the allegation of the taxpayers that a portion of a cash distribution they received as stockholders of a utility company was not a dividend under ORS 316.010(6) (Oregon) and was not includable in gross income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought an income tax refund, but the Department failed to act and the taxpayers sought relief in tax court. The key issue was whether the distribution was a dividend. Of the distributions made by the utility company in the year in question, the majority was not out of either accumulated or current earnings and profits as calculated for federal income tax purposes and was not a dividend to the taxpayers for such purposes. The Department, however, claimed that earnings and profits of the utility company were to be calculated as earned surplus or book income and that because enough earned surplus existed to cover the dividends, the distributions were all taxable. The court found that due to the similarity between the state and federal statutes, it was clear that the Oregon Legislature had adopted the federal interpretation of earnings and profits as based on taxable income rather than book income. Adopting such interpretation was not unconstitutional because it did not adopt future federal laws, but merely enacted a law based on current federal law. Thus, none of the income in question was taxable and the requested refund was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission issued a declaratory ruling that the taxpayer could not file a consolidated corporate excise tax return with its parent company. Upon review, the court affirmed because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 317.360(1) did not allow two domestic corporations doing business solely within the State of Oregon to file consolidated returns. The statute was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because it did not give the commission absolute discretion to decide when consolidated returns could be filed. Rather, the statute imposed limitations: the two corporations had to be affiliated, the income of one had to be affected by arrangement with the other, and the tax was limited to the income properly attributable to the state. If the statute were unconstitutional, the taxpayer would have no authority for filing a consolidated return with its parent under any circumstances. The commission was not required in its declaratory ruling to state under what other circumstances it would allow the filing of consolidated returns by two Oregon corporations. It only had to answer whether the taxpayer and its parent should be allowed to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1964 the taxpayers bought $ 5,000 worth of stock. In 1966 the stock became worthless and the taxpayers claimed a loss on their 1966 state tax returns. The agency disallowed most of the deduction because the state's enactment of the Internal Revenue Code's capital gains provision restricted losses from worthless securities to short-term capital losses. The agency treated the loss as a short-term capital loss and limited it as an offset against ordinary income, with loss carryover to subsequent years. The taxpayers appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the loss was deductible in 1966, but that the 1967 amendment to OR. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.405 was retroactive to July 1, 1965. The court found that the amendment did not eliminate the loss but treated it as a capital loss limited to an offset against ordinary income to $ 1,000 per year with a carryover to succeeding years. The court found that the legislature had the authority to enact a law that had a reasonable retroactive effect on transactions occurring prior to its enactment, particularly with respect to tax statutes where there was no constitutional prohibition against retroactive or retrospective laws.</SPAN></P>

The court held that ORS 317.247(5) (Oregon), which provided that gain on a sale of assets that was ultimately distributed to nonresident stockholders was to be taxed to the corporation, was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. Corporations without nonresident stockholders were not subject to the tax. The court ruled that no substantial reason for the difference in treatment between the two classes of corporations could be suggested except that the state did not want to lose the revenue and did not have the jurisdiction to tax the income of the nonresident stockholders.</SPAN></P>

The Commission held that the corporation had not established a nexus in Washington and was not entitled to apportion its income between Washington and Oregon.

Those activities and transactions were definitely engaged in for the pursuit of gain and constituted &quot;doing business&quot; as required by Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal government owned a lodge in a national forest. The private for-profit corporation agreed to run the lodge and a ski lift. The state tax assessor taxed the permit. The corporation argued that it was constitutionally exempt from state or county ad valorem taxation as an instrumentality of the United States. In the alternative, if not constitutionally tax exempt, the corporation contended that it was not taxable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.060 because it did not own the fee title to the property. Finally, if it was taxable, the corporation claimed that the state erroneously determined the value of its interests in the property. The court held that: (1) the government's control and need for the operation of lodge did not merge the corporation with the government for state tax purposes; (2) the corporation was subject to state and local ad valorem property taxes; (3) the corporation's interest in the lodge was a possessory interest taxable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.060; (4) both parties erred in determining the fair market value of the corporation's interest; therefore, the court remanded the case for the state to value the property in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the Act exempted it from Oregon corporate income taxation.

In its analysis the court found that 1) the taxpayer's activities met the statutory requirements for exemption; and 2) Congress' use of the due process concept as a definition in the Act was not an unconstitutional attempt by Congress to regulate due process. Nevertheless, the Act was an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional power to regulate interstate commerce because it prohibited net income tax that was not a burden on interstate commerce; rather, it apportioned to Oregon and the tax imposed thereon was not part of interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their Oregon tax return, the taxpayers declared an Oregon source gross income of $ 7,241.48, derived from a trust of real property in Oregon. Their only non-Oregon source income amounted to $ 52.42 in interest on a California savings account. They claimed nonbusiness deductions for medical expenses, interest paid on loans in California, union dues, bank fees, car insurance, and telephone expenses in the amount of $ 4,041.60. The Commission disallowed the deductions to the taxpayers as nonresidents because the expenses were not &quot;connected with&quot; Oregon source income as required by ORS 316.360 (Oregon). The court rejected the taxpayers' assertion that the phrase &quot;connected with&quot; Oregon source income did not require any direct connection between the claimed expense and the Oregon source income. The plain meaning of ORS 316.360 required a direct connection between the creation of Oregon source income and the claimed deduction and that the expense be incurred to produce the taxpayers' Oregon source income. That the claimed expenses may have been paid with Oregon source income was too indirect and tenuous a connection to support their deduction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State threatened to condemn an 18 acre strip of the taxpayers' farm as right-of-way for the construction of an interstate. The condemned strip separated about 1,000 acres of the taxpayers' land from the remaining 150 acres, upon which all the farm buildings and maintenance facilities were situated. The State represented to the taxpayers that a substantial amount of the price to be paid for the condemned land was for severance damages to the remaining land. When the taxpayers sought segregation of the consideration between land and damages, the highway agents refused, but the taxpayers reported the land's purchase price on their tax returns as the reasonable value of the land and treated the remainder of the award as damages to the remaining land. The tax commission assessed a deficiency against the taxpayers on the basis that the entire amount they received was the purchase price of the land taken. In the instant action to set aside the commission's determination, the court determined that the parol evidence rule did not preclude an allocation of the lump sum award between land price and damages because the taxpayers sought merely to explain the agreement, not to alter it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed decisions from defendant Oregon State Tax Commission, which held in favor the Commission in the taxpayers' action to set aside orders sustaining an additional assessment of income tax for the year in question. The additional assessment arose from a condemnation award for farm land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers reported as the purchase price the highest value placed upon the land by valuation witnesses and treated the remainder of the award as damages to the remaining severed lands. The Commission asserted that the capital gain was the difference between the basis and the total award. The court reversed. The court was not bound by federal law. The first and determinative question was whether the orders were a proper interpretation of state law. The parol evidence rule had no application because the evidence showed that substantial severance damage occurred in fact. The taxpayers were not required to obtain a special jury finding that segregated damages before they could obtain an allocation of the award for tax purposes. Moreover, decisional law clearly discouraged taxpayers from seeking such findings. An inference that portions of the awards were for damages was justified by the fact that the awards were substantially in excess of the highest testimony as to the land values. The damages were at least equal to the difference between the highest land value for which there was supporting testimony and the total award. This was the amount properly claimed by the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation sought review of the decision of the State Tax Commission (Oregon), which assessed corporate taxes, interest, and penalties upon its estimate of the corporation's net income earned from refrigerated railroad cars that were leased to bailees and that traveled to, into, and through Oregon. The corporation argued that it was not subject to such income taxation based on the mere presence of its property in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was not qualified to do business in Oregon, it maintained no office there, it had no employees there, it solicited no business there, and it had no direct contractual arrangements with any railroad that operated there. The corporation owned refrigerated railroad cars that it leased to railroads, and the cars were delivered to lessees at junction points outside of Oregon. The corporation collected a fixed rate per mile of use. The corporation had no control over the routing, movement, interchange, or other use of its cars by its lessees. Although the corporation paid property tax on all of its railroad cars that were located in Oregon on the first day of each year as the result of their lessees' business, the corporation contended that the mere presence of its property in the state was insufficient to subject it to state income tax. The court agreed, and it set aside the Commission's decision and its assessment of income tax. The court found that the corporation's liability for property tax did not create, ipso facto, liability for income tax. The benefits conferred by the state in return for the property tax were not sufficient to support income tax liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sought an order setting aside defendant state tax commission's order confirming a deficiency assessment of additional income taxes for the calendar year 1958.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was acting in the course of his business as a rancher when he shot and killed his brother-in-law, an adjoining landowner who refused to allow the taxpayer to use an established easement to access his field. The taxpayer was acquitted of a murder charge. On his 1958 tax return, the taxpayer deducted as a business expense $ 22,864 in attorneys' fees and expenses paid in connection with his defense against the murder charge. The commission denied the deduction and assessed a deficiency, and the taxpayer brought an action to set the assessment aside. The court entered a decree abating the assessment and holding that the fees and expenses were deductible under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.305(1) because they were reasonable in amount and bore a reasonable and proximate relation to the taxpayer's business. The court held that the presumption of the validity of the assessment was overcome by contrary factual evidence. The commission offered no evidence on the standard of conduct within the county in road disputes, while the taxpayer offered evidence that he acted reasonably by establishing his legal position and exhausting other remedies before using self-help to access his field.</SPAN></P>
