</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court of McDowell County (West Virginia) certified questions to reexamine the doctrine of sovereign immunity as it related to the State and county boards of education, growing out of a dispute involving the misapplication of funds raised by a special county election, intended to supplement the wages of county non-teaching school employees. The employees brought a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court, which denied relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county voters approved a school levy to supplement the monthly wages of county school employees. The board paid the supplement to eligible non-teaching employees until a State bill established a minimum pay scale for auxiliary and service employees of county schools. The board then ceased paying non-teaching employees the supplement. The court held that the board improperly treated two classes of employees differently. The board continued to pay teaching employees a supplement even when their salaries were also increased by the legislature. Such a difference in treatment was not permissible. The board had no discretion in the expenditure of the levy funds and thus was required to pay the monthly supplements to the non-teaching employees. The board was not entitled to assert the protection of sovereign immunity, and therefore, the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear the claim. The State board's involvement was as a third-party defense. The circuit court of a county other than Kanawha County lacked jurisdiction to hear claims naming a state agency or official. However, McDowell County had jurisdiction over the employees' complaint against the county board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered the certified questions and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

After that election was concluded, each was found guilty by a jury of making a false return of the result of the votes cast for a candidate at an election in violation of W.Va. Code &sect; 3-9-1. Thereafter, the trial court entered judgments of conviction and sentenced defendants to identical terms of imprisonment. On appeal, defendants asserted that there was a material variance in the allegations in the indictment and the proof adduced at trial, that the trial juries were unconstitutionally selected and empanelled, and that the trial court erred in not conducting an evidentiary hearing with respect to the selection of the jurors. The court determined that the errors alleged by defendant lacked merit, and it affirmed the trial court judgments of conviction. Notably, the court held that the proof presented by the state that defendants counted votes which they knew to have been fraudulently cast, recording those votes as lawful, and signed a certification that the return was true, operated to comply with &sect; 3-9-1's requirements for a conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Marion County (West Virginia), which denied his motion to set aside a verdict and award him a new trial, and convicted him of conspiracy to commit robbery under W. Va. Code, 61-10-31(1) (West Virginia).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the indictment failed to state an offense under the statute. In addition, defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Under the statute, it was unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to commit any offense against the state if one or more of such persons committed any act to effect the object of the conspiracy. The court determined that the statute was a general conspiracy statute. In addition, robbery was a common law felony for which punishment was provided. Therefore, the court held that the indictment properly charged defendant with the crime. The court determined that a criminal statute must have been set out with sufficient definiteness to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct was prohibited by statute and to provide adequate standards for adjudication. Because the terms of the statute were clear on their face and were of sufficient definiteness to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice, the statute was not vague. The court determined that the evidence was sufficient to support the guilty verdict and that the trial judge's actions failed to show bias against defendant.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect; 11-12A-1, et seq. (1967), against appellees, railway company, motor company, and barge corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court disagreed with circuit court decisions, and it reversed and remanded the cases. The barge company had no place of business, agents, or employees within the state and the circuit court determined that there was an insufficient nexus between the barge company and the state to support imposition of any tax. However, the court found that there was sufficient nexus between the parties to support the imposition of tax and that the tax in question was fairly apportioned, non-discriminatory, and fairly related to the services provided by the state. With respect to the additional assessment against the motor company that was both incorporated and located in the state, the court ruled that the commissioner's assessment, less penalty, was proper and taxed income derived only from the motor company's activities in state, thus it was fairly apportioned, not discriminatory, and fairly related to the services provided by the state. Finally, with respect to the assessment against the railway company, the court ruled that the railway company was liable for taxes on switching revenue under W.Va. Code &sect; 11-12A-2 (1967), as a business that began and ended in the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (West Virginia), which entered his conviction and sentence for the murder of a former county sheriff. On appeal, defendant assigned error in three areas: the trial court's refusal to grant a motion for a change of venue and its restriction of the scope of the voir dire, the security precautions allowed at trial, and the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for the murder of a former county sheriff, who was shot to death in the front yard of his home. The home had been forcibly entered and ransacked. Claiming a hostile sentiment existed in the community that affected his right to a fair and impartial jury panel, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a change of venue and in restricting the scope of voir dire. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in allowing certain security precautions at trial. Defendant also claimed that his motion to suppress the evidence was improperly denied. Because the trial court committed reversible error by absolutely refusing to inquire into any potential relationship between members of the jury panel and law enforcement agencies or personnel, the appellate court reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that it was an abuse of discretion to so limit a litigant's ability to determine whether the jurors were free from interest, bias, or prejudice. Although the case was reversed on that ground only, the appellate court addressed the other issues raised on appeal that merited discussion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the lower court abused its discretion in limiting the scope of voir dire in derogation of defendant's due process rights, the judgment of conviction was reversed. The case was remanded for a new trial in accordance with the principles set forth in the court's opinion in which the court considered the other issues raised on the appeal that merited discussion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mining company filed an action in the lower court against the environmental groups charging them with libeling the mining company and damaging its commercial interests through a series of communications the environmental groups made to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Surface Mining. After the lower court denied their motion to dismiss, the environmental groups sought a writ of prohibition contending that the lower court's ruling constituted a substantial legal error in contravention of the constitutional mandate guaranteeing the rights of petition and of freedom of speech, and that prohibition would lie to restrain the enforcement of the ruling. The court found merit in the environmental groups' arguments and awarded the writ as prayed for. The court held that the communications made by the environmental groups appeared to be classic examples of absolutely privileged petitioning activity. The court further declined to adopt a malice standard for invoking the sham exception under federal and state constitutional provisions.

Appellant sought review, the trial court affirmed the adverse decision, and appellant again challenged that determination. The court reversed, holding that although &sect; 21A-6-3(6) was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality, it was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection principles by imposing a classification that did not bear a reasonable relationship to a proper governmental purpose. Because the statute improperly created an irrebutable presumption that a claimant who quit to perform a marital duty had permanently withdrawn from the workforce, the court determined that instead &sect; 21A-6-3(6) should create a rebuttable presumption of permanent withdrawal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court consolidated three cases to determine rights of petitioner illegitimate children to inherit from their fathers. W. Va. Code &sect; 42-1-5 limited the children's inheritance rights to their mothers' estates, but its constitutionality was questioned against the federal and state Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In determining the constitutionality of W. Va. Code &sect; 42-1-5, the court found that equal protection was violated by a statute that denied an illegitimate child intestacy rights in his or her father's estate. Characteristics of classes that made them suspect and subject to strict scrutiny under the equal protection clause were conditions of birth, history of past discrimination, political powerlessness. The court determined that a status of illegitimacy fit those criteria because the children acquired that label through no fault of their own as a condition of birth and profound legal and political disabilities, of which &sect; 42-1-5 was an example, had occurred. The court held that &sect; 42-1-5 exhibited a legislative intent to permit illegitimate children to inherit, but it was too narrowly drawn. The court concluded that neutral extension applied and &sect; 42-1-5 was required to be applied to permit illegitimate children to inherit from both father and mother.</SPAN></P>

The oil companies filed a petition for writ of mandamus seeking to compel the state officials to grant the necessary permit. The trial court denied the petition. On appeal, the oil companies contended that the consent requirements violated the federal and state constitutions by impairing the obligation of contracts extant prior to the enactment of the consent requirements and by taking without due process of law. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) where the oil and gas companies acquired a one-half interest in the oil and gas prior to the enactment of the consent requirements and the remaining one-half thereafter, the lease did not pre-date the consent requirements; and (2) thus the consent requirements did not unconstitutionally impair the obligations of contract or constitute a taking without due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant juvenile challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Lincoln County (West Virginia), which transferred appellant from juvenile jurisdiction to the lower court's criminal jurisdiction pursuant to W.

Appellant argued that a transfer hearing was not timely and that the lower court did not make a finding concerning appellant's suitability for rehabilitative treatment under the juvenile laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile referee held a probable cause hearing at which the State introduced evidence that appellant had cooperated with two adults in a murder. The referee found probable cause to believe that appellant committed the crime. The lower court later granted a motion to transfer. The court affirmed. W. Va. Code, 49-5-10(a) (1978) provided that a transfer hearing had to be held within seven days of a filing of a motion unless it was continued for good cause. In this case, the court found such good cause since W. Va. Code, 49-5-10(a) (1978) also provided that before a court may conduct a transfer hearing, there had to be reasonable notice to the child, the parents, and the child's counsel. Had a continuance not been granted, all parties would not have been adequately prepared. Next, the court held that when there was probable cause to believe a juvenile had committed a crime specified in W. Va. Code, 49-5-10(d)(1), a court may transfer the juvenile to the court's criminal jurisdiction without further inquiry. In this instance, the lower court did more than required; it examined appellant's personal background and heard witnesses concerning appellant's physical and mental status.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original mandamus proceeding, relator sought to have the freeholder eligibility requirement for membership on respondent city's planning commission declared unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection principles. This provision was found in W. Va. Code, 8-24-5, and a similar provision was contained in &sect; 151.01 of the Code of the City of Wheeling (West Virginia).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator argued that a freeholder requirement for holding office on public boards violated equal protection concepts. The court noted that the equal protection guarantee contained in Article III, &sect; 17 of the West Virginia Constitution paralleled that of the Fourteenth Amendment. If a fundamental or constitutional right was involved, then the state's attempt to classify such right must be based on a compelling state interest. If the right did not rise to a constitutional or fundamental level, the state had to only show a rational connection to sustain its classification. Using the latter test, the court looked at the functions of a planning commission, finding it was engaged in a multitude of projects relating to community planning and development. Thus, the court found that to limit its membership to a freeholder class was arbitrary and irrational. The city argued that a mandamus proceeding could not be used to challenge the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance since relator could have instituted a declaratory judgment action under W. Va. Code, 55-13-1, et seq. The court held mandamus could be used to attack the constitutionality or validity of a statute or ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court awarded relator a writ of mandamus directing the city to consider relator as eligible for appointment on the city's planning commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under a provision of the Retirement System for Judges, W. Va.

The judges sought a writ of mandamus compelling the auditor and the treasurer to issue and sign warrants paying them their increased retirement pay. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting the writ. Under the escalator provisions of &sect; 51-9-6, the judges were initially entitled to pension increases when the sitting judges received pay increases. However, under &sect; 51-9-6c, the legislature attempted to freeze the pension benefits and make them dependent upon the salaries of active justices and judges prior to January 1, 1979. The court held that &sect; 51-9-6c was unconstitutional as a law impairing the obligations of contract in violation U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Although the opinion touched upon questions affecting the retirement of members of the court, the common law rule of necessity commanded that the court hear the case because there was no forum available that would not have had a remote pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate, represented by court appointed counsel at trial, was convicted of first degree murder upon entry of his guilty plea.

The court reversed and remanded, finding that the inmate had alleged some claims which, if true, would entitle him to relief. The court found that his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel was unlikely to have been raised at the trial or appellate stage, and that the plea bargain issue would not have been raised if counsel were ineffective. The court held that rules such as res judicata, which prevented consideration of the merits of a post-conviction claim should be applied with caution, and that a person seeking habeas corpus was entitled to a full and fair opportunity, with assistance of effective counsel, to litigate all issues.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was denied unemployment compensation benefits by the department of employment security, which decision was affirmed by the trial court. The claimant had been suspended from employment as a bath house attendant and was a union member. After receiving a letter of suspension, the claimant demanded arbitration. The arbitrator decided that the claimant was to be reinstated to his employment, where work was available and subject to the claimant being able to pass a physical examination normally given to any new employee. The state then found him ineligible but not disqualified to receive unemployment benefits, which was affirmed by the trial examiner. The claimant contended that he was totally unemployed during the suspension period within the meaning of the state unemployment compensation law and, thus, entitled to unemployment benefits. The court reversed and held that conditional reinstatement, where the claimant performed no work and no wages were paid to him, made him &quot;otherwise separated from employment&quot; under W. Va.

He contended that regulations unduly restricted the hours during which attorneys could visit inmates.

The court issued the writ and concluded that the regulations regarding the search of attorneys was invalid, that the penitentiary was required to alter the visiting hours, and that the construction of three interior rooms for attorney conferences was necessary. In the absence of any specific facts or incidents where attorneys attempted improper activity in a prison, it was presumed that attorneys did not engage in conduct that jeopardized prison security. The state failed to sustain its burden of proof to show the necessity of warrantless pat-down search of attorneys. Respondent conceded that visiting hours between eight to five was a reasonable period and that special circumstances could occur that could warrant visitation of attorneys outside of the regular hours.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed finding that, because the evidence indicated one continuing sexual offense over the course of about 15 minutes and culminating in sexual intercourse, the jury should have been instructed that they could find the defendant guilty of only one of the following in descending order of severity: sexual assault in the second degree, sexual abuse in the first degree, sexual misconduct, or assault and battery. Although sexual misconduct could have been a lesser included offense of sexual assault in the second degree, there was sufficient distinction between the two offenses that they constituted separate offenses because sexual misconduct excluded the possibility of forcible compulsion and required a lack of consent. The jury's verdict could have been interpreted as a determination that the victim did not consent to have intercourse, hence the verdict of guilty of sexual misconduct, but did not resist strenuously enough to have been a victim of forcible compulsion, hence not guilty of sexual assault in second degree and assault and battery.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect;&sect; 61-11-18 and 61-1-19, by a trial court (West Virginia) violated the proportionality clause in W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator was 18 years old when he was indicted for forging a check under $ 20. After pleading guilty, he was sentenced and placed on probation. Four years later, he pled guilty to arson for burning a barn, which resulted in the revocation of his probation and the imposition of the original sentence for forgery. He was also sentenced for burning the barn and for burning the hay in the barn. Subsequently, he was paroled, but his parole was revoked shortly thereafter when he was found guilty of driving a vehicle without a license. He served three years in the penitentiary and was again paroled. A year later, he was found guilty of forging a $ 43 check and was then given a recidivist life sentence under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-11-18. The court held that the imposition of the life recidivist sentence for relator's third felony of forging a $ 43 check violated the constitutional proportionality principle under W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5. The court noted that there was no rational argument that justified the recidivist sentence in light of the nonviolent nature of relator's crimes. The court noted that relator received almost the maximum punishment for his prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended, among other things, that the circuit court erred in holding the 1978 amendments to the juvenile law applicable to the transfer hearing as well as to subsequent proceedings and in admitting prior testimony of several witnesses. He also contended that the 1978 amendments to the juvenile law were unconstitutional in that they violated due process requirements. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that W. Va. Code &sect; 49-5-10 (Supp. 1978), governing the transfer of juvenile proceedings to criminal jurisdiction, applied only to those juvenile cases where the alleged criminal act was committed after the effective date of the 1978 amendments. Thus, the circuit court committed prejudicial error in applying &sect; 49-5-10 to the transfer proceeding in defendant's case. The court held further that the circuit court erroneously admitted the prior testimony of a State's witness because the State did not lay a proper foundation for such testimony.</SPAN></P>

Code 63.1-225 underlying a Virginia decree that permitted a second husband to adopt defendant former wife's child over the objection of plaintiff former husband, the natural father, could be attacked under full faith and credit principles. The circuit court denied the wife's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband had notice of the adoption and appeared in the Virginia court to object to the proceedings. He did not appeal the Virginia court's decision. When the wife and her second husband moved back to West Virginia, the husband petitioned the circuit court to modify his visitation rights. The wife filed a motion for summary judgment based on the full faith and credit clause. The circuit court accepted the husband's position that a West Virginia court was not entitled to give full faith and credit to a foreign decree if the decree was predicated on an unconstitutional statute. The circuit court found that the Virginia statute was constitutionally vague because it utilized the general standard &quot;contrary to the best interests of the child&quot; in cutting off the parental rights of a natural parent. Upon review, the court found that the because the asserted unconstitutionality of the Virginia statute on which the judgment was based went to the merits of the action, rather than the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment, it could not be raised collaterally in West Virginia.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 7-14-15(a) (1971), was not overly vague or broad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deputy was discharged pursuant to the Act for unlawful political activity. After hearings before the Civil Service Commission, the deputy was ordered dismissed, finding that he had been regularly present in the campaign headquarters of a sheriff candidate during a primary election, that he attended at least one political dinner during the campaign, and that he transported and distributed campaign literature during the campaign. The deputy argued that W.Va. Code &sect; 7-14-15(a) (1971) denied his constitutional right to free political expression because it was both vague and impermissibly broad in scope. The court found that &sect; 7-14-15(a) was overly broad because it appeared to proscribe activities which the United States Supreme Court had indicated were protected by U.S. Const. amend. I even with respect to a sheriff deputy, who was an employee of a classified civil service. However, the court refused to strike down &sect; 7-14-15(a) in its entirety and, instead, cured &sect; 7-14-15(a) by judicial construction. Specifically, the court interpreted &sect; 7-14-15(a) to proscribe only those political activities, which the United States Supreme Court had decided were constitutionally proscribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was nothing contained in the record by way of presentence reports or a transcript of the sentencing hearing that would indicate on what factual basis the particular terms of the sentences were fixed. In remanding the case to the trial court to permit a sentencing record to be developed, the court announced new guidelines and procedures for review of a sentence for robbery by violence. The statutory sentence for robbery by violence, W. Va. Code, 61-2-12, provided that upon conviction a defendant was to be confined in the penitentiary not less than ten years. The court declined to declare the punishment provisions of the armed robbery statute per se unconstitutional as violating the cruel and unusual punishment provisions of West Virginia's Constitution, Article III, &sect; 5 of West Virginia's Constitution. Where a defendant desired to challenge the length of his sentence for robbery by violence, he was entitled to do so by a timely motion to the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with murdering four persons, three of whom were killed in a bedroom and the fourth in a hallway. The trial court declined to give a unitary trial for the four murder charges. Defendant was brought to trial on one of the charges and was convicted of first-degree murder. A trial date was set for the next murder trial, and defendant sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial on the basis that jeopardy had attached, and further trials were precluded. The court denied the writ of prohibition. The court held that if two persons were killed by the single volitive act of another, such homicides would be treated as a single transaction for jeopardy purposes. However, there was no contention that the multiple homicides for which defendant was charged occurred as a result of a single volitive act; rather, each was killed by sequential acts of defendant, who moved from one victim to another, striking them with a tire lug wrench. Even though the multiple homicides were in close proximity in time, they were not the result of a single volitive act of defendant and could be tried and punished separately under the double jeopardy clause of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial defendant filed a writ of mandamus with the court to compel the auditor to pay an advanced retainer of $ 1,000 to a ballistics expert whose attendance was required at the trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee claimed he had been suspended for 30 days and transferred, because he testified before a legislative committee. The DNR asserted that the Commission did not have the authority to hear his complaint, because W. Va.

The Commission argued that it had power to hear the complaint under the rules it had enacted, pursuant to its authority under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 29-6-1, 29-6-10, to promulgate rules to effectuate the state's civil service system statute. On appeal, the court agreed with the Commission's arguments. Further, the court noted that the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4701, et seq., indicated that state and local governments that wished to qualify for federal funds had to ensure fair treatment for employees consistent with federal merit principles. Those principles would permit employees to appeal all discriminatory treatment. The court held that the legislature had not violated the principles, in W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 and art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One commissioner's wife was a was a deputy assessor, and the other was an employee of the West Virginia University Extension Service. The commissioners argued that the university employee was an auxiliary or service employee under W.Va. Code, 1931, 61-10-15, as amended, and that there was no conflict of interest as a result. Affirming, the court rejected that argument, ruling that an auxiliary employee worked for the public schools, which were elementary or secondary schools, not universities. The court also explained that the statute was constitutional and that the court had no power to extend the statute to the instant situation. Accordingly, the court concluded that the circuit court's findings of misconduct were not clearly wrong and that the commissioners had violated W.Va. Code, 1931, 61-10-15, as amended, by voting for the wives' salaries. That statute was enacted to implement the state's public policy prohibiting public officers from becoming pecuniarily interested, directly or indirectly, in the proceeds of any contracts in which they had a voice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was tried and convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment with mercy. No appeal was taken from that conviction. He later filed a habeas corpus petition in the court, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. A writ issued and was made returnable to the trial court, where counsel was appointed. Petitioner's counsel filed a second habeas corpus petition particularizing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim by alleging thirty-six acts or omissions on the part of the original counsel. The trial court denied relief, and counsel filed the motion to reverse under the Post-Conviction Habeas Corpus Act. The court reversed because the charge given by the trial court improperly shifted the burden of proof. The proscription against unconstitutionally shifting the burden of proof in criminal trials from the State to a defendant through the use of presumptions was fully retroactive and may have been raised by collateral attack against a final conviction. In addition, the trial court erred in requiring petitioner to institute an entirely new proceeding to raise a purely legal question.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator by writ sought to prohibit respondent, a circuit court judge from trying him for murder. His reasons were that a single trial enforcing W. Va. Code, 62-3-15, violated his state and federal constitutional rights to due process and equal protection by failing to provide standards for the jury's choice to grant mercy, and contravenes his constitutional protections against self-incrimination and cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that there should be a trial to determine guilt, and if he was found guilty, another to decide his sentence. In dealing with standards for imposition of the death sentence, the court intimated no view regarding the authority of a State or of the Congress to fix mandatory, minimum sentences for noncapital crimes. The court held that mandatory life sentences in noncapital cases do not violate the Constitution. A life sentence, with or without possibility of parole, was not a cruel and unusual punishment unless so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the general conscience or degrade human dignity. Although life imprisonment without eligibility for parole was the severest penalty in West Virginia, first-degree murder was a most heinous crime. The court on appeal also held that Code, 62-3-15 was not unconstitutional because it permitted a single trial procedure, rather than a bifurcated one. The court could not conceive of any fact that defendant could introduce to convince a jury that he deserved mercy at a separate sentencing stage, that should not be introduced by him at the main trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient contended that the evidence did not prove, as required by W.Va.

The patient argued that the statute required that the likelihood that one would cause harm to himself or others be imminent and a substantial danger. The patient's treating physician testified that the patient could be dangerous if he came into contact with certain persons and believed they were trying to harm him. The court held that the commissioner was correct in committing the patient to the state hospital. The court held that proof in an involuntary commitment proceeding did not need to be beyond a reasonable doubt, but it had to be clear, cogent, and convincing. Further, a patient could be dangerous in only certain types of situations or in relationships with certain individuals. An evaluation of dangerousness had to take into account the likelihood that the patient would be exposed to such situations or come into contact with such individuals. Here, there was sufficient evidence to prove clearly and convincingly that the patient was likely to be a danger to himself or others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city manager challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), awarding a writ of mandamus to appellee, the City of Charleston, which ordered the manager to comply with certain directions of the city council. The manager asked the court to set aside the writ, claiming that compliance with the order would run contrary to principles of the fundamental law of West Virginia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a &quot;Class I&quot; city with a population in excess of 50,000, Charleston was authorized under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 8-16-1, 8-16-2 to construct public meeting facilities and to issue revenue bonds to pay for them. Under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 8-13-3, 8-16-18a Charleston chose to levy hotel room occupancy tax to repay bonds issued fund construction of convention facilities. The city council directed the manager to contract for an analysis of the amount of bonds that could be funded by the hotel occupancy tax to finance the development of proposed convention facilities. The manager refused to execute the contract, but the circuit court ordered him to. The court reversed, finding that the legislative classification granting such taxing authority only to Class I cities was not reasonable or appropriate to the legislative purpose of promoting tourism and economic development. The court saw no rational reason to restrict the benefits of the tax to Class I cities and deny such opportunity to smaller municipalities. Under W. Va. Const. art. 6, &sect; 39, if one municipality was to be given the authority to tax in order to further civic development, all municipalities had to be given that authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate requested writs of prohibition and mandamus. Petitioner contended that the revocation of an order, which acquitted him subjected him to double jeopardy, and that the circuit court abused its power and acted without jurisdiction when it revoked its acquittal judgment. Defendant was convicted of burglary. After a motion for a new trial was granted, he was retried, and convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reviewed the recent spate of double jeopardy decisions by the United States Supreme Court. The court held that a defendant who challenged a conviction by appeal or post-verdict motion voluntarily subjected himself to reconsideration of matters that involve jeopardy to his liberty. By so choosing, defendant waived his double jeopardy rights. If the State had been statutorily entitled to appeal the August 29 order in question, reversal would not offend the double jeopardy provision, even if it resulted in reinstatement of a jury verdict of guilty. The court on appeal held that the reversal by a circuit court itself therefore did not offend double jeopardy principles. The other issue for the court was regarding the jurisdiction of a trial court to vacate, modify or set aside its order of acquittal. The circuit court could set aside its judgment within the same term of court if defendant had not, and had not when the judgment was overruled, &quot;satisfied in whole or in part&quot; such judgment. In this case, defendant had a brief respite from his conviction, but no increase in the penalty when the court simply reinstated the jury's finding of guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The writs of prohibition and mandamus were denied, and petitioner was remanded to the penitentiary to serve his sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the writ but found that the statute created an unconstitutional shift in the burden of proof. The statute required proof of an intention to convert the property or deprive the owner of merchandise. The statute was unconstitutional because it made the act of concealment prima facie evidence that there was an intention to convert. The court found that proof of concealment could not prove the mens rea or the definition of shoplifting would be changed from concealment with intent to convert to simply concealment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had previously murdered one victim and severely wounded another during a robbery. His plea to first-degree murder required the prosecutor to nolle the robbery indictments. When defendant became eligible for parole 11 years later, he was indicted for malicious wounding arising out of the same crime. The court acknowledged that there was no statute of limitations and that the federal courts had held that claims of denial of constitutional speedy trial rights did not rise until the defendant was arrested or indicted. However, the court held that it was not limited to federal law or Sixth Amendment rights because West Virginia had its own state due process and speedy trial provisions in W. Va. Const. art. 3, &sect;&sect; 10, 14. The court granted the writ of prohibition, holding that defendant's due process protections encompassed the right to have the government accuse him of a crime within a reasonable time from discovery of its commission and its determination that defendant committed the act. The court remanded, ruling that the passage of 11 years infringed upon defendant's constitutional right to due process of law absent proof that the state acted with reasonable diligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">W. Va. Code &sect; 13-2C-1 et seq. authorized counties and cities to issue revenue bonds for commercial projects.

Const. art X, &sect; 8, which set limits on a county's bonded indebtedness. The court held that the statutes did not violate the state constitution. The court reasoned that the revenue bonds were not indebtedness within the meaning intended in the constitution because they did not impose an obligation on the issuing authority to redeem the bonds from tax revenues, but instead provided that the bond was to be liquidated from the proceeds of the commercial venture. The court further held that the project fulfilled the constitutional criteria of having a rational basis and meeting a public purpose because it would provide jobs and stimulate the county economy.

Second, the subdivision allowed under regulations under Va. Code &sect;&sect; 8-24-28 through 35 (1969) were distinguishable from zoning ordinances. The developers' plat fully complied with the vague subdivision regulations that the county had enacted in Jefferson County, W. Va., Subdivision Regulations art.

The court held that the charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquors could not have been sustained against defendant because the state was unable to show that defendant was drunk while on a street or highway. The court found that W. Va.

The circuit court ruled that the executrix and the trustee of a testamentary trust could not enter into a trust termination agreement to modify the testamentary trust, which was declared void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court held that a trust provision, which continued the trust for 25 years after the testatrix's death or until the principal was reduced to less than $ 5,000, violated the rule against perpetuities and was therefore void. The court determined that the testatrix's general intention was to provide funds for education of her husband's nieces, nephews, and their families. This general intention did not contravene the rule. The testatrix's particular intention, to have the trust continue for 25 years after her death or until the principal was less than $ 5,000, did violate the rule against perpetuities. The court adopted a doctrine of equitable modification and held that, if four conditions were met, any non-charitable devise or bequest which violated the rule against perpetuities would be modified. The testamentary disposition before the court fulfilled the conditions. Therefore, the court ordered that the will should be equitably modified to reduce the duration of the trust from 25 years to 21 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found in criminal contempt for conspiring with his son to remove the son's child from the state in violation of a custody order. He alleged that his rights were violated when the trial court denied his demand for a jury trial. He argued that W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 14 afforded an absolute right to a jury trial for all crimes and misdemeanors. He also contended that criminal contempt was a crime and therefore he should have been afforded a jury trial. On appeal, the court held that the constitution mandated a jury trial in a criminal contempt where a jail sentence could be imposed without the right of immediate release by purging oneself. The court determined that &sect; 14 prohibited imprisonment without a jury trial in a criminal contempt proceeding where defendant was sentenced and the sentencing order did not provide him an opportunity to purge the contempt. However, the court concluded that defendant's right to a jury trial did not apply where the sentencing order contained the condition that defendant could gain immediate release by purging himself of the contempt by performing an act that was within his power to accomplish.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and codefendants, who testified against defendant, broke and entered a store and stole 16 guns. Three of the guns were recovered. Codefendants testified that defendant had attempted to sell the other 13 guns. Defendant argued that his conviction was based on the testimony of accomplices and that he was denied the conventional cautionary instruction as to their testimony, that his identity was improperly proved at the recidivist trial, and that his life sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury a cautionary instruction on accomplice testimony because there was other evidence that corroborated the accomplices' testimony. The court also declined to apply the proportionality doctrine of the W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5 because the crime of breaking and entering carried the potentiality of violence and danger to life as well as to property. Additionally, the court found that two officers' identification testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because of the independent identification testimony of the other witnesses, which was substantial and uncontradicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant had completed a course at a duly licensed and approved school of barbering, and she successfully passed the state competency test. She was licensed as a junior barber and was required under W. Va. Code &sect; 30-27-3 to serve a one-year apprenticeship in order to become a fully qualified barber. When she could not find employment as a junior barber, the applicant sought a writ of mandamus directing the members of the Board to license her as a fully qualified barber. The court granted the writ because the apprenticeship requirement of &sect; 30-27-3 bore no reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. The court held that the imposition of a required apprenticeship had no rational relationship to a legitimate state concern. The court noted that the most critical defect was the lack of any standard against which competence acquired as an apprentice could be measured. There was no examination or guideline by which a junior barber was to be evaluated during the apprenticeship. The court noted that the licensing procedure left it with the impression that it was designed more to restrain trade than to protect the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Complex litigation ensued after a cooling tower collapsed, killing 51 men. Twenty civil actions were pending in the Circuit Court of Pleasants County. Seven similar actions were filed in the Circuit Court of Wood County, which subsequently transferred those cases to Pleasants County. The court denied the writ of prohibition. The court first addressed whether an issue of the type in the instant case could be reached by a writ of prohibition. The adequacy of a remedy by appeal was wholly theoretical and not at all practical. Because there was no inconsistency between W. Va. Code &sect; 56-9-1 (1939), which provided that a party could move a circuit court in which an action was pending to transfer it to any other circuit if good cause was shown, and W. Va. R. Civ. P. 42b, which allowed the court in which the first of two or more related actions was pending to order all actions transferred to it, the court concluded that the Circuit Court of Wood County had jurisdiction to transfer the cases and that in so doing the court did not abuse its discretion. Further, the litigants were not put to any significant increased expense or aggravation in prosecuting their claim in Pleasants County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After reviewing the current rules that applied to state taxation of activities in interstate commerce, the court summarized the principles that the taxpayer must demonstrate discrimination, that no state could tax local transactions involving products manufactured in any other state at a higher rate than similar local activities, that determination of the legitimacy of a tax should be based on three functional criteria, and that there was a difference between a direct tax borne by a commercial taxpayer and a use tax borne by the customers. Applying these principles to the four cases, the court approved a tax on direct mail order sales serviced outside of the state. The court approved a tax on the fabrication and erection of certain structures in the state where the actual manufacture of the parts took place out of state. The court approved a tax upon a partnership of consulting engineers with its principal office located out of state on apportionment and fair relationship to services. Finally, the court approved the use tax statute,&nbsp;W. Va.

Appellants alleged that appellees had unlawfully failed to include in the budget for the school year 1976-1977 a local supplement of $ 500 to the State minimum salary for teachers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to appellants' claim that appellees had unlawfully failed to include in the budget a local supplement to the minimum salary for teachers, appellees asserted that they were not required to pay the supplement because inflation, an event beyond their control, made it impossible for them to meet all their educational obligations. According to an employee of the West Virginia Department of Education, the schools were struggling financially. In the fiscal year 1976-77, when the supplements were canceled, the Board of Education appropriated no money for capital expenditures, and made cuts in administration costs, maintenance, teaching supplies, and textbooks. The attempt to save money was offset by an increase in the minimum teachers' salary and an increase in transportation costs. The trial court awarded judgment for appellees. On appeal, the court found that the phrase &quot;events over which it had no control&quot; in W. Va. Code &sect; 18A-4-5 (1969) was included to allow for any unforeseeable event which could destroy a rational budget. Since inflation had become an event beyond anyone's control, the denial of the supplements was within the authority of the school board.</SPAN></P>

On the day of the homicide, the victim was shot twice by defendant in the hallway of their apartment building following a brief argument. At the first and second trials, the principal defense was insanity. On appeal, defendant raised a claim of surprise resulting from the introduction of a written confession and the further assertion that it was involuntary. The confession was not introduced in the first trial and was not disclosed to the defense attorney until after the commencement of the second trial. The court held that it was error to deprive defendant of an opportunity to produce psychiatric testimony at the in camera hearing to show that the confession was not voluntary as he was probably insane at the time he gave it. Also, the State's failure to rebut the defendant's insanity beyond a reasonable doubt resulted in an evidentiary insufficiency, which barred retrial under double jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in telling him that if he testified the state could attack his character.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state alleged that defendant forcibly raped the victim. He did not testify at trial. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in telling him that if he testified the state could attack his character. The court ruled that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to properly inform him that his credibility could have been impeached by prior convictions of perjury or false swearing, and that prior convictions could be used to impeach his character if he had put his good character in issue. The court also concluded that the state's closing arguments improperly commented on defendant's failure to testify. The court held that the state's closing comments constituted reversible error. The court determined that the jury's verdict that defendant had committed forcible rape was not contrary to law, even if it was uncorroborated by evidence other than the victim's testimony. The court ruled that the victim's testimony alone was sufficient to sustain the conviction, and the victim's credibility was for the jury to determine, so a retrial was permitted if the state chose. The court reversed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Previously, the court found the method of paying justices of the peace unconstitutional because judicial officers had a pecuniary interest in the outcome of cases before them and this made the judgments unenforceable.

On review, the court consolidated the case and held that a retroactive application of the previous ruling would upset the thousands of judgments rendered in justice of the peace courts, a significant number of which probably were unpaid and are existing liens. The court affirmed the enforceability of judgments from the old justices' courts and reversed the decision finding the old judgments void ab initio.

The superintendent contended that the state troopers were outside the purview of the &sect; 21-5C-1-et seq., or, that if they were covered, that he was not liable for two years' back overtime wages because he had relied on a past ruling, which specifically excluded the state troopers from coverage under W.

The circuit court concluded that the superintendent was liable for two years of unpaid overtime wages. The court reversed, concluding that the &sect; 21-5C-8(d) was not to be applied retroactively. The court held that, until the overruling opinion, the superintendent could have reasonably relied on the holding under the previous decision that state troopers were not entitled to overtime compensation under W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance required that each candidate submit written evidence to the village council that he was bondable as a public official by an approved corporate surety company for the sum of $ 100,000. Although relator submitted a proper nomination petition, he failed to submit written evidence of his bondability 45 days prior to the election, and the village recorder refused to permit his name to appear on the ballot. The court held the bondability requirement to be void. W. Va. Const., art. 4 &sect; 8 established authority for the legislature to provide for terms of office, but did not provide for the establishment of qualifications for municipal office. Any qualification in excess of the constitutional provisions was void. Thus, the ordinance was void and unenforceable. Respondents contended that relator filed a similar mandamus action in a circuit court and was denied relief. Under the liberal mandamus procedure in election cases, relator was not foreclosed from filing his original mandamus in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. The factual issues considered in the circuit court were collateral to the legal issue of whether the bonding requirement could be imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the state and reversed the trial court's order. The court noted the gambling devices under &sect; 61-10-1 were not per se illegal. Therefore, the court held that due process required that the state prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property sought to be forfeited was used in an illegal manner. The court said that the trial court had jurisdiction to order destruction, but notice had to be given to those in who possession the machines were found, and a hearing had to be given to them, if they appeared and claimed ownership. The court said that the possessors had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the slot machines were kept or exhibited innocently, not for gambling purposes.

One petitioner was denied the right to repurchase a tract at a public sale, and the high bidder was denied land where other petitioners were given equitable relief and the board was required to execute a deed conveying the property to petitioners. The court was requested to determine the board's right to dispose of property in light of the repurchase statute. First, the court noted that the trial courts did not based their decisions on the dominate character of the community as a whole; thus, the cases were reversed and remanded to present additional evidence. Moreover, the court stated that the issue of whether any given community was &quot;rural,&quot; as set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 18-5-7, was a jury determination. However, the term &quot;rural&quot; was developed as connoting an area which was dominated by an agrarian style of life. The court looked to the legislative intent of W. Va.

He challenged the increased sentence he received in the circuit court as violative of his constitutional rights, and also objected to the trial being conducted in his absence. In affirming the circuit court's judgment in part and reversing it in part, the court held that defendant was denied due process under W. Va.

The lessees filed a motion with the circuit court judge to quash the orders. After a hearing, the circuit court judge denied the motion. The lessees filed a petition for a writ of prohibition against the circuit court judge. The court denied the lessees' petition. The court held that the prejudgment seizure procedure in the West Virginia detinue statute as written was unconstitutional because it failed to provide an opportunity for hearing before property was taken. However, the procedure was augmented when the circuit court judge gave a pre-seizure hearing on the lessees' motion to quash the attachment orders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a black man, appealed from the trial court (West Virginia) felony conviction for forcible rape of a white victim. He claimed that the trial court erred in denying defense counsels' motion for continuance, based on the fact that the trial court gave them only one weekend to prepare a defense, thereby denying him effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Constitutions of West Virginia and the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested in February 1975. In March a true bill was returned. Trial was set for April. Between February and April, two lawyers represented defendant at various hearings and, to avoid judicial wrath, appeared at trial but defendant did not retain either of them and neither was ever paid for his efforts. The morning of trial, they sought a continuance based on lack of preparation, as they had only the prior weekend to prepare although the case involved a possible life sentence. Since neither had been retained, neither had prepared for trial, had a copy of the indictment, prepared pretrial motions, interviewed defendant or any witness. Neither had prepared voir dire, statements, strategy, instructions, or other documents, nor requested a preliminary hearing transcript. The trial court summarily denied the motion and proceeded to trial. The record did not reveal what occurred on the day trial was set and contained no affidavit of indigency. The court reversed, finding the Eno principles were controlling; denial of a continuance under the circumstances was a denial of effective assistance of counsel. It was also an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was reversed. The trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance, denying defendant his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. The court was not prepared to hold that defendant failed to act with reasonable diligence in procuring counsel. The record disclosed no reason or justification for the haste in trying the case and the likelihood of prejudice was quite high.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding in mandamus, petitioner citizen sought to prohibit respondent judge of the Circuit Court, Cabell County (West Virginia) from trying him on the grounds of double jeopardy. The citizen claimed a second indictment for breaking and entering charged the same transaction as had been charged in a first indictment, which he had been acquitted of by directed verdict in the first trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the first trial, because the address of the building allegedly broken into and listed in the indictment was incorrect, it was found to be a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof, and the citizen's motion for directed verdict of acquittal was granted. The citizen was then indicted for breaking and entering again, but the indictment listed the correct address. The citizen argued that he was being tried a second time for the same offense in contravention of double jeopardy provisions. The court agreed and granted the writ. After a judgment acquitting a defendant, no retrial on the same offense was permissible no matter how erroneous the acquittal. The court adopted both the same evidence test and the same transaction test for determining whether the same offense was involved for double jeopardy purposes with the rule that whichever test afforded a defendant the greater protection against potential unconstitutional double jeopardy had to be applied. The court also held that W. Va. Code &sect; 61-11-14 (1923) was unconstitutional as it allowed multiple prosecutions of the same defendant for the same offense and expressly provided for a second prosecution after an acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents contended that W.Va. Code, 49-6-3 (West Virginia), under which their child was taken, was unconstitutional. The court discharged the writ of habeas corpus because the statute was constitutional on its face and because the issue of constitutionality as applied was moot where the child had been returned to the parents. The court noted that W.Va. Code, 49-6-3, allowed the removal of children for not more than 10 days, pending a preliminary hearing, if there was an imminent danger to the physical well-being of the child and there were no reasonably available alternatives to removal. The court determined that the statute satisfied due process and balanced the rights of the parents against the right of the State to protect children if it allowed emergency takings only where the welfare or life of the child was endangered and if there was an adjudication as soon as reasonably possible after the taking. Because the statute, when read with the other provisions of the West Virginia Child Welfare Act, satisfied both of these requirements, the court concluded that it was constitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners contended that &sect; 24, which permitted businesses and multiple unit dwellings to be built in an area previously zoned for single family residences only, was ineffective because it did not receive the approval of four-fifths of the city council as required by the general zoning ordinance. Appellees, a city, its clerk, its manager, and a landowner, contended that the four-fifths requirement was invalid because it was in conflict with the Morgantown, W. Va., Charter art. II, &sect; 5(1), which stated that majority of all members elected was required for the adoption of any ordinance or resolution. The court held that a city's charter was a law superior to its ordinances and, where the two conflicted, the charter was required to prevail. The court found that the charter under which the city was operating at the time the contested amendment was approved clearly provided that a majority vote of the city council was all that was necessary for either enactment or amendment of ordinances; therefore, the council was not free to enact by ordinance a higher voting requirement.</SPAN></P>

The lower court determined that the riparian owner and the sports fishermen had no standing as third-parties to the contract and that venue was improper because the stream was located outside its jurisdiction. The court reversed the lower court's judgment. The riparian owner and the sports fishermen had standing because the contract was between two government entities for the diversion of environmental resources.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The application forms signed by the applicants met the statutory requirement of oath or affirmation. Because W.Va.

The durational residency requirement failed. It gave none of the usual benefits of continuing residency. Under either the compelling state interest or rational basis test, the requirement failed. The one-year residence requirement was void. There was no reason to strike the entire statute because of the invalidity of one requirement. The remainder of the statute was severable and survived. The court found it impossible to make ineligibility for employment depend on reading into the statute that an applicant must not have attained his or her 35th birthday to be eligible.

The trial court granted the state officials' motion to dismiss. The motion for summary judgment of the parents and students was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents and students alleged that the state system for financing public schools denied them a &quot;thorough and efficient&quot; education, as required by W. Va. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1, and denied them equal protection of the law. Specifically, inequalities allegedly existed in education, created by out-of-balance annual funding, facilities, curriculum, and personnel in property-poor counties compared with more wealthy counties. The parents and students alleged constitutional relief should have been granted because the trial court found that the schools were inadequate. The court held that the motion to dismiss was procedurally improper but chose not to make a judgment and, instead, remanded. The court noted that because education was a fundamental state constitutional right, under the state's equal protection guarantees, any discriminatory classification found in the educational financing system could not stand unless the state demonstrated some compelling state interest to justify the unequal classification. The court concluded that both equal protection and thorough and efficient constitutional principles could be applied harmoniously to the state school financing system.</SPAN></P>

Code, 49-1-4 (1977). After it received a social report and a psychological evaluation, the juvenile court committed the juvenile status offender to the West Virginia Industrial Home for Girls at Salem, an institution in which were housed juveniles who had been adjudicated delinquent for committing criminal offenses. The juvenile status offender sought a writ of prohibition against the juvenile court. The court held that the juvenile court had exceeded its lawful jurisdiction because the institution in question was a secure prison-like facility. The principal security measures at the institution consisted of a locked front door and 16 correctional officers for approximately 22 residents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a juvenile, sought review of an order from a juvenile court (West Virginia), which granted the prosecution's motion to transfer his case from the juvenile jurisdiction to the criminal jurisdiction of the circuit court, thereby permitting him to be treated as an adult instead of as a juvenile on charges that he had shot and killed his father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile was an adolescent, with no previous juvenile or criminal record, who allegedly had fatally shot his father and then telephoned the police to inform them of what he had done. At issue was whether the State had met its burden of proving, by clear and convincing proof, that there were no reasonable prospects for rehabilitating the juvenile through resources available to the juvenile court, as required by W. Va. Code &sect; 49-5-10(a) (1977). Upon its review of the witness testimony, the court noted that the issue before the trial court should not have been whether the juvenile was rehabilitated or whether there was a possibility that he might commit another act of violence. Instead, the inquiry should have been whether there were reasonable prospects for rehabilitating the juvenile through available resources. The court further noted the legislative intention that transfer from juvenile court jurisdiction was to be the exception and not the rule. In reversing, the court concluded that the juvenile court had been correct in determining that the 1977 juvenile law was applicable to the juvenile's case even though the offense allegedly committed occurred in 1975.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of first-degree murder pursuant to W.Va. Code &sect; 61-2-1 [1923] in the criminal jurisdiction of the trial court (West Virginia). Defendants, who were both 15 at the time of the crime, argued that the trial court had erred in refusing to transfer the cases (consolidated on appeal) to the trial court's juvenile jurisdiction. They also appealed the jury instructions and the admission of their confessions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants confessed in writing that they shot and killed the decedent after obtaining a ride with him. They argued on appeal that they had not voluntarily waived their rights to counsel and to remain silent. Defendants also questioned the jury instructions and the trial court's jurisdiction. The court held that transfer was properly refused because neither defendant had a constitutional or statutory right to juvenile jurisdiction, which, under Code &sect; 49-5-3 [1975], did not attach where the violation of law was a capital offense if committed by an adult. However, retrial was required because the jury instructions placed unconstitutional burdens of proof on the defense; one instruction stated that the burden was upon an accused to show that a homicide was committed without malice. On retrial, automatic juvenile jurisdiction was available because retroactive application of Code &sect; 49-5-1(a) [1978] promoted just administration and did not unduly burden the State. The protections of the new Juvenile Proceedings Act concerning juvenile statements were not retroactive in effect, and defendants' statements had to be assessed under a totality of the circumstances test on retrial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and two others broke into a home and the homeowner seized a pistol and shot defendant in the arm.

The trial court ruled in limine that even if defendant's claim were true, it did not constitute a defense to first degree murder under the felony murder rule. Defendant pleaded guilty but then sought review, claiming that he was coerced into pleading guilty by the ruling in limine. On appeal, the court held that the issue was not the correctness of the court's ruling, but the competency of defense counsel in advising the guilty plea. The court held that a defense attorney who believed a ruling to be error had a duty to so advise his client.

The grandfather petitioned for a writ of prohibition enjoining the judge from proceeding with trial. The court held that the trial court had the power to punish the grandfather for contempt for an alleged violation of the court order, despite the fact that he was not a party to the custody proceedings because it was apparent that because of the grandfather's relationship with his son and his physical custody of the child, he was acting in concert with the son to frustrate the trial court's order. The grandfather had been served with notice and a hearing had been set. The trial court was within its discretion in resorting to apprehension of the grandfather by the use of a capias because he had been evading process and it was likely that he would continue to do so.

Defendant had an absolute right to examine the notes, and the denial of that right warranted the award of a new trial. The circuit court also erred in refusing to admit a photograph of defendant under the pictorial testimony theory, on the ground that the person who took the picture was not present at defendant's trial.

During the course of the stop the officer's companion, a reserve policeman, noticed a rifle in plain view inside the vehicle and smelled the odor of marijuana. Defendant was taken into custody, a warrant was obtained to search the van, and the police discovered about 175 pounds of marijuana, two weapons, a set of scales suitable for weighing marijuana, and various sizes of bags. A jury convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, upon which the trial court entered judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant government employee sought review of an adverse ruling of respondent Civil Service Commission of West Virginia which held it had no jurisdiction to consider the employee's case in view of the fact that the legislature removed the position from civil service coverage. The employee's position in the executive branch was abolished as a result of a legislative reorganization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The government employee's position was placed under civil service by executive order. Subsequently, legislation was enacted retroactively removing the positions from civil service. Following passage of the legislation, the employee received written notice that he would be terminated as an employee of the state. He was informed his termination was a result of a legislative reorganization. The employee protested his dismissal by letter to the Commission, which held that it was without jurisdiction to consider his case since the legislature had removed his position from civil service. The employee argued that the executive order validly placed him under civil service and that legislation removing his position from civil service violated the doctrine of separation of powers found in W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 and operated to destroy the vested right he had to his position. The court held that public employment did not confer on the employee a contractual right to a position such that the legislature could not abolish the position or remove it from civil service coverage. The court concluded that the legislature had the right to remove positions from the civil service system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the ruling of the Commission.</SPAN></P>

The attorneys accused the West Virginia legislature of violating &sect; 51B(5) by decreasing five items in the Judiciary's budget for fiscal year 1978-79, and sough a writ of mandamus to require the Clerk to record and publish a constitutionally correct and true budget bill, including therein the five items of the Judiciary's budget without the appropriation decreases attempted to be effected by action of the West Virginia legislature. Awarding the writ, the court held in part that the West Virginia legislature, in its enactment of the budget bill, unconstitutionally decreased line items 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in the Judiciary's budget contained therein, as the legislature had considered the judicial budget before it for consideration and action, and the Judiciary's inherent power to determine what funds were necessary for its operations was substantiated by the express provisions of the West Virginia Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee sought to recover for personal injuries. The employee asserted that a fellow deputy neglected and refused to cover and protect the employee with a shotgun while he was attempting to arrest a person. Summary judgment was entered in favor of the members. On appeal, the court stated that for the first time on appeal the employee raised the issue of governmental immunity. As that issue was not raised in the trial court the court would not decide that issue. The employee asserted that W. Va. Code, 23-2-1, as amended was unconstitutional as being violative of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article III, &sect; 17, and Article VI, &sect; 39 of the West Virginia Constitution. That statute provided that county courts did not have to subscribe to the workmen's compensation fund. It could not be denied that all persons within the class, all persons within the county court, were treated equally. The pleading of the fellow servant rule together with a stipulation by the employee that the members had committed no acts of negligence created a complete defense demonstrating that the action was not maintainable against the members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon invalidation of defendant's conviction for a crime for which he was sentenced to life in prison, defendant was resentenced to one to fifteen years on the principal charge and an additional five years under the habitual criminal statute. Defendant was denied credit for time spent in jail prior to and after the trial on a burglary charge. Defendant alleged that he was entitled to time served and that W. Va. Code &sect; 61-11-18, as it applied to the additional five-year sentence, was unconstitutional. The court agreed that credit for time served was mandatory and reversed. The court held that under the double jeopardy and equal protection clauses of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 10, 17, time spent in jail, either pre-trial or post-trial, had to be credited on the sentence. It was error to impose two separate sentences to run consecutively under the habitual criminal statute. A single sentence of one to twenty years was proper. The court rejected defendant's claims that the sentence violated the cruel and inhuman punishment prohibition and that the habitual criminal statute violated his equal protection rights. The trial court was justified in not hearing evidence on these issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff child and her father appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court, in Clay County (West Virginia), which dismissed their negligence action against defendants, County Board of Education and County Court. The circuit court dismissed the complaint, with prejudice, on the basis of the doctrine of governmental immunity asserted by the Board and county court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was injured in an accident in which the child fell from a footbridge while traveling to school. The complaint alleged that the child's injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendants, the county court and the Board, in failing to keep the bridge in repair and allowing its use by school children without sufficient warning or protective devices. The court affirmed the judgment as to the Board only. W.Va. Code &sect; 17-10-17 (1969) clearly limited the county court's right to raise the shield of governmental immunity, and applied in the case to make the county court susceptible to suit. However, the Board retained immunity as a state entity because not only were county boards of education dependent to a large degree on state fiscal support, but they were also subject to extensive state control exerted by the state. Thus, the Board was entitled to assert the sovereign immunity of the state pursuant to W.Va. Const., art. 6, &sect; 35, in bar of the action filed against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court below with respect to the Board. The ruling of the trial court with respect to the governmental immunity of the county court, however, was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal the customer asserted that there was a common law right in the consumer to just and reasonable rates from a government created monopoly. The court agreed with the customer finding that there was a common law right to reasonable rates from any monopoly created by W. Va. and that right, having existed before the adoption of the W. Va. Constitution, was encompassed within the concept of property protected by W. Va. Const. art. 3, &sect; 10. However, the court found that W. Va. Code &sect; 24-2-4 (1974) provided a method of regulating public utility rates. The court found that it could not say that the method &sect; 24-2-4 did not bear a reasonable relationship to a proper legislative purpose and therefore was constitutional under the substantive due process concepts inherent in W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. Further, the court found that in light of the competing public policies and the need to balance conflicting legitimate interests, the procedures chosen by the legislature comported with the notion of fundamental fairness and passed scrutiny under the due process clause of W.

Before the trial court's order could be implemented the superintendent cancelled his request because defendant was being transferred to a second center due to his behavior. The second center found defendant unfit and the trial court sentenced defendant to 90 days in jail. Defendant was not credited with the days spent at the centers. The court stated that the appeal involved the question of whether defendant, sentenced as a youthful offender under &sect; 25-4-6, was constitutionally entitled to credit for the time spent at the correctional centers. The court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause, West Virginia Constitution, Article III, &sect; 5, required the State to give credit on a criminal sentence for all time spent in detention pursuant to a criminal conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both the ex-wife and the ex-husband filed for divorce. The trial court granted the ex-husband a divorce, awarded him custody of the minor child, and made a specific finding that the ex-wife was not a fit person to have custody of the minor child, because of a single incident of sexual misconduct. The ex-wife appealed the custody award. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court and awarded custody to the ex-wife. The ex-husband argued that the presumption that a mother is the natural custodian of children was unconstitutional. The court found that the presumption of maternal preference was constitutional whether measured under an important governmental interest or a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose standard. The court found that while there was authority for the ex-husband's position, it rejected any rule that made the award of custody dependant upon relative degrees of parental competence rather than the issue of whether the mother was unfit. The court found that the standard for overcoming the maternal presumption was whether the conduct complained of was so outrageous that reasonable men cannot differ about its deleterious affect upon the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to the suit, the officials contended that .Va. Code, 28-5-28 (1977) (West Virginia) was merely directory. The court held that the statute's use of the term &quot;shall&quot; in various statements indicated that the statute was mandatory. The court then held that the statute's method of calculating good time was completely inconsistent with the prior statute regarding good time credits, 28-5-27. Thus, the court held that the legislature intended to repeal 28-5-27. The court also held that 28-5-28 did not constitute an illegal delegation of legislative authority to an administrative body. The court noted that the statute set forth sufficient standards in establishing classifications for good time credit. The court held that the statute was not retroactive and therefore did not apply to the whole term of the inmates' sentences. Additionally, applying a rational basis test, the court held that the denial of retroactive application did not deny the inmates' their equal protection rights. The court held that the inmates were entitled to have good time computed under the statute but were not entitled to discharge because there had been no extreme dereliction of duty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juveniles were inmates of the institution and complained of the institution's practices of placing recalcitrant inmates in security cells, forcing inmates to sit on a bench in one position for hours at a time, forcing inmates to stand straight for hours of time, and using Mace to quell unruly inmates with Mace. The commissioner stated that these practices had stopped and that physical assaults by staff or inmates had been forbidden. The court approved the changes, holding that the enumerated practices constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment and that all inmates subjected to the practices, except in riotous circumstances, were entitled to redress. There was insufficient evidence of lack of rehabilitative programs at the institution to require a finding of unconstitutionality, but the court recommended that incarceration should be limited to those who would clearly benefit from institutionalization or to those who were dangerous to themselves or others. After-the-fact dismissal of psychologically unsuited staff persons who brutalized inmates was an inadequate way to cull unfit staff members.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the taxpayer's activities in the state could not have been characterized as meager. The court held that the taxpayer was engaging or continuing a business &quot;within the state&quot; within the contemplation of W. Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner assessed a privilege tax upon the taxpayer. In another case, the taxpayer appealed the tax to the trial court and then filed the instant declaratory judgment action. The trial court held that the Commissioner had no authority to levy the tax. On review, the court reversed. The court held that as long as the issues in declaratory judgment actions were narrowly limited to legal questions ripe for summary judicial determination, it was an appropriate procedure to challenge the validity of tax assessments. However, the doctrine of substantial reenactment, as applied in the current matter, defeated the taxpayer's attack on the tax assessment. A formal comparison of the old and new statutes clearly demonstrated that the new statutes substantially reenacted the old. The new statutes made minor changes. Nonetheless, both the old and new statutes taxed certain carriers on gross income generated by business activity conducted entirely within the state and on apportioned net income generated by interstate business activity. The Commissioner, therefore, was not deprived of the power to make the tax assessment under the repealed statutes,&nbsp;W. Va. Code &sect; 11-12A-4 and 5 (1959).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with four felony offenses involving forgery. She pled guilty to one charge and told the judge that she had been convicted of a felony within the past five years. The judge accepted her plea and continued the matter. At sentencing, the judge told the defendant that he was going to go against the statutory law and put her on probation for four years. The prosecutor told the judge that he had not anticipated the judge's noncompliance with the law and that the other charges would not have been dismissed if he knew that probation would be granted. The court held that as the language of &sect; 62-12-2 was clear and unambiguous, the statute had to be applied, not construed. The judge was bound by &sect; 62-12-2, and by placing the defendant on probation when she had been convicted of a felony within the previous five years, the judge exceeded his legitimate powers. The court further found that &sect; 62-12-2 was constitutionally sound because probation was a matter of grace, and legislation precluding one from consideration therefor by reason of former felony convictions was not cruel and unusual punishment or the imposition of a penalty disproportionate to the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The West Virginia Human Rights Commission found the agency guilty of racial discrimination after the agency denied a black woman the opportunity to view a house. The commission issued a remedial order which required, among other things, that the agency pay to the complainant the sum of $ 1,000, as compensation for her personal injuries in the matter. The agency appealed that order to the trial court, which reversed the decision of the commission. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the commission could award damages in connection with a complaint, even without any monetary loss to the complainant, if the damages were minimal in amount and were only incidental to the larger objective of the commission in issuing the remedial order. The court otherwise affirmed its prior rulings that administrative agencies did not have the authority to grant large damage awards. To permit large damage awards which were the primary relief granted would be to deprive the offending party of his right to trial by jury. In this case, the court determined that the damage award was minor in amount, and was only incidental to an order of the commission.</SPAN></P>

The court could not condone the actions of the court-appointed counsel in failing to perfect the appeal. The court recognized, however, that defendant, who was knowledgeable of his rights, took no positive action to notify any court that his counsel was not pursuing his appeal until he filed the writ of habeas corpus some four years after counsel was appointed to take the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a patient and an administrator, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Wood County (West Virginia), which dismissed plaintiffs' complaints as to defendants, a hospital, its trustees, and a city, because the notice of claim provided in W. Va. Code &sect; 8-12-20 (1931) was not filed as required in said code provision. The hospital was a municipal facility under the general supervision and control of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs each filed separate negligence actions against the hospital. Alleging that plaintiffs failed to give the city timely notice of their claims as required by W. Va.

The trial court granted the motions in each case and dismissed the actions with prejudice. The sole issue, dispositive of the cases, was whether the notice of claim provision of W. Va. Code &sect; 8-12-20 (1931) was violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court was of the opinion that the requirements of the statute did constitute such violations of both federal and state constitutions. The court held that: (1) the notice of claim statute created an obvious potential for plaintiffs to be precluded harshly and unfairly from prosecuting their claims; and (2) where there was a variance in the treatment afforded governmental tort-feasors and private tort-feasors, both members of a natural class, &sect; 8-12-20 constituted an invidious discrimination which was impermissible under the constitutional guarantees of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner filed a petition contending that the parole board's refusal to credit the time served on parole against his original sentence violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the state constitution. The court granted the writ of habeas corpus, holding that the prisoner was entitled to have credited to his underlying sentence the time he served on parole because it was under his sentence that the parolee was returned to confinement after revocation of his parole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner contended that W. Va. Code, 61-2-15, which was the statute in effect at the time that the alleged rape occurred, unconstitutionally treated males differently than females and, thereby, denied males equal protection of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The statute had since been repealed and replaced. The statute imposed life imprisonment without eligibility for parole upon a male over 16 years who carnally knew a previously chaste female, not his wife, who was under 16 or any female not his wife who was less than 10 years old. A female over 16 who carnally knew a male not her husband who was less than 16 was guilty of a misdemeanor. The court disagreed with petitioner's argument that the court was compelled to consider any statute that classified individuals by gender as &quot;inherently suspect.&quot; The court opined that the gender-based classification under W. Va. Code, 61-2-15, served important governmental objectives and was substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court committed reversible error when it permitted the state to attempt to impeach defendant's credibility by questioning him as to a prior felony. The court reestablished the rule that prohibited the use of evidence of prior criminal convictions to impeach defendant's credibility. Under that rule, however, there was the recognized exception that if defendant elected to place his good character in issue, evidence of prior convictions could then have been introduced along with other relevant evidence bearing on bad character. Another exception to the general prohibition against impeachment of defendant by evidence of his prior convictions was a prior conviction of perjury or false swearing. The court reasoned that conviction of those crimes went directly to the credibility of defendant, and their relevancy had a priority over their possible prejudicial effect. Accordingly, defendant's conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 61-3-20 declared unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 61-3-20 was an embezzlement law. A query presented was whether or not the statute created an impermissible presumption of guilt and thereby violated Article III, &sect;&sect; 5, 10 of the West Virginia Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Respondent was a state judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">W.Va. Code, &sect; 61-3-20 provided that in the prosecution of a public officer charged with embezzlement where the subject property was not restored or accounted for within thirty days after proper demand had been made for it the officer was presumed to be guilty of such offense. There was a second presumption of the same statute: a presumption of prima facie evidence of appropriation by failure to account or pay over. The court stated that the thirty-day presumption permitted defendant to rebut it, but it illegally shifted the burden of proving innocence to defendant. The State was not allowed to create any statutory presumptions of guilt that vitiated the constitutionally granted presumption of innocence or right to remain silent. The prima-facie presumption was also unconstitutional. For a conviction, the State had to prove without any presumptions against defendant every element of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the entire statute was not unconstitutional and let stand the remainder after striking the presumptions. The court held that there was nothing facially unconstitutional about W.Va. Code, &sect; 62-2-5.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ, finding that the definition of &quot;employee&quot; in the West Virginia wage and hour law did not exclude conservation officers. The court found that the conservation officers did not work in a professional, administrative, or executive capacity and that no other exceptions applied to the position. The court overruled its decision in State ex rel. Giles v. Bonar, 155 W.Va. 421 (1971), in which it found that &quot;officers&quot; were not covered by the wage and hour law, ruling that nothing in the wage and hour law excluded &quot;officers&quot; as such, unless they were employed within one of the excluded categories. The court concluded that the conservation officers had a clear right to the relief sought under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 21-5C-2 and 21-5C-3.

As a result, defendant was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. On appeal, the court reversed and directed that an acquittal be entered. According to the court, the charge that defendant procured the marriage by use of an altered minor female's birth certificate was insufficient as a matter of law because no evidence was ever introduced to connect defendant to having caused the minor to alter her birth certificate. The other possible ground for supporting the contributing charge, causing the minor to repeatedly desert her parents' home without just cause and without the parents' consent, also failed as a matter of law. The marriage, though perhaps voidable, was valid, and a valid marriage contemplated the wife leaving her parents' home to live with her husband. The court noted that there was no penalty in West Virginia for an underage marriage and only a nominal penalty in Maryland where the marriage occurred.</SPAN></P>

W.Va. Code, &sect; 8-5-7(c) imposed a property qualification that she did not meet for the subject election. At issue was the constitutionality of &sect; 8-5-7(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">W.Va. Code, &sect; 8-5-7(c) required that the proposed candidate for the year preceding the election have been assessed with and paid real or personal property taxes to the City on at least $ 100 worth of property. It was held previously that Article IV, &sect; 4 of the West Virginia Constitution did not prevent qualifications not enumerated by it being imposed by the Legislature. However, such qualifications could not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution and its state equivalent, Article III, &sect; 17 of the West Virginia Constitution. The right to become a candidate for election to public office was a fundamental one such that the test applied required the State to show a compelling interest in support of the qualification as a classification. The court ruled that there was no compelling interest that justified the statute. Thus, the statute was unconstitutional under Article III, &sect; 17. The rationale of the court was in part that ownership of property had no relationship to honesty, integrity, and intelligence, which were aspects expected of public officials.</SPAN></P>

The trial court in reversing the board's decision held that paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of General Order No. 14 violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution by reason of being vague and overbroad and thus productive of a chilling effect upon the litigant's right to free speech. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) where the litigant was a member of a group at which the regulations were directed, he had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the subject regulations for vagueness and overbreadth; and (2) the overbreadth of the regulations created an imbalance between the rights of the litigant and the needs of the department in operating efficiently, in that the litigant's freedom of speech was unconstitutionally restricted.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court referred the matter to a commissioner for the taking of evidence. After the contractor rested before the commissioner the company renewed its efforts for a jury trial. The company claimed it was entitled to a jury trial on its counterclaim because the contract called for the work to be done in three phases and two of the phases were not completed and that the contractor had been paid the guaranteed cost under the contract. The court granted the writ of prohibition, finding that bringing the writ two years after the denial of its motion did not result in a waiver for failure to timely institute its action in prohibition because the company did all it could to protect itself and was not dilatory. The court found that the issues raised by the company in its counterclaim, principally, whether the contractor breached the contract, were triable by a jury under W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 13.

The court denied the writ, finding that the constitutionality of the felony murder rule had been previously considered and found to be constitutional and that it did not deny a defendant due process. There was no shift of burden of proof to the defendant in a felony murder statute because the crime of first degree murder was proved by the prosecution by proof of the defendant's commission of, or attempt to commit one of the enumerated felonies, plus proof of the accompanying murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner patients challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Roane County (West Virginia), which denied them hearings on their petitions for writs of habeas corpus. Respondent, the Attorney General of West Virginia, filed answers, asking that the judgment be reversed as to the errors admitted but affirmed as to the remaining assignment of errors denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patients were involuntarily committed for an indeterminate period to a state mental health facility. They filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus, alleging that their commitment and confinement were illegal and unconstitutional. The circuit court denied them hearings on their petitions. The Attorney General admitted that the circuit court erred in denying one of the patients an opportunity to present evidence in support of his allegation that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. He also admitted that the circuit court erred in denying to the other patient an opportunity to present evidence in support of his allegation that the notice of hearing sent to him failed to specify his right to have counsel appointed to him and his right to consult with counsel. The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court based on those errors. However, it refused to affirm the judgment on the other alleged errors of the circuit court, holding that they presented substantial factual issues that were not heard. The court ruled that the administrative and appeal procedures in involuntary hospitalization cases did not limit the patients' right to seek release by habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect; 49-1-4 (1941), which defines a &quot;delinquent child,&quot; and W. Va. Code &sect; 49-5-11 (1975), which authorizes certain methods of disposition for children adjudged delinquent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile was nearly 16 at the time he was adjudged delinquent for truancy, and he was ordered incarcerated for almost a year past the legal age when school attendance was required. The juvenile lived in a remote, rural area and had some difficulty getting to school during the winter months. The juvenile was also ridiculed and shunned by his classmates because he suffered from a facial disfigurement and was mildly retarded. The juvenile argued that the entire juvenile commitment procedure violated the due process clauses and the cruel and unusual punishment clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court granted the writ. In doing so, the court held that W. Va. Code &sect; 49-1-4 (1941) and W. Va. Code &sect; 49-5-11 (1975), in the absence of guidelines for their application, failed to meet the equal protection, substantive due process, and the cruel and unusual punishment standards because they permitted the classification and treatment of status offenders in the same manner as criminal offenders. However, the court saved the statutes from constitutional infirmity under the doctrine of the least obtrusive remedy by setting forth guidelines for their application.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, the president had a clear ministerial duty to execute the agreement as directed.

The sheriff contended that &sect; 7-10-4 permitted him to detain the cattle until the expenses in caring and providing for them had been paid. The trial court granted the animal owner's motion to dismiss, on the ground that &sect; 7-10-4 was unconstitutional. The question was certified to the court, which upheld the trial court decision that &sect; 7-10-4 was unconstitutional because it denied the animal owners due process right to an expeditious hearing. Under &sect; 7-10-4 a person's livestock or other animals could be taken without prior notice and the owner then became liable for the expenses of caring for the seized animals. The court commented further that Va.

The injunction was to restrain the Commission from operating a restaurant in the State Capitol under a contract with a corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission constructed a restaurant facility in the Capitol. It received four proposals to operate a restaurant, including one from the Society. The Commission awarded the contract to the corporation. The circuit court judge found that W. Va. Code, 18-10G (1971) foreclosed food service in the Capitol by any entity other than the Society. Awarding a writ of prohibition, the court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional. The statute purported to provide that the State had to offer the Society the opportunity to provide food service, if food service was proposed in a public building. If the Society chose to operate the food service, then it did so without the payment of rent. Under West Virginia Constitution, Article 10, &sect; 6, the State was not to grant its credit to any entity. The court concluded that providing space in a building to be used without costs was a grant of credit in the same way that setting up a fund to be drawn upon would be. The State could not, in the name of assisting in the rehabilitation of the blind and other disadvantaged citizens, extend facilities rent-free to a private corporation such as the Society.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff brought a civil suit against defendant to recover for equipment and labor furnished to defendant. Plaintiff sought and obtained an order of attachment and writ of garnishment, but upon a motion to quash the attachment, and without ruling on the sufficiency of plaintiff 's original or amended affidavit in support of its claim, the circuit court held the provisions of Article 7 of Chapter 38 of the West Virginia Code to be violative of due process for lack of pre-seizure notice and hearing. On appeal, the court held that the filing of an affidavit that contained specific factual allegations, and the issuance of the order of attachment by the clerk, an officer of the court, upon a determination that the statutory mandates were met, was consistent with due process guarantees, and thus, the provisions at issue were not in contravention of either W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court found that the nature and scope of the hearing afforded by W. Va.

Va. Code &sect; 51-2-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">W.Va. Senate Bill No. 322 added eight judgeships to various judicial circuits, and vacancies in the nominations therefor could be filled only as general law provided at the time Senate Bill No. 322 became effective. The nominee was chosen for a judgeship by a judicial committee, and the Secretary later certified the nominee's candidacy. The citizen sought a writ of mandamus to strike down the nomination procedure, and the court held that Senate Bill No. 322 was effective in creating an opening for an additional judgeship that was to be filled at the next general election, and thus, the procedure used by the Secretary to place the nominee on the ballot as a candidate for such judgeship was proper because it did not invidiously discriminate against independent candidates. The court found that the citizen's objection to the application of W.Va. Code &sect; 51-2-1 (1976) as to the deadlines it required for candidates in general elections was purely speculative and theoretical as no independent candidate had emerged to demand ballot access.

The inmate was later resentenced in order to provide an additional appeal period, during which time, no complete transcript was provided to him in order to perfect his appeal. The inmate thus sought habeas corpus relief, and the court held that the State's failure to provide the inmate, upon a timely request, a transcript of his trial proceedings was a violation of due process and prevented the prompt exercise of the inmate's appellate rights. The court found that relief in habeas corpus for failure to provide a transcript within the maximum one-year period authorized by W. Va. Code &sect; 58-5-4, as amended, operated to discharge an inmate subject to the right of the State to provide a transcript within 30 days, but the authority of the trial court to resentence was limited to those instances in which the transcript was made available within the 30-day period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court awarded the writ of habeas corpus prayed for by the inmate and ordered him discharged, with such discharge delayed for a period of 30 days in order to provide the State with an opportunity to deliver the transcript and for the inmate to seek such further appropriate relief as may have been consistent with the principles announced in the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge had entered an order of appointment pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 62-3-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant provided a pauper's affidavit, the attorney was appointed to represent defendant. The attorney filed a motion with the trial court seeking to be relieved of the appointment on the ground that defendant was not indigent. The judge denied the motion because he was without discretion to inquire beyond the pauper's affidavit. In addition to the writ, the attorney asked the court to exercise its rule-making power and relieve the attorneys of West Virginia from the obligation to represent indigent defendants in criminal proceedings. The court denied the writ and held that the fact of defendant's absence in the proceeding was sufficient, in and of itself, to preclude the granting of prohibition. Further, the facts were inadequate for a determination of defendant's financial capability. The court found that the interests of justice, and the corollary concerns for the practicing attorneys and the indigent persons charged with crimes, required the court to take remedial action. With deference to the legislature, the court concluded that the only appropriate remedy was to order that the lawyers of West Virginia no longer be required to accept appointments as in the past.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor wished to run for a third term, and argued that the Governors Succession Amendment violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 since it denied equal protection of the laws to those persons who wished to reelect him for a third successive term. The court disagreed since it pointed out that this was an incidental limitation on the franchise attendant upon the accomplishment of a valid public purpose of setting parameters for candidates for public office, i.e. prior felony convictions. The governor asserted that W. Va. Const., Art. VII, &sect; 4 was ambiguous and, therefore, the ambiguities should be construed in favor of eligibility and against retroactive application. This court found no ambiguity since the issue concerned a typographical error. The court recognized the governor's argument that the secretary of state was not charged with judicial duties, but held he was charged with certifying only those persons who were so entitled. The court held that whenever a state-wide candidate had filed a certificate of candidacy with the secretary of state, any person with standing to challenge the candidate's eligibility could raise such challenge through an action in mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate contended that his probation was revoked without due process of law and was unreasonable. Specifically, the inmate claimed that he was denied due process of law when probation terms were established in the absence of the inmate or his counsel. The court determined that under W. Va. Code, 62-3-2 (West Virginia), a person indicted for felony was to be present personally during the trial and any proceedings affecting such person. The court held that the statute required the presence of the inmate when his sentence was announced. In addition, the court determined that the right extended to and included the right to be present when the terms of a sentence, or modification or change of sentence was pronounced. Because every condition of probation constituted a restriction of liberty, due process required that the inmate be present when such conditions were discussed. In addition, inasmuch as no written notice of charges were issued to the inmate and he was not afforded a preliminary hearing before an independent hearing officer when his probation was revoked, the court found that the hearing was defective constitutionally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

However, the court denied the writs. The court held that &sect; 61-2-15 did not encourage them to plead guilty in order to avoid a potentially more harsh sentence that could result from a jury trial. Instead, &sect; 61-2-15 vested the same discretion in a trial court as it did in the jury. If defendants pled not guilty and the jury found them guilty and went no further, a life sentence would be imposed. If the jury recommended mercy, the sentence of 10 to 20 years would be imposed. On the other hand, if defendants pled guilty, the trial judge could either impose a life sentence or, in his discretion, could show mercy and impose a sentence of 10 to 20 years. Defendants were not under a subtle compulsion to plead guilty to obtain a plea bargain in order to enhance the probability of their obtaining mitigated sentences. Their right to have a fair and impartial jury was not violated by having a single jury determine both the issue of guilt and degree of punishment. The absence of standards to guide the trial judge or the jury when they were imposing sentence did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court certified the question regarding whether a lease agreement and a dealer contract created an integrated business relationship as to plaintiff lessor's detainer lawsuit against defendant lessee. The court determined that the documents create an integrated relationship, reversed the grant of plaintiff's motion for a judgment on the pleadings, and remanded the case. The court reasoned that a fair reading of the documents disclosed that they were so interrelated on their face that either, standing alone, would have been meaningless without the other and that neither party would have entered into either the lease agreement or the dealer contract separately. The court also held that the termination provisions that were at issue were incapable of being reconciled in such a manner as to be clearly expressive of an intention that could have been said to have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties. The court further determined that a unilateral cancellation clause in the dealer agreement was unconscionable on its face, and that the trial court had to refuse to enforce the agreement or to limit the clause so as to avoid an unconscionable result.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained defendant's special plea and dismissed the indictment charging him with a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for the felony of third offense driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The indictment alleged two convictions for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor within five years immediately prior to the occurrence giving rise to the present charge. One of the convictions was imposed by a mayor. Defendant filed a special plea to the indictment in which he asserted that the conviction by the mayor was unconstitutionally void because the mayor improperly exercised judicial and executive power simultaneously. The court dismissed the case because the questions presented to the court were not certifiable. The court ruled that appealable judgments were not reviewable by certificate. The action of the trial court in dismissing the indictment charging a felony was a final judgment as to such charge and could be appealed by the State. The court held that the proper method to challenge the action of a trial court in dismissing an indictment for insufficiency was to appeal such actions under the provisions of Code, 58-5-30.

They were prosecuted under statute that provided where two or more persons were present during and were aiding and abetting the commission of a crime, the act was presumptively committed in furtherance of a conspiracy, in the absence of satisfactory proof to the contrary. Defendants sought writ of prohibition against judge from proceeding with trial on indictment charging them with violation of the statute. The Supreme Court of Appeals granted the writ, declaring the statute unconstitutional because it infringed upon defendant's right against self-incrimination, it destroyed the presumption of innocence to which an defendant was entitled, and it had evidentiary effect which permitted conviction by presumption rather than by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The statute at issue was W. Va. Code 1931, 7-1-5a, as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was alleged that Chapter 21, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session 1971, which authorized the increased compensation to the commissioner, violated West Virginia Constitution, Article VI, &sect; 38. The commissioner requested a writ of mandamus to compel the payment, and the court held in favor of the commissioner. First, the court noted that in 1972, the state legislature enacted Chapter 21, Acts of the Legislature (West Virginia), Regular Session 1972, created a crime, delinquency, and correction commission. As a result, the commissioner's duties, as chairman of the commission, were increased. Consequently, W. Va. Code 1931, 7-1-3q and 3r, the omnibus salary measure, authorized the payment of additional compensation for those increased duties. Although W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 38, prohibited an increase in the salary of a public official during the incumbent's term of office, it did not prohibit increases where newly imposed duties embraced a new field and were beyond the scope or range of the office. Finally, the payment of the commissioner's salary was a ministerial and nondiscretionary duty to comply with the law; thus, a writ of mandamus was proper to compel payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner citizen, on his own behalf and on that of other citizens, filed an application for a writ of mandamus against respondent county commissioners. He sought to have them to cease paying and receiving salary increases and to return additional compensation already collected by them. The citizen argued that Chapter 21, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session 1972, violated West Virginia Constitution, Article VI, &sect; 38.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Referring to its holding in a companion case, the court stated that W. Va. Code 1931, 7-1-5a, 7-7-4 and 7-7-5 provided constitutionally permissible salary increases for incumbent county officials. A portion of W. Va. Code 1931, 7-7-3, however, would result in automatic salary increases to incumbent county officials. Under the constitution, salary increases were permissible only when the additional compensation was based upon the imposition of new and additional duties upon the officials. An automatic escalator clause such as the one here, providing for increase of salaries to county officials during their present term of office without also placing the concomitant burden of new and additional duties upon those offices, was facially unconstitutional. W. Va. Code 1931, 7-7-21, however, contained a severability clause, so the unconstitutional escalator provision would not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the 1972 Act, the rest of which was constitutional. As the escalator provision had not been allowed to stand and any application of it was merely a future prospect, the citizen was not entitled to a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

Herndon v. Blankenship. The issue was whether a former refusal by the court to issue a rule in mandamus deprived a circuit court of authority to consider an identical case prosecuted by and against the same parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A mandamus petition was filed to compel the clerk to report legislative acts, omitting certain enumerated enrolled bills which allegedly violated Article VI, &sect; 29 and &sect; 51 of the Constitution of West Virginia. The action questioned the constitutionality of revenue measures not read on three separate days as required. Mandamus was refused. The clerk petitioned for a writ to prohibit further proceedings, maintaining that Code, 1931, 53-1-2 and 53-1-5, as amended, precluded a circuit court from issuing a rule in mandamus in the face of a former adjudication by the court refusing such a rule on a similar petition. The argument was predicated on the theory that a refusal to issue a rule constituted &quot;cognizance&quot; of the case and an adjudication that no prima facie case was established. The question was whether Code, 53-1-2 and Code, 53-1-5 deprived the circuit courts of jurisdiction or merely defined more explicitly extraordinary remedies within the constitutional framework. The court retained original jurisdiction in cases of extraordinary writs. To the extent that the Doyle and Ballard cases were inconsistent with the holding, they were expressly overruled.</SPAN></P>

The son contended that his incarceration for a period of one year because of his financial inability to post a peace bond under West Virginia Code, 62-10-3 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The indigent's father swore out a peace bond, alleging that his son had threatened him. The indigent was arrested on a peace bond warrant pursuant to West Virginia Code, 62-10-2. He was unable to post the $ 500 peace bond because he was an indigent and was consequently incarcerated in the county jail pending a hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing a magistrate determined that there was good cause to fear that the indigent intended to commit an offense against his father and ordered a peace bond of $ 500 to insure his good behavior. When he could not post bond, the indigent was incarcerated for one-year. On review the court held that the statute was constitutional, but unconstitutionally applied. The statute was analogous to a recognizance bond in a criminal case, and based on a showing of probable cause. Much like an appearance bond, the indigent should have been given his release on his own recognizance when he was unable to post bond. The court also rejected his argument that commitment jail was cruel and unusual punishment because release was conditioned on the posting of bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed. The court directed that the indigent be released on his own recognizance.</SPAN></P>

The State conceded that petitioner's confession was extracted under adverse conditions without the benefit of counsel and was subsequently used at trial without a prior in camera hearing to determine its voluntariness. Despite the fact that counsel made no specific request, the trial court had a mandatory duty to hear the evidence and determine the voluntariness of a confession out of the presence of the jury prior to its introduction into evidence.

The governor signed the Budget Bill after making reductions and deletions and returned it to the legislature, which did not come up with the two-thirds vote required to override the veto actions. Relators instituted the action to compel the clerk to publish the Budget Act as unaffected by the veto actions. On review, the court granted a writ of mandamus and ordered the Budget Act published as modified by the governor. The court held that the governor had the constitutional authority under the Modern Budget Amendment, W.Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 51D(11), to veto any part of the accounts of the legislature and language of purpose, finding, and condition. The court stated the governor also had the constitutional power under the Modern Budget Amendment to reinsert lump sums and language regarding purpose, itemization, and amounts relating to the bill. The court further ruled that &sect; 51D(11) gave the governor the power to adjust the language of a bill and that law as modified was valid in the absent of legislative veto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted an urban renewal plan, which required the relocation of power lines. A declaratory judgment suit was commenced to determine whether the power company or the city was to bear the relocation costs. The circuit court rendered judgment ruling that the power company was liable for the relocation costs. The power company appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that, although W. Va. Code, 16-18-27 (1957), permitted an urban renewal authority to make relocation payments to those displaced by an urban renewal project, the statute was permissive and was not an adequate foundation for a right to receive compensation. It merely authorized the disbursement of funds; it did not require such a disbursement. Further, where the franchise contract between the city and the power company did not address this issue, the common law governed, and thereunder, the power company had no right to reimbursement. Under the common law, public utilities could be required at their own expense to move their facilities from public streets in order to facilitate reconstruction or improvement of the public ways upon which the public utility facilities were previously located.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ of mandamus requiring the chairman to perform his nondiscretionary duties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted pursuant to the Dangerous Drugs Act, W. Va. Code ch. 16, art. 8B, &sect; 1, et seq., as amended. Section 1(d) of the Act provided that a &quot;dangerous drug&quot; was any drug, which under regulations promulgated by the State Board of Pharmacy in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of June 25, 1938, or any amendment thereto, was designated as dangerous or habit-forming. On the date defendant was indicted, the legislature had not explicitly prohibited the possession, sale, or delivery of LSD. After the Dangerous Drugs Act was enacted, the Board, acting under the authority of &sect; 1(d), declared that LSD was dangerous and habit-forming. On appeal, the court held that although statutes adopting laws or regulations of agencies of the Federal Government or State agencies, effective at the time of adoption, were valid, attempted adoption of future laws, rules, or regulations, of such agencies was unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power. As such, &sect; 1(d), insofar as it purported to delegate to the Board the power to declare unlawful drugs designated by the Federal Government to be dangerous in the future, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that (1) &sect; 49-7-7 was a general criminal statute that did not touch upon the First Amendment or other sensitive constitutional areas, and it was tested for vagueness by examining the face of the statute and by considering the statute in light of the conduct in which it was applied; (2) read in pari materia with &sect; 49-1-4, a statute defining delinquency, &sect; 49-7-7 was not so vague that men of common intelligence were necessarily required to guess at its meaning and differ as to its application; &sect; 49-7-7 was sufficiently specific and gave adequate notice of the crime charged; and (3) while two definitions of delinquency in &sect; 49-1-4 were invalid, the remaining part of the statute was capable of being executed independently and was enforceable.</SPAN></P>

The predecessor thereafter granted the corporation a right to drill a test well on the lands that were the within the state park. The corporation being unsuccessful in its efforts to obtain a drilling permit from the State brought an action against respondents for a writ of mandamus. The court denied the corporation's application for the writ, holding that inasmuch as the predecessor had a binding agreement with the State Department of Natural Resources not to drill gas wells within the state park, it was not necessary for the Department to obtain the predecessor's leases either by purchase or condemnation.

The court found that the record was devoid of any evidence that the pickets were in violation of any state law or regulation. The court held that the injunction should have barred specific illegal acts, not legitimate communication of ideas. The picketing was not to accomplish an illegal purpose, nor was there any allegation of any illegal purpose. The blanket temporary injunction against such picketing violated the union's First Amendment rights of free speech. It was equally clear that the circuit court was without jurisdiction to grant the injunction against picketing. Congress declared in the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 153 et seq., that industrial disputes involving interstate commerce were under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife was injured when she got out of her car and the sod in the grassy strip between the curb and sidewalk upon which she stepped suddenly gave way. The court first addressed the husband's claim. Under City of Charleston, W. Va. Charter &sect; 95, the husband could not maintain an action for personal injury unless he had filed a written verified statement of the nature of his claim with the city clerk within 30 days after the cause of action accrued. The court found that the notice from the wife was sufficient notice to cover both her claim and that of her husband as the city ample opportunity to investigate the claim. The city argued that plaintiffs failed to allege and prove that the city charter required the city to keep its streets and sidewalks in repair. The court held that the trial court could take judicial notice of the city's laws. It also held that W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 35, which provided sovereign immunity to the state did not apply to chartered municipalities. Any immunity the city might have had at common law was abolished by W. Va. Code &sect; 17-10-17 (1931), which created liability on the city for injuries caused by sidewalks being out of repair.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision finding the city liable for the injuries to the wife. The court reversed the decision striking the verdict in favor of the husband and reinstated the trial court judgment in his favor.</SPAN></P>

He was committed under W.Va. Code &sect; 62-3-9 (1931), which allowed for commitment of a mentally defective person charged with a crime. The criminal defendant, as well as others similarly situated, filed suit claiming that he was denied due process, equal protection of the laws, and substantive due process. The court granted the request for a writ of habeas corpus. The court first dismissed the others from the lawsuit, without prejudice, because class actions were not applicable in habeas corpus proceedings. By subjecting the criminal defendant to a more lenient standard of commitment and to a more stringent standard of release than those applicable to mental incompetents not charged with offenses, he was condemned to permanent institutionalization without the proof necessary for civil commitment or the opportunity for release. The court held that the State could commit a person for a reasonable time to determine competency and to restore competency, but that &sect; 62-3-9 was otherwise unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Va. Acts 127 was invalid under W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 33, as amended in 1970.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chairman challenged the constitutional validity of the legislative pension program between 1961 and 1971, as well as certain provisions in the pension program that were enacted in 1971, on the grounds that they were invalid under W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 33, as amended in 1971. The chairman claimed that, by providing pensions based on service from 1961 to 1971, the program failed to follow the recommendations of the commission, which under &sect; 33, as amended in 1970, completely prohibited the legislature from enacting a pension plan because it would constitute an &quot;allowance&quot; or &quot;emolument&quot; as proscribed by &sect; 33. The trustees contended that the language &quot;no other allowance or emolument&quot; related only to salary, expenses, and other immediate allowances and did not prohibit pensions; that the word &quot;pension&quot; was not used in &sect; 33, as amended in 1971, like its predecessor of 1970; and that it related only to salaries and expenses. The court held that the pension program was valid as to provisions that accorded legislators greater benefits for service after 1971 and that those provisions were severable from other provisions that failed to conform to the resolution of the commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the chairman's writ in part and denied it in part as to the validity of a state law that authorized an increase in pension benefits for legislators who served prior to 1971.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed a jury verdict requiring each of the two defendants to pay plaintiff four times the amount of interest that the contract provided plaintiff would pay, and it affirmed the trial court's voiding of all interest requirements under the contract. In tripartite financing common in the installment sales industry, the distinction between a loan and forbearance no longer was significant.

Four years later, the patient filed a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he was deprived of due process when he was committed to the mental hospital under W. Va. Code &sect; 27-5-4. The court held that at the time the patient was committed, the patient failed to be told of the facts underlying and supporting the application for involuntary commitment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The West Virginia Department of Highways brought condemnation proceedings to condemn four pieces of property owned by the landowners in order to build a highway. In conformity with West Virginia Code, 1931, 54-2-14a, the Department of Highways deposited allayment funds with the judge, which were paid to the landowners. These allayment funds represented the Department of Highways' estimate of the fair market value of the land. The Department of Highways moved pursuant to West Virginia Code, 1931, 54-2-14 to continue the condemnation proceedings until a reasonable time had elapsed for the completion of the construction. The judge denied the motion for a continuance. Granting writs of prohibition to the Department of Highways, the court held that West Virginia Code, 1931, 54-2-14a, which did not contain continuance provisions, had to be read in pari materia with West Virginia Code, 1931, 54-2-14, which contained mandatory continuance provisions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Chapter 7, Article 3, &sect; 2, Code, 1931 (West Virginia), as amended by Chapter 25, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1971 (West Virginia), required all but two of the state's county courthouses to be open on Saturdays. The population of the county determined whether the county was subject to the law. The Clerk was directed by the county court to keep the courthouse open on Saturday, but he refused and the taxpayers group sought a writ of mandamus compelling him to do so. The court denied the writ. The court ruled that the amendment to the act was unconstitutional because it was special legislation that was prohibited by Article VI, &sect; 39 of the Constitution of West Virginia. The court ruled that the classification was arbitrary and bore no natural or reasonable relationship to the purpose of the law. The act of the county court ordering the county offices to remain open on Saturday was without authority.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the issue of neglect and parental unfitness was not established by clear, cogent, and convincing proof.

The court found that, contrary to the relator's assertions, the zoning map, which was made part of the zoning ordinance in 1957, in its legend, showed that the area where the relator's property was located was zoned &quot;A Residential&quot;. Relator contended that the trailer ordinance was invalid because it did not provide for rules or regulations or other criteria for respondents to use in making decisions to grant or withhold house trailer permits. However, the trailer ordinance did have certain regulations with regard to the location and the facilities of house trailers, and the relator failed to show that the regulations were unreasonable. The evidence did not show that the area for which relator requested a permit to use as a house trailer court was primarily a commercial area. On the contrary, there were no other businesses located in that area zoned as &quot;A Residential&quot; except two other trailer parks, which were in the area under entirely different circumstances from those of the relator.</SPAN></P>

(1931) provided an acceptable vehicle for the application of church ecclesiastical law to property disputes involving churches of either connectional and hierarchical polities or congregational and autonomous polities; (2) while legal title to church property might have been in the trustees, its use and beneficial ownership was controlled by the customs, discipline, and ecclesiastical law of the church; (3) the Book of Discipline, U.M.C. (1968), para. 1501 prescribed that titles to property held by trustees of a local church were held in trust for the general church; and (4) this rule constituted a judgment of a church tribunal, which was absolutely conclusive upon the court as to matters contained therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a public utility that manufactured electricity and sold power to the public.

The commissioner maintained that the taxpayer was a manufacturer of electric power generated at a certain plant not distributed in utility sales within the State of West Virginia and that quarry operations it conducted at the plant to construct a dam there made it a producer of natural resource products. The taxpayer contended that because it was taxed as a public utility, it could not be taxed under W. Va. Code &sect; 11-13-2b as a manufacturer of electric power. The court held that the removal of rock and stone at the site was an isolated event and did not render the taxpayer subject to taxation as a producer of natural resources.

Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of robbing a 70-year-old man. While awaiting trial, defendant wrote an incriminating letter that attempted to tailor the testimony of an alleged accomplice. Contrary to a pre-trial order granted under the Code, 1931, 62-1B-2 (West Virginia), as amended, for disclosure of any of defendant's written statements, the prosecution did not furnish the defense with the letter prior to its use in the cross-examination of defendant. The jury then found defendant guilty of armed robbery. On appeal, defendant contended that the circuit court erred in denying a self-defense instruction and in allowing the prosecution to use the letter to cross-examine defendant. First, the court held that the circuit court properly denied the instruction because the armed robbery was not justifiable on the theory of self-defense. Second, the court held that defendant was entitled to a new trial because he was unfairly surprised or misled to his disadvantage by the prosecution's use of the letter. The court reasoned that the prosecution had ample time to make the obviously prejudicial letter available to the defense in accordance with the pre-trial order.</SPAN></P>

VI, &sect; 51(11), which authorized the Governor to disapprove or reduce items or parts of items contained in the Budget Bill enacted by the Legislature did not permit the Governor to reduce appropriations to the judiciary; (2) the Governor's act of effectively abolishing the constitutional offices of Secretaries of State and Treasury by reducing their budgets to zero was an act in excess of his constitutionally granted powers; (3) the Governor's act that reduced to zero the amount provided for State Aid to Schools was an unconstitutional act and was invalid; and (4) the Governor's action in reducing other line items that were not of a constitutional nature was valid. The Governor could strike parts of items, after passage by the Legislature, and insert a lump sum figure equal to the sum of the parts of items stricken.</SPAN></P>

The justice of the peace awarded the housing authority a judgment. The justice of the peace refused to allow the tenants to file an appeal when they could not post the bond required by W. Va.

The court rejected the tenants' argument that the proceedings before the justice of the peace did not provide due process because of his lack of legal training. The tenants were also not deprived of due process and equal protection when they were unable to post a bond because the amount specified by &sect; 50-15-2 was reasonably related to the housing authority's damages. However, because a justice of the peace received additional fees under W. Va. Code &sect; 50-17-1 when he rendered a judgment in favor of a plaintiff, he had a pecuniary interest in the outcome. That interest violated both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and W. Va. art. III, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner filed a demurrer to the judge's return and answer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner asserted that the indictment charged him with accepting a bribe as a deputy sheriff and that Code, 61-5-7, as amended, purported to prohibit any county official, either elected or appointed, from receiving or offering a bribe; therefore, he could not be indicted under the statute because a deputy sheriff was merely a county employee and was not a county official. The question of whether a deputy sheriff was a public official or an employee was moot because the legislature enacted the &quot;Bribery and Corrupt Practices Act,&quot; which included all government employees as well as public officials within the bribery statute, Code, 61-5A-2(2). However, no one reading the title of the Act could assume that the object of the Act related to bribery of a county official, either elected or appointed because that was not referred to in the title. The title referred specifically to the bribery of persons in certain positions; other county officials were not mentioned. Therefore, Code, 61-5-7, as amended, was void as to that part which was not mentioned in the title. The Act violated Article VI, &sect; 30 of the Constitution of West Virginia. Petitioner was entitled to the writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenants owed the landlord back due rent, and while they were away, the landlord had the justice of the peace issue a warrant of distress. The sheriff levied the tenants' personal property for sale at auction. The tenants filed a writ of prohibition, and the court awarded the tenants writ. The court found that the distress statute did not provide the tenant notice or the opportunity to have been heard in defense before their property was distrained upon. The court found that the procedure for the granting of a distress warrant that permitted property of a tenant levied upon and seized without prior notice or a hearing was in contravention of the West Virginia constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court found that W. Va. Code &sect; 37-6-12 constituted only a legitimized form of harassment to bring the tenants to the landlord's outstretched hand. The court did not pass the questions of equal protection and unreasonable search and seizure because if a notice and hearing was denied by the statute before the distraint took place, the issues of the tenant's indigency or the constable's right to break and enter locked premises were immaterial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought a writ of prohibition in the Common Pleas Court of Cabell County (West Virginia) to prevent his prosecution on five grand jury indictments under W. Va. Code art. 8A and 8B, ch. 16 (1931), which consisted of four drug possession charges and one for a sale. Defendant claimed that the statutes either classified misdemeanors as felonies, were promulgated in futuro ad infinitum, were vague, or were otherwise unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Articles 8A and 8B were repealed after defendant was arrested when the legislature replaced those laws with West Virginia's Uniform Controlled Substances Act, and defendant's motion to quash the indictments on essentially the same grounds was overruled. Defendant claimed that the legislature unconstitutionally delegated authority to the state's pharmacy board, that references to ever-changing federal laws voided the statutes for indefiniteness, and that a particular drug was outside the statutory scheme. On review, the court found that the state could validly adopt federal laws effective at the time of enactment, and that the legislature had the right to delegate its police and regulatory powers to boards and commissions with a relevant expertise, especially where public health, morals, safety and welfare were involved. The court held that nothing in either the First or Fourteenth Amendments to the federal constitution prohibited West Virginia from enacting a criminal penalty for possession of cannabis.</SPAN></P>

A small number of eligible voters cast votes for the office of sheriff, and the candidate received a majority of the votes. The candidate brought a mandamus proceeding to compel the county court commissioners to issue him a certificate of election. The trial court awarded the writ of mandamus.

Where &sect; 8, Article 10, chapter 3, code, 1931, as amended, provided for filling vacancies at the next general election and required notice thereof to be published, the failure to publish the notice did not affect the election's validity.

The court held that the act amending and reenacting &sect; 1, Article 2, Chapter 51 was unconstitutional, void, and of no effect because the legislature unconstitutionally had increased the number of judicial circuits at a session other than one &quot;next preceding any general election of the judges of said circuits&quot; as required by Article VIII, &sect; 14 of the West Virginia Constitution. Under Article VIII, &sect;&sect; 10 and 14 of the West Virginia Constitution, rearrangements of judicial circuits could be made effective only at the expiration of the regular elective terms of circuit judges.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The material facts were not disputed. Petitioners contended that because of the failure of the Clerk of the Circuit Court to provide for each absentee vote a return envelope bearing a printed declaration, and the failure of the voter to sign such declaration, all such absentee ballots were invalid and should not have been counted in the election in favor of the special levy. The statute in effect at the time of the election, 1963 W. Va. Laws ch. 64, art. 3, &sect; 6, provided that the absentee voter had to declare that he was a resident of a designated precinct and that he was entitled to vote at such precinct, that he was unable to vote in person, and that he had personally marked the enclosed ballot. Although the general rule was that mistakes and irregularities in election made by the voter could result in his ballot being destroyed, the errors of officials did not affect the election, if a fair election had been held. The statute which required the signature of the voter contained no express provision that the failure to comply with that requirement would result in a void ballot nor did it direct that it not be counted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The infants' mother and father divorced after the father became involved with another woman. The infants alleged that their father's present wife caused him to abandon them and to fail and refuse to give them the care, attention, love, and affection that he had formerly given them. Affirming the judgments below, the court found that no cause of action existed in the state at common law or by statute in favor of a minor child against a third person for alienating his parent's affections and that such a cause of action should be created, if at all, by statute, not judicial decision. The court determined the validity of &sect; 2a, which abolished actions for alienation of affections and breach of promise to marry, because both lower courts denied the infants' claim on the ground that their asserted cause of action was abolished by it and because its constitutionality and validity were challenged below. The court held that &sect; 2a did not violate W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 because the abolished actions did not affect or relate to an injury to any person in his person, property, or reputation and that the statute was a valid exercise of the legislature's power to change the common law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The building commission was authorized by 1971 W. Va.

The State officials refused to perform duties in order to effectuate the sale of the bonds. The commission sought a writ of mandamus to compel the State officials to perform their duties. The court awarded the writ, which required the State officials to perform their duties. The court stated that the State officials were required to publish notice for the solicitation of the bond sales as required by ch. 167, and that the State officials were under a mandatory, nondiscretionary legal duty to perform those functions required by the Act. The court held that the payment of the bond obligations by a portion of the profits from the sale of alcohol did not violate W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 4, and that the expenditure of such money was for a public purpose. The court also held that the operation and maintenance of highway buildings was incident to the construction and repair of the highway system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator alleged that in the criminal proceedings, which resulted in his conviction for the possession of cannabis, the circuit court's clerk appointed jury commissioners in violation of Code, 52-1-3. The jury commissioners were appointed to replace an ill commissioner, and another who had died. Upon the recommendation of a county bar association, other cases were resubmitted to a new grand jury for reindictment. On the grounds of irregularities pertaining to the jury commissioners and the grand jury, relator moved the circuit court to set aside his conviction, and the circuit court refused. The court denied the petition for the writ of prohibition. The writ would not lie because there were no further actions to be taken by respondents regarding relator's criminal case. A writ of prohibition was a remedy to prevent the doing of an act, and the writ could not be used as a remedy for acts already done. The court did not reach the issues regarding the appointment of the jury commissioners or the issue regarding the validity of the statute under which relator was convicted because of the disposition of the petition for the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner claimed that he was denied due process of law in a number of respects in the trial that resulted in his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner, an indigent, pleaded guilty to a motor vehicle offense before a justice of the peace, who committed him to the county jail for 30 days in lieu of fine and cost. He failed to appeal, but ultimately sought to be released from custody by a petition for habeas corpus claiming that the judgment was void because it was procured in a proceeding that violated his due process rights as the justice of the peace was not a licensed lawyer and was pecuniarily interested in the disposition of the case. The court held that the justice of the peace's lack of legal training and a license to practice law did not deprive the prisoner of due process because there was no constitutional or statutory requirement that he be so trained or licensed. However, it held that the prisoner's conviction was void because &sect; 4, art. 3, ch. 17B, Code, 1931, as amended (W. Va.), which entitled a justice of the peace to fees of 50 cents and two dollars in the event of a conviction of an accused, produced a pecuniary interest in the justice and were violative of the due process of law provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and W.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Rehearing was granted, the majority and dissenting opinions previously filed by the court were withdrawn, the final judgment of the circuit court dismissing the proceedings was reversed and set aside, and the proceeding was remanded to the circuit court with directions that the prisoner be released by the sheriff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">W. Va.

The state issued such bonds and started eminent domain proceedings against the property owners. The property owners sought a writ of prohibition to stop the eminent domain proceedings. The court granted the writ. The court held that W. Va. Code art. 6, ch. 5 (1931) conflicted with W. Va. Const. art.

The test was not whether a future legislature was required to make appropriations to state agencies to pay their rent on space in the new office building, but whether it had the authority to do so. The reason for the invalidity of the statute was in the authority of the legislature to make future appropriations. The special fund doctrine was not applicable in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted an ordinance imposing a tax on the gross revenue of public utilities. The company refused to pay the tax, claiming the ordinance was void under &sect; 3(g), which prohibited cities, towns, villages, and other State subdivisions from levying a license, net income, or any other tax on the business taxed under the Act. After the company refused to pay the tax, the city sought a declaration that &sect; 3(g) violated W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 30, because the Act's title embraced more than one subject. The company denied the Act was unconstitutional and counterclaimed for taxes it had paid pursuant to the ordinance. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court erred in ruling that the Act was unconstitutional. The Act's title provided that it was an act to repeal a prior act and to enact in lieu thereof a statute relating to an annual tax on incomes of certain carriers. Because the title stated that its object related to an annual tax on incomes of certain carriers, such language was sufficient to alert persons concerned that the legislature had the power to extend or withhold from the State's political subdivisions the right to impose a tax on carriers taxed under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court overruled the city's motion to affirm the circuit court's judgment. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The agent claimed that his charge in connection with the sale was a necessary expense under Chapters 125 and 126, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1969. The writ was awarded by the court. It noted that the duty to issue and sell the bonds, and to exercise discretion without specific directions or limitations in so acting, was imposed upon the Governor by the enactment of Chapters 125 and 126, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1969. The court also noted that, under &sect; 4, Article 3, Chapter 17, Code, 1931 (West Virginia), the Auditor was required to honor a valid requisition for the payment of any claim of the character mentioned in the statute. The court opined that the agent's charge was a necessary expense, and was valid and binding upon the State. It held that when a requisition for the payment of such expense was duly submitted and there were sufficient unexpended funds in the State Treasury to pay such claim, it was the mandatory duty of the Auditor to honor such requisition.</SPAN></P>

Next, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional because the title of the statute failed to make mention of any crime or penalty contained in the statute. Furthermore, the court held that the indictments were not valid under a common law conspiracy theory because the indictments failed to state that the crime was committed within the one-year statute of limitations.

Granting a writ of prohibition to the indictee that prohibited respondents from prosecuting the indictee under the indictment, the court held that sufficient facts were set forth in the verified pleadings to determine that the &quot;Buyer&quot; was a mere employee and not an executive and ministerial officer of the State as alleged in the indictment and that, therefore, no crime was charged in the indictment.

They maintained that he was an officer of the State and could be bribed under &sect; 61-5-5. The court found that the issue was whether or not the indictee fell within the definition of &sect; 61-5-5. The indictee was only a subdivision head of the Commission presided over by the Road Commissioner, who was merely a &quot;ministerial officer.&quot; There was no such public office as &quot;director of office services of the State Road Commission.&quot; The indictee was not a de jure officer of the State and could not have been &quot;an executive and ministerial officer&quot; of the State as provided by &sect; 61-5-5.

The allowance of extra compensation in such cases was prohibited by W. Va. Const. art.

The lease was signed by the then director of the department, the corporation's secretary, and the lessee's president. The new director later notified the lessee's new president that the lease was terminated and was void based on the previous director's lack of authority to enter into such an agreement. The lessee responded that the lease was valid and the lessors brought an action for declaratory judgment against the lessee, with the trial court finding in favor of the lessors, holding that the lease was void. The lessee appealed and the court affirmed, holding that the coal underlying the state forest was vested in the corporation and the director had no authority to execute the coal mining lease absent a direction of the corporation, or ratification by it. The court found that the action of the director was ultra vires and that the state was not bound on principles of estoppel because it was engaged in using the forest land in a governmental capacity as a natural resource for the benefit of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The primary defense asserted by respondents was that the Act violated &sect; 39 of Article VI of the Constitution of West Virginia, which essentially provided: And in no case shall a special act be passed, where a general law would be proper, and can be made applicable to the case. The court held that the taxpayers were entitled to mandamus relief because the Act was constitutionally valid. Specifically, whether a special act or a general law was proper generally was a question for legislative determination; and the court would not hold a special act like the Act void, as contravening &sect; 39, Art. VI. of the West Virginia Constitution, unless it clearly appeared that a general law would have accomplished the legislative purpose as well. The court reasoned that the general statute, Article 1, Chapter 10, Code, 1931 (West Virginia), relating to the establishment and maintenance of public libraries, was permissive in character and thus did not compel any &quot;governing authority either by itself or in cooperation with one or more other such governing authorities&quot; to establish a public library. Therefore, the Act was necessary to accomplish the legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The West Virginia Housing Development Fund Act, 1968 W. Va. Acts 5, created a governmental instrumentality to make or participate in the making of federally insured loans for development for residential housing for low and moderate income persons and families. The chairman contended that issuing bonds was unconstitutional because the Fund was not a public corporation and that the Act involved an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court held that, in light of the legislative purpose stated in &sect; 2 of the Act and the Act in its entirety, the Fund was a public corporation created for public purposes and did not violate the provisions of W. Va. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1. The legislature did not delegate to the Fund any purely legislative authority in violation of W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 because it provided standards to guide the Fund in the exercise of its discretion in the limited area of determining who were persons and families of low and moderate income. Thus, the chairman had a mandatory, nondiscretionary duty to execute the contracts for and on behalf of the Fund.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the motions to dismiss; and on appeal, the court reversed, holding that: 1) the officers were unable to avoid liability by claiming they were not properly elected; 2) although officers were not ordinarily held responsible for corporate debts, where the corporation defaulted on the debt a statute providing for such liability was not unconstitutional on its face; 4) the statute was constitutional on its face, and there was no proof that it was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable in its application.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the circuit court had promptly set relator's case for trial on three separate occasions and that, in each instance, the trial was postponed or prevented at the instance of relator. Therefore, the court rejected relator's assertion that the &quot;three term&quot; statute,&nbsp;&sect; 62-3-21, should be read in pari materia with the speedy trial statute,&nbsp;&sect; 62-3-1 (1931). The court determined that the time periods involved in the dismissal of the first and second indictments could not be counted in favor of the discharge of relator.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner entered into an agreement with an independent contractor for the relocation and reconstruction of a highway. After completing certain work on a mountain hillside, large volumes of water broke loose inside the mountain, came out through one or more mine entries, and overflowed certain areas of the city, including the owner's store.

The owner filed the instant action seeking to compel the commissioner to institute condemnation proceedings against it so that it could recover for these damages. The court sustained the commissioner's demurrer and denied the writ prayed for. The court held that inasmuch as there was no remedy provided by the legislative enactment for the state to pay for damages done to personal property in eminent domain proceedings, the constitutional provisions relating to such matters were not self-executing with regard to the state. Because the constitution prohibited suits against the state, a writ of mandamus to compel the state to institute eminent domain proceedings would have been unavailing.</SPAN></P>

The president, however, refused to pay the orders or warrants made out to them, claiming that the circuit court could not appoint the deputies because it constituted a non-judicial function. The court overruled the demurrer. The court held that although it was true that the sheriff could not compel the circuit court to consent to the permanent appointment of the deputies, the approval for temporary service only provided that the deputies would serve at the will of the sheriff in accordance with Code 6-3-2. The court held that the order did not appoint deputies for an indefinite time, but rather for a reasonable time necessary, and during that reasonable time, it gave the sheriff the power and authority to remove the deputies. The court also held that the deputies could not be deprived of payment because they had acted as de jure sheriffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus against defendant, a sheriff, seeking to be released from jail where he was confined awaiting execution of two concurrent indeterminate sentences for forcible rape under &sect; 15, Article 2, Chapter 61, West Virginia Code, 1931, and grand larceny.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the inmate was on probation for the rape charge, he was indicted for the grand larceny charge. After the inmate executed a guilty plea, his probation under the rape charge was revoked, and he was sentenced for both crimes. The inmate contended that he was denied the assistance of counsel when his probation was revoked. The inmate claimed that the intermediate court, which re-sentenced him to confinement after his probation was revoked, lacked authority to issue the re-sentence. The court determined that although the inmate was not entitled to be represented by counsel when he was placed on probation, he was entitled to have effective assistance of counsel when such probation was revoked. The court held that the inmate was entitled to assistance of counsel whether the proceeding was labeled a revocation of probation or a deferred sentencing inasmuch as his liberty was affected by the proceeding. The court found that under the rape statute, absent a jury verdict, the only sentence that the trial court was permitted to impose was a life sentence or a death sentence. The sentence imposed by the trial court, without a jury verdict, after the probation was revoked was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The writ was awarded. The inmate was discharged from the rape charge and sentence. In addition, the inmate was discharged from the grand larceny sentence but without prejudice to the State to take further proceedings against him under the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Marshall County (West Virginia), which affirmed the judgment of a common pleas court in favor of defendant landowner. The circuit court found that an ordinance of the city, which set fees and charges to provide additional revenue for continuous maintenance and improvements of street service within the city, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the ordinance, an unimproved vacant lot or any property that was not occupied was not subject to the fees provided for in the ordinance. However, all of the citizens, whether they owned or lived in property serviced under the ordinance, were subject to the fees for the services as users because the services furnished would be adjacent to the property. The circuit court relieved the landowner from paying the fees on the grounds that the classification of users in the ordinance was not a fair classification and that it was so arbitrary it violated Article X, &sect; 9 of the Constitution of West Virginia relating to uniformity. On appeal, the court held that the classification of occupiers of improved property as users of such services was valid and that charging them was reasonable. The provisions of Code 8A-5-8 contained in the city's charter, which authorized the enactment of an ordinance to charge and collect reasonable rates and fees for municipal services, had been complied with in a consistent manner. The charge of 25 cents a front foot of improved property abutting on the streets or avenues in the city was a reasonable charge for the services rendered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgments of the circuit court and the common pleas court. The court remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent, the Secretary of State of the State of West Virginia, to accept and file the certificate of relator as a candidate for the nomination to the office of judge of the thirty-first judicial circuit. The Secretary had refused to accept and file the certificate on the ground that the act creating the circuit was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Secretary refused to accept and file relator's certificate on the ground that Chapter 40, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1967 (Code, 1931, 51-2-1, as amended) (W.Va.) was unconstitutional. The Secretary's position was solely based on the fact that the Act superimposed the thirty-first circuit upon the identical territory that constituted the twenty-third circuit. The court held that the Act was constitutional and that relator was entitled to the writ of mandamus. There was nothing in the Constitution of West Virginia that precluded the enactment of the Act. Although all circuits, other than the first circuit, could only have one judge, there was no constitutional inhibition against the superimposition of one judicial circuit upon another. The increase in the number of circuits was provided for in Article VIII, &sect; 14 of the Constitution of West Virginia. Moreover, the Constitution of West Virginia was a restriction of power rather than a grant of power as was the federal Constitution. Therefore, the West Virginia Legislature could enact any measure that was not specifically prohibited by the state or federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

He was discharged from that imprisonment in a habeas corpus proceeding on the ground that the indictment charging the prisoner with having been an accessory before the fact to murder was void. The prisoner was again indicted upon a charge involving the same alleged murder as the first indictment. He pled guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. The prisoner sought a writ of habeas corpus. He argued, inter alia, that the former prosecutor, then judge should have been legally disqualified from presiding over the grand jury. The court rejected this argument, holding that the prosecutor in the prisoner's first case was not disqualified from presiding over the grand jury; he properly recused himself from the trial. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to give the prisoner credit for time served on the initial conviction. Further, the prisoner's plea of guilty to murder in the second degree was not responsive to the indictment. The plea was unwarranted by law and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator was convicted of malicious wounding. The prosecuting attorney filed an information pursuant to West Virginia's habitual criminal statutes, charging that relator had previously been convicted of a felony in California. Relator denied being the same person named in the information, but upon the testimony of a parole officer for the West Virginia Penitentiary, the circuit court determined that relator was the person named in the information. The court imposed an indeterminate sentence of two to 10 years on the malicious wounding conviction and imposed an additional term of five years due to the former conviction. Relator petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. In granting the writ, the court concluded that W. Va. Code, 1931, 61-11-19, clearly specified how the issue raised by the allegation of the information and the relator's denial of identity was to be determined. In unambiguous and imperative language, the statute required that a jury be impaneled to determine whether relator was the same person. Jurisdiction to determine that issue was conferred upon a jury to be impaneled for that purpose; no such jurisdiction was conferred upon a court acting in lieu of a jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The additional period of five years added to relator's sentence on the basis of the prior felony conviction was void and unenforceable, and relator was relieved in this habeas corpus proceeding from serving that portion of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

After the court awarded the writ, since time was of the essence, the court filed an opinion stating in more detail the reasons for its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The clerk would not comply with the resolution because, in his opinion, the bond issue, if approved, would have been for an unauthorized purpose contrary to the provisions of W. Va. Code &sect; 11-8-26, as amended. However, on consideration of the commissioners' application for a writ of mandamus, the court awarded the writ after rejecting the clerk's contention that the statute involved in the dispute, 1967 W. Va. Acts ch. 15, designated as W. VA. Code ch. 8, art. 11A, as amended, regarding the operation of a regional airport, violated the state constitution. Instead, the court held that the county could have been validly empowered by the legislature to participate with two other counties to finance and establish a regional airport. Specifically, the court held that the act at issue was not in contravention of W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 8 because the county had the power to issue revenue bonds for the establishment of the authority that would have operated the airport. Accordingly, the court held that the clerk was commanded to do what he was required by law to do to enable the voters of the county to vote upon the question of whether they would approve the issuance of such bonds.</SPAN></P>
