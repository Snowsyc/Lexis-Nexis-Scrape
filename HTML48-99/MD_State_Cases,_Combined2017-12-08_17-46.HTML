Regarding ethnicity or cultural heritage, defendant must identify and include himself in a particular cognizable group to pose questions relating to such. The trial court was not obliged to assign defendant's race, ethnicity, or cultural heritage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued writ of certiorari to Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) to resolve, among other issues, question of whether Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 645A, precluded appeal from final circuit court order ruling upon a motion to correct allegedly illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner had been sentenced to life imprisonment, although there had been the possibility of parole due to petitioner's cooperation in the trial of an accomplice. Subsequently, the Governor issued guidelines which, in effect, denied petitioner parole. Petitioner sought relief under the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 645-A (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), and under Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-345(a). The circuit court denied his petitions. The Court of Special Appeals held that the Circuit Court's ruling under Rule 4-345(a) was appealable and that petitioner's sentence had become illegal. The court affirmed the ruling as to petitioner's right to appeal, but still reversed the judgment, holding that petitioner's sentence was not illegal; as the sentence was legal when imposed and continually remained legal, a motion under Rule 4-345(a) to correct an illegal sentence was not an appropriate action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and case remanded with directions to affirm the judgment of the circuit court. Although intermediate court was correct in holding that circuit court's order upon a motion to correct allegedly illegal sentence was appealable, intermediate court was incorrect in holding that petitioner's sentence was illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant comptroller of the treasury appealed the ruling of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland) that appellant lacked the authority to assess additional income tax against appellee corporation, by imputing interest income from certain intercompany debt not reported on appellee's federal income tax returns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation was the parent company to many wholly-owned subsidiary companies. Appellee maintained four centralized, intercompany accounts with its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries deposited their proceeds in the appropriate account and then drew on that account to pay their related individual expenses. If a subsidiary deposited more proceeds than it withdrew, appellee maintained an interest-free debit with the subsidiary. If the subsidiary spent more money than it deposited, appellee maintained an interest-free credit with the subsidiary. For the tax years 1990-92, appellee maintained with its subsidiaries a credit in three of the four intercompany accounts. Appellant claimed that, under I.R.C. &sect;&sect; 482, 7872 (1999), it could assess income tax against these credits by imputing interest income from them. The court held that because income-determining statutes must be construed against the government, the appellant did not have the power to allocate income under I.R.C. &sect; 482 as the IRS does.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision affirmed; appellee's modified federal taxable income as reported on its consolidated tax returns did not reflect any income derived from I.R.C. &sect;&sect; 482 and 7872. Appellant could only allocate appellee's portion of that consolidated income based on the remaining applicable state code provisions pertaining to apportionment and modification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed conviction of various sexual offenses and denial of his motion to suppress evidence in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) arguing that solicitation of a prostitute by a potential customer was not a crime under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 15(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial indicated that defendant forced the victim into his car at the point of a knife, drove her into the woods against her will, and raped her. Defendant subsequently attempted to engage an undercover police officer, posing as a prostitute in a sting operation, in certain sexual activity. Evidence obtained as a result of his arrest for that endeavor incriminated him in the rape prosecution. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained after his arrest, arguing that being a prospective customer of a prostitute did not constitute a crime under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 15(e). The motion was denied and defendant appealed rape conviction. The court held that the crime of soliciting for prostitution stated in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 15(e) covered the conduct both of the prostitute in soliciting potential customers and of the potential customer in soliciting the prostitute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; court held that the crime of soliciting for prostitution covered the conduct of defendant potential customer in soliciting the prostitute, who was actually an undercover police officer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner motor vehicle administration petitioned for review of the lower court's decision overturning an administrative law judge's (ALJ) suspension of respondent's driver's license for failure to take a chemical breath test, pursuant to Md.

IV and the evidence of respondent's refusal to take the breath test should have been excluded from the proceeding. The court held that an administrative proceeding to revoke a driver's license was a civil proceeding, not a criminal proceeding. Therefore, the exclusionary rule did not apply because the exclusionary rule was a deterrent rule and its deterrent value would be minimal in proceedings with an administrative agency unrelated to the police department.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed the reversal on the ground that &quot;unwarranted hardship,&quot; as used in Anne Arundel County Code, art. 3, &sect; 2-107(b) (1996), required a property owner to be deprived of all reasonable use of their property before a variance could be granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subcontractor sought review of a decision by the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) invalidating plaintiff's mechanic's lien on residential property for failure to plead facts showing that the owner had not made full payment to the prime contractor at the time the notice of lien was given as well as the amount of the owner's indebtedness, as set forth in Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 104(a)(2) and (f)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subcontractor challenged the court of appeals' decision that plaintiff's mechanic's lien on defendant's residential home was invalid for failing to meet the procedural prerequisites of Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. &sect; 104(a)(2) and (f)(3). Upon further appeal, the court held that the appellate court erred in finding the complaint was deficient for failing to plead facts demonstrating that defendant owner had not made full payment to the prime contractor at the time plaintiff gave its notice of lien or that the lien did not exceed the amount of defendant's indebtedness. Neither of those facts could reasonably be expected to be within plaintiff's knowledge; therefore, plaintiff, as claimant, was not required to aver either in the complaint. A statutory presumption existed that the materials supplied by plaintiff were received by defendant and that the lien was valid, unless defendant presented rebuttal evidence, which did not occur in this case. The court reversed, reinstating the circuit court's decision that plaintiff's mechanics' lien was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision holding that plaintiff's mechanic's lien complaint was deficient because it failed to plead statutory prerequisites relating to defendant property owner's indebtedness to the prime contractor at the time plaintiff gave its notice of lien. Because the complaint adequately pleaded that plaintiff delivered the materials to defendant, a rebuttable statutory presumption as to the validity of the lien arose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the trial court's decision denying them a variance to build additional boats slips in a residential development in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area pursuant to restrictions imposed by the Anne Arundel County, Md., Zoning Code art. 3, &sect; 2-107 (b). On appeal, the court held that the Anne Arundel County Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA), which had granted the variance, had erroneously applied the wrong standard in reaching its decision. Under the Anne Arundel County, Md., Zoning Code art. 3, &sect; 2-107 (b), the &quot;unwarranted hardship&quot; standard rather than the &quot;practical difficulties&quot; standard should have been applied. Because the court lacked the authority to grant or deny a variance or substitute its judgment for that of the administrative body, the court remanded the case to the BZA for reconsideration and for application of the correct standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit certified three state law questions in a suit alleging an illegal taking of land under the Rails-to-Trails Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1247(d) (1983), asking (1) whether a deed conveying a railroad right-of-way conveyed an easement or fee simple; (2) if an easement, whether it was subject to any state law limitations; and (3) whether the easement was abandoned as a matter of law, and if so, when.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three questions were certified for decision under Maryland law by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in a suit brought under the takings clause of U.S. Const. amend. V: (1) whether a deed conveying a railroad right-of-way conveyed an easement or a fee simple; (2) if an easement, whether the conveyance was subject to any state law limitations on the use of the right-of-way; and (3) whether, as a matter of law, the railroad abandoned its easement prior to conveying it to defendants Montgomery County, Maryland, and the United States for interim use as a public recreational path under the Rails-to-Trails Act (the Act), 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1247(d) (1983). The state court of appeals answered all three questions in favor of defendants. By use of the language &quot;right of way,&quot; the deed conveyed a perpetual easement to the railroad. Use of the railway for recreational trails fell within the easement's intended purpose of transportation. The railroad did not abandon its easement by complying with the procedural requirements of the Act, because the Act expressly preserved a reversionary interest in favor of the railroad for future transportation purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's motion in limine to allow the testimony of a law professor regarding mitigating circumstances for sentencing. Defendant was convicted and appealed.

After contracts for the sale of two FCMA lots were finalized but before the lots were conveyed to the new owners without the FCMA obligations, appellant requested the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to withdraw the lots from the FCMA in order to avoid the imposition of a rollback tax. The court held that the intent of the original Conservation of Woodland Areas Act, in effect when appellant entered into his initial FCMA and during subsequent renewals, was to impose a rollback tax for property withdrawn for the purpose of conveyance, even if that conveyance was effected after the property technically was withdrawn. Under the interdependence and end result tests used in applying the step transaction doctrine, the transactions conducted by appellant were required to be stepped together and substantively considered one transaction: a withdrawal for the purposes of sale and conveyance. Accordingly, the rollback taxes were properly imposed.</SPAN></P>

Laws 632.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of common law assault and battery after the passage of 1996 Md. Laws 632. Petitioner, on certiorari review, argued that the statutory enactment abolished the common law crimes of assault and battery. While statutes were not presumed to repeal the common law further than required, where a statute dealt with an entire subject matter, the statute was generally construed as abrogating the common law as to that subject. 1996 Md. Laws 632 created degrees of assault unknown to the common law and repealed aggravated assaults. Under the previous statutory scheme, those assaults that fell outside the statute could still be prosecuted under the common law. Since enactment, all assaults fit within the statute, and the common law offenses were thus abrogated. Because the time frame during which the crime for which petitioner was convicted had commenced prior to enactment, the subject matter jurisdiction of the court was not defeated. Rather, the conviction was reversed based on the trial court's error in allowing the jury to speculate as to whether or not petitioner's conduct occurred prior to the date of enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's conviction was reversed because, although the common law offenses of assault and battery existed during part of the time frame when the conduct for which petitioner was convicted occurred, allowing the jury to speculate as to whether petitioner's conduct actually occurred in that period was error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a retailer of electronic and household goods and services. Respondent agency was the consumer protection division. Respondent brought an enforcement action under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (the Act), Md. Code Ann. Com.

The circuit court reversed that decision, which the court of special appeals then reversed. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. Principal among the multiple issues raised was the standard for determining deceptive advertising, particularly advertising that something was &quot;free.&quot; The parties argued over whether an ad was adjudged deceptive by a reasonable person standard or by an &quot;unsophisticated&quot; person standard. Semantics accounted for a large part of the gulf between the parties' positions. Upon review of the evolving approach by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to determinations of what was deceptive, the appellate court found that the standard in Cliffdale Associates and others was the standard for determining deception.

On petitioner's appeal, the appellate court reversed held that the intermediate court erred in reversing the trial court decision.

Petitioner appealed, claiming that the circuit court was required to determine whether there was a likelihood that mother would abuse child. Petitioner claimed that the circuit court's determination that mother posed no threat of death or fatal abuse to the child did not meet that requirement. The appellate court reversed. It explained that under Md. Code Ann., Fam.

The circuit court made no such determination regarding mother. The circuit court did not comply with &sect; 9-101, so the appellate court remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether mother was likely to abuse child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of statutory rape under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 463(a)(3) (1957 &amp; 1996 Repl. Vol.) after he had sexual relations with a girl under age 14. Appellant challenged his conviction, claiming that his right to due process was violated because the trial court prevented him from presenting his defense that he reasonably believed the victim was above 13 years of age. The appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that appellant's due process rights were not violated. Due process required that persons of ordinary intelligence and experience have a reasonable opportunity to know what actions were prohibited so that they could conform their conduct according to the law. Section 463(a)(3) clearly prohibited sexual intercourse with a child under age 14, informing appellant of the prohibited conduct and putting him on notice of the potential risks of miscalculating the victim's age. Additionally, &sect; 463(a)(3) made no provision for a mistake-of-age defense. The legislature's decision not to allow a mistake-of-age defense furthered the state's interest in protecting children from sexual abuse, so appellant's rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of denial of post conviction relief under Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 645A, in connection with an imposed death sentence for murder. Appellant claimed he was denied effective assistance of counsel through his attorney's failure to elicit evidence from a coroner about time of death and failure to present mitigating evidence of a dysfunctional childhood. The court noted evidence of appellant's guilt was almost entirely circumstantial, without an eyewitness or physical evidence to directly connect him to the murder itself. The court rejected appellant's argument that counsel's failure to impeach the coroner about a prior inconsistent statement fell below objectively reasonable representation. The court found no constitutional deficiency when the testimony estimating time of death at least two hours after appellant had possession of the victim's car was more exculpatory than inculpatory. The court noted that at that time state law allowed prior inconsistent statements only to impeach credibility not as substantive evidence. Court found counsel's presentation of mitigating evidence was based upon a presumed sound tactical decision to concentrate efforts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, respondents were physically detained by the police on the basis of probable cause to believe that each had participated in an illegal drug transaction. In both instances, the police searched respondents while they were detained and released them with the intention of later charging them with violation of the controlled dangerous substance laws of Maryland. The court below, in each of the respondent's respective cases, reversed respondents' convictions after it found that the initial detentions of respondents were not arrests, that the full search conducted by the police incident to those detentions were therefore unconstitutional, and, consequently, that the trial court had erred in denying appellants' motions to suppress. The judgments of the court below were reversed on appeal. The initial detentions of respondents were found to have been valid arrests. The court held that the failure of the police to subject appellants to the formal criminal charging process at the time of their valid arrests under Maryland law did not offend the U.S. Constitution. Consequently, the searches, as incident to lawful arrests, were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reversal of respondents' convictions for violations of Maryland's controlled dangerous substance laws, which was based on the lower court's determinations that the evidence against them should have been suppressed, was reversed. The court found that the failure of police to subject respondents to the formal criminal charging process at the time of their valid arrests did not negate the validity of the arrests or the incident searches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which affirmed her conviction for child abuse in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 35C. Petitioner, who had been convicted for failing to prevent the rape of a 12 year-old girl, that took place in her presence, argued that her omission or failure to prevent another person's act was not punishable under the language of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was found guilty of child abuse in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 35C for her failure to prevent the sexual molestation or exploitation of a 12 year-old girl. The facts adduced at trial showed that petitioner had sat on the edge of a bed and watched the 12 year-old victim being raped by petitioner's husband and a family friend. The evidence further showed that petitioner failed to intervene. Petitioner's conviction was affirmed by the court below. The judgment of the court below was affirmed on appeal because the court found that the definition of sexual abuse in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 35C contemplated not just an affirmative act in directly molesting or exploiting a child, but also one's omission or failure to act to prevent molestation or exploitation when it is reasonably possible to act. In addition, the trial judge was not found to have erred in allowing the prosecutor to tell the jury in closing argument that nobody had more of a reason to lie than petitioner because the comment was made in response to an attack on the credibility of witnesses first raised by the defense counsel in his closing argument. Moreover, the comment did not prejudice petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The affirmance of petitioner's conviction for child abuse by the court below was affirmed on appeal. The court's judgment was based on its finding that Maryland's child abuse statute's definition of sexual abuse contemplated one's omission or failure to act to prevent another's affirmative act in directly molesting or exploiting a child when it was reasonably possible to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county and others sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which granted appellee city and other appellees' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that appellee city's annexation of certain lands did not create a prohibited enclave in violation of Md. Code Ann. art. 23A, &sect; 19(a)(2) (1957).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented upon review was whether an annexation by appellee city, which left an area of appellant county separated from the rest of the county by waterways on three sides and appellee on the other, violated Md. Code. Ann. art. 23A, &sect; 19(a)(2) (1957), because it created the type of enclave prohibited by that statute. The court held that the plain language of &sect; 19(a)(2), and the legislature's intent in enacting the statute, prevented only an annexation by a municipality that would create an enclave of unincorporated land entirely surrounded by that municipality's borders. The statute did not prohibit annexation when areas left unincorporated would be separated from other unincorporated areas by natural features, i.e. physical geography alone. The court found that the separation of fast land areas by a body of water did not alter appellant's jurisdiction over all the lands, including the waterways, in question. Those segments of fast land and navigable water remain contiguous. Therefore, the court concluded that the annexation by appellee did not violate &sect; 19(a)(2). Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment, which granted appellee city and other appellees' motion for summary judgment, was affirmed. Under the plain meaning of the statute in question, the annexation by appellee city did not create a prohibited enclave because it did not create an unincorporated area completely surrounded by appellee city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant University of Maryland appealed a decision from the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland), pursuant to a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals, which granted plaintiff newspaper's request for information pursuant to the Maryland Public Information Act, Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-611 through &sect; 10-628. Plaintiff filed a cross-appeal, challenging the denial of its request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court granted the request of plaintiff newspaper for information including records of campus parking violations committed by the men's basketball team and its head coach, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Gov't &sect; 10-611 through &sect; 10-628. Defendant University of Maryland appealed, contending that either the before-mentioned statute or 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1232(g), authorized the nondisclosure of the information. Defendant claimed that any records concerning parking tickets received by the coach were exempt from disclosure under &sect; 10-616(i) because they constituted personnel records. The court held that a parking ticket merely charged a very minor misdemeanor and was not a personnel record. Defendant further argued that the records regarding the students contained financial information and thus were exempt from disclosure under &sect; 10-617(f). The court held that records of parking tickets were not records of indebtedness, and thus were not financial information. &quot;Education records&quot; within the meaning of 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1232(g), did not include records of parking tickets or correspondence regarding a student-athlete accepting a loan to pay parking tickets. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision below granting plaintiff newspaper's request for information, on the grounds that none of the statutes asserted by defendant University of Maryland authorized the non-disclosure of the information. The court denied plaintiff's cross-appeal for attorney fees on the ground that while plaintiff substantially prevailed, defendant's position was not wholly unwarranted, thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner's good conduct rates were based on that single term of confinement, and he was released under mandatory supervision on July 7, 1997. Based on case law, filed 20 months later, the correctional officials determined that the prisoner's sentences should not have been aggregated, and they recalculated his good time credits accordingly. The officials issued a retake warrant for the arrest of the prisoner as an escapee. The trial court granted the prisoner's petition for habeas corpus and ordered that the prisoner's mandatory supervision release be reinstated. The correctional officials appealed. The court held that (1) the correctional officials erred when they recalculated the prisoner's credits so as to deprive him of the liberty to which he was statutorily entitled, and (2) the prisoner's re-incarceration was unlawful because it was not authorized by statute, so he was entitled to release for that reason.</SPAN></P>

Following a review of the custody arrangement, as agreed upon by the parties, a doctor recommended that physical custody of the children be transferred to the mother. The father refused to accept the recommendation or relinquish the children. The mother thus filed a petition for modification. The court held (1) the trial court erred as a matter of law in ordering that custody of the children be transferred from the father to the mother because the trial court impermissibly relied on the mother's gender as the basis for its decision, (2) the trial court's reliance on the mother's gender as the basis for its decision violated the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment, Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and (3) the trial court's reliance on the mother's gender did not constitute harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared in court in contempt proceedings for failure to pay court-ordered child support before a master. The master found defendant in contempt and ordered him to be held in custody. Defendant physically resisted the attempt to take him into custody. He was convicted of battery by the trial court. An appellate court vacated his conviction, on the ground that the arrest was illegal because masters had no authority to order arrests. On review, the court affirmed, holding that masters had no express authority under Md. R. Fam. L. Actions 9-207 or Md. R. Civ. P., Cir. Ct. 2-541(c) or implicit authority to order arrests pending an entry of judicial order in accordance with their recommendation of contempt.

The trial court tried and convicted defendant in absentia and, at sentencing, disregarded his explanation for failing to appear at trial, which was that he had a seizure. Defendant appealed. The court held that 1) a criminal defendant could be tried in absentia after waiving his right to be present at trial, 2) before trying a defendant in absentia, a trial court was required to find a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to be present and to exercise sound discretion in determining whether to proceed with trial, 3) voluntary absence could not be presumed, and a waiver was required to be clearly established in the record, and 4) the trial court's inadequate inquiry into defendant's whereabouts on the morning of trial did not give it a sufficient basis to conclude that his absence was the product of voluntary choice.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the landlord had abandoned his right to an exemption for the CON requirement and reversed the finding of the trial court. The court held that the landlord's exemption as to the CON requirement for the existing nursing home facility was an incorporeal hereditament, which was personal, did not run with the land, and was subject to abandonment. When the landlord became unqualified to hold an operator's license by reason of criminal conviction for Medicaid fraud and acquiesced in the obtainment of a CON by subsequent operators, the landlord waived his right to an exemption.</SPAN></P>

The court of special appeals held that the state's Medicaid subrogation right under Md. Code Ann. Health-Gen. I &sect; 15-120 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed the award of subrogation funds to health maintenance organization. The court held that: 1) &sect; 15-120's requirement that money be held from settlement proceeds did not deprive recipient or her attorney of a significant property interest because when recipient asserted a right to recover for medical expenses, she was asserting a right which belonged to the state to the extent of any payments under the Medicaid program; 2) the obligation to hold sufficient funds from the settlement proceeds to satisfy the state's subrogation claim did not violate due process principles because nothing was filed with a court and no lien attached; and, 3) health maintenance organization had a subrogation right under &sect; 15-120, as validly assigned by the state, because it was acting as an agent or administrator for the state in providing medical care to indigent persons and in collecting back any payments received for medical treatment from responsible third parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of common law battery for punching a man who had denied his request for money.

The trial court sentenced defendant to 10 years imprisonment for the battery conviction and a consecutive 90-day term of imprisonment for the panhandling conviction. Defendant appealed, arguing that his sentence on the battery conviction should have merged with his sentence on the panhandling conviction because common law battery was a lesser-included offense. The appellate court disagreed and affirmed defendant's sentences. The court vacated defendant's aggressive panhandling conviction, holding that (1) the &quot;required evidence test&quot; was inapplicable to a merger question involving a state common law or statutory offense and an offense created by a local ordinance; (2) under the rule of lenity, defendant could not have been sentenced for both offenses because the convictions were based on the same act; and (3) defendant's aggressive panhandling conviction could not have stood because art. 19, &sect; 249 was repealed and it had no savings clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A marina received approvals and permits from state and federal officials to construct an expansion. The county denied a building permit, stating that the expansion violated Anne Arundel County, Md., County Code &sect; 5-108(e), in that the expansion was closer than one-half mile to an oyster bed. The marina appealed the denial of a variance by filing an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was invalid. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment and, on petition for certiorari, the court vacated with instructions to dismiss. The court held that a declaratory judgment action would not lie, as the administrative and judicial review procedures were exclusive pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 25A, &sect; 5(U) (1957). Even if the marina had followed proper procedure, it would not be entitled to relief, as the county's zoning power extended to regulation of the situs of piers and the number of boat slips, and the local ordinance was not preempted by state law.</SPAN></P>

The case was brought in reliance upon the Religious Corporations Law, Md. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-301 to 3-336 (1975 &amp; 1993 Repl.), specifically Md. Code &sect;&sect; 3-301 to 3-313.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the local church, and the appeals court reversed that decision. On review, the court noted that the national church was a hierarchical, connectional denomination, and that the local church bought the property. The court ruled that the appeals court erroneously concluded that the local church's charter caused the property to be held in trust for the national church. The charter did not contain an explicit reverter provision, and its meaning was doubtful. Under Md. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3-301 to 3-313, the trustees of the local church were entitled to own, use, and control the property upon withdrawal from the denomination absent express or implied contracts with the national church to the contrary. None of the three common law grounds for transfer of local church property to the denomination upon withdrawal was established.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen, as representative of a class of persons who allegedly paid wrongly charged fees to defendant sheriffs, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland), which granted the sheriffs' motion for summary judgment dismissing the citizen's claim for damages for fees wrongfully collected by the sheriffs, plus attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed the action for himself and other persons who had paid fees to sheriffs in the state for serving process in motor vehicle prosecutions, seeking damages representing compensation for the fees paid, plus attorney's fees. The citizen claimed that the sheriffs were prohibited from charging those fees by Md. Code Ann., Transportation &sect; 26-410 (1977). The trial court granted the sheriffs' motion for summary judgment on the ground that Md. Code Ann., Courts and Judicial Proceedings &sect; 7-402 (1973) authorized collection of the fees. The court vacated the judgment and remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint, costs to be paid by the citizen. The trial court should not have decided the merits of the claim. There was no statute authorizing a suit of this nature, no common law action lay for recovery of taxes or governmental fees paid under mistake of law, and the statute providing administrative refund remedies covering every type of improperly-charged tax or fee collected by a state entity was the exclusive remedy for the wrong alleged by the citizen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with robbing the office of two teachers in a local high school, and was convicted on two counts of misdemeanor theft and one count of trespassing. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of 18 months on each of the misdemeanor theft convictions and a concurrent 60-day sentence for the trespassing. The appellate court applied the single larceny doctrine (doctrine) and merged the two theft convictions, but otherwise affirmed the judgments. The court granted the state's petition for certiorari to consider whether the doctrine was properly applied by the court of special appeals. The doctrine essentially provided that the stealing of several articles of property at the same time, belonging to several owners or the same owner, ordinarily constituted one offense. The court affirmed the judgment and held that, although application of the doctrine depended on the factual circumstances presented, the single larceny doctrine was a part of Maryland common law and, therefore, the appellate court did not err in applying the doctrine to the facts before it.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested, and filed a motion to suppress the evidence, arguing the search warrant was an anticipatory warrant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers argued that the circuit court's compliance order constituted a preliminary or interlocutory injunction that violated certain rules regarding injunctions, such as Md.

The court held that the compliance order violated the Maryland Rules regulating injunctions. Further, the order was unauthorized by Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to killing an individual while robbing a home. On appeal, the court held that the detective's suggestion to reduce his confession to writing in order to tell the story in his own words could be interpreted as a neutral attempt to avoid later disagreement as to the particulars of defendant's oral confession and that it did not overbear defendant's free will, nor did it render the subsequent written confession involuntary. The court found that the mere fact that some asportation occurred before the use of force did not mean that the perpetrator was thereafter not guilty of the offense of robbery but rather that the totality of the circumstances that surrounded the taking had to be considered. The court determined that the trial court did not err in refusing to propound a requested jury instruction on an uncharged lesser offense of theft because there was no rational basis upon which the jury could have concluded that defendant was guilty of theft, but not guilty of robbery. The court concluded that defendant's failure to avail himself of the opportunity to confront the victim impact witnesses did not translate into a denial of his right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was injured when a car driven by her mother was involved in a collision.

The court reaffirmed the parent-child tort immunity, holding that it was still in the best interests of both children and parents to retain that rule. Abrogating immunity would result only in further discord within the family and would interfere with the exercise of parental discretion in raising and disciplining children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed two occupants of a home which he had burglarized. Using a verdict sheet designed for a single victim, and modified by the court and the parties to accommodate multiple victims, the jury found defendant a principal in the first degree to the murder of each victim, and imposed a single sentence of death in accordance with the form. The trial court, finding the verdict and death sentence applicable to each victim, imposed two death sentences. On review, the court conceded that the form used was improper, but rejected defendant's contention that the jury might have assessed two life sentences in separate sentencing determinations. All factors considered by the jury applied to both victims; thus, the court concluded that the appropriate remedy was to vacate one of the death sentences. It was not error to fail to instruct the jury on depraved heart murder, effectively depriving the jury of the option of convicting on a lesser included offense, where there was no rational basis for the jury to convict only on that offense, given the sufficient evidence of first-degree murder and the judge's having instructed the jury on two other varieties of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of conviction.

The action arose out of a determination by a hearing examiner that over $ 1.2 million in overpayments to the respondent, a county board of education, was owed to the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the endorsement by the secretary of the state department of personnel (personnel) of the hearing examiner's decision, the county board of education sought judicial review. The lower court granted the state's motion to dismiss, holding that judicial review of the department of personnel's decision was precluded by prior caselaw. The board appealed and the court of special appeals reversed, holding that the department's decision was subject to judicial review. On appeal, the court reversed and held that language in a prior opinion by the court on the issue was not dicta, as it had been characterized by the court of special appeals. The court held that the general assembly could preclude judicial review in certain instances. The court held that the allocation and control of public funds, and the resolution of disputes among state government agencies and instrumentalities concerning such funds, were matters which the general assembly could fully control by legislation. The court held that the department's decision in this case was not subject to judicial review under either statutory provisions or the principles set forth in prior caselaw.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union appealed a judgment of the Special Court of Appeals (Maryland) which held, in favor of defendants, a health care corporation and nurse placement service, that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 150-161, preempted the Maryland anti-strikebreakers statute, Md. Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 4-403 (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union filed suit arguing that the placement service was tortiously interfering with the collective bargaining negotiations between the union and the corporation in violation of &sect; 4-403. The corporation intervened to ally with the placement service. On the motion of the corporation and placement service, the trial court dismissed the union's complaint for failure to state a claim and federal preemption. On the union's appeal, the appellate court affirmed solely on the basis of federal preemption. When the union again appealed, the court held that: (1) the appellate court improperly reached the constitutional questions which the union's complaint raised when the controversy could have been decided without addressing such constitutional issues; (2) the allegations that the union pled in its complaint did not present a justiciable controversy because there was no strike and no &quot;strikebreaking&quot; nurses for the placement service to supply in derogation of such a job action; and (3) the arguments in the union's appellate brief could not be read to state a claim under &sect; 4-403 because to do so required an impermissibly broad reading of a criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) held that ch. 491 was not unconstitutional. The association, chapter, and individual members filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association, chapter, and individual members contended that 1995 Md.

They also argued that the statute violated their rights to due process of law because they had obtained a property interest in their employment and would lose their jobs under a pilot program for privatization of certain child support enforcement services. The court found that 1995 Md. Laws ch. 491 did not violate the single subject requirement because the objective of improved child support enforcement had a sufficient nexus with the balance of the legislation to constitute part of the single subject of welfare reform. The court further found no federal or state due process violation. It reasoned that there was no right to continued state employment protected by a theory of substantive due process; moreover, an employee who lost his job was not entitled to a hearing when the position was abolished pursuant to a bona fide government reorganization or kindred cost-cutting measure. The court observed that the association, chapter, and individual members had notice of the threat to their jobs and opportunities for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

In addition, defendant allegedly killed another man in the street. The court found that the trial court's refusal to admit a statement by defendant that someone other than defendant was in possession of his guns on the night in question was proper because the doctrine of verbal completeness did not allow evidence otherwise inadmissible as hearsay to be admitted. It was not error for the trial court to join defendant's two murder offenses for trial because under the mutual admissibility test evidence concerning both offenses would have been admissible in a separate trial for each offense. Next, the court found that the evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for burglary because the evidence of breaking was insufficient. However, the evidence was sufficient to convict for robbery and robbery with a deadly weapon. Evidence of defendant's juvenile record should have been excluded, and was highly inflammatory requiring the reversal of defendant's death sentence and the grant of a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of supervisors of elections (board) determined that the citizen had not obtained a sufficient number of signatures to place the ordinance at issue before the electorate. The board's method of determining whether referendum petitions met the requisite number of qualified signatures was to compare the names on a submitted petition with the city's list of registered voters as of the date the petition was filed. The citizen argued that the names of unqualified voters should have first been removed from the master list. On appeal, the court first found that the lower court had proper jurisdiction of the appeal because Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 12-301 (1995), which limited the right to appeal an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency or local legislative body pursuant to a statute, ordinance, or charter provision, was not applicable in the instant case, which was a traditional common law mandamus action. The court found that the voter registration lists were presumed to be the lists of all qualified voters at any given point in time as long as reasonable procedures were available to periodically delete from the lists the names of unqualified voters.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner argued that the regulation of commercial speech was an invalid prior restraint that violated the Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 40 and U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner store relocated and sold off its inventory prior to relocation. Petitioner advertised its sale in a newspaper as a &quot;liquidation&quot;. Respondent county's code required merchants to obtain a license prior to advertising a &quot;closing out sale&quot;; respondent's code stated that respondent &quot;may&quot; grant a license if respondent was satisfied that the proposed sale was consistent with the proposed advertising. Petitioner did not obtain such a license and was fined. Petitioner sought review unsuccessfully in the district court and the intermediate appellate court. Respondent claimed that the advertisement was a misrepresentation calculated to deceive the public, and it did so because petitioner did not use every means possible to rid itself of all inventory. The court reversed and held that respondent's code did not directly advance respondent's interest in protecting consumers from deceptive advertising. The restriction of words such as &quot;liquidation&quot; did little to prevent false advertising. The court noted that respondent conceded that petitioner was fined for using the word liquidation in its unlicensed advertisement and not because the advertisement was misleading.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights the code was not narrowly drafted to achieve its ends, and the code did nothing to directly advance respondent's interest in protecting consumers from deceptive advertising.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, landowners and non-profit organizations, challenged the decision of defendant Maryland Department of the Environment to issue two permits authorizing the construction of a solid waste incinerator. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County dismissed the action for lacking of standing. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland). Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which the court granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the circuit court should have affirmed the administrative decision rather than dismiss the action for lack of standing. The court concluded that if the administrative law judge (ALJ) was rendering findings and conclusions on the plaintiffs' entitlement to maintain an action in court, rather than their standing to be parties at the administrative hearing, then the ALJ exceeded her proper role. The determination of whether plaintiffs had standing to maintain an action in court was exclusively a judicial function. Thus, the appellate court erred in holding that any deference could be given to the administrative decision concerning plaintiffs' lack of standing. The court ruled that the fact that the level of pollutants from the incinerator falling on nearby property may be &quot;acceptable&quot; under governmental air quality standards, thereby justifying the issuance of the permits, was not the test for plaintiff's standing to seek judicial review. Instead, the test was whether the plaintiffs were affected in a way different from the public generally. The administrative record showed that nearby property owners would be affected in a way different from the general public.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's conviction and sentence of defendant without prejudice to his ability to raise certain issues on post conviction review. There was no discretional abuse in the lower court's restriction of the scope of voir dire based on the absence of a reasonable likelihood of uncovering a disqualification in connection with another class of crime. Defendant's objections as to the inadmissibility of recorded conversations and ineffective assistance were not properly before the court. The record was inadequate to address such issues, which were risible on post conviction review. Nor did the lower court err in refusing to conduct a belated suppression hearing, in admitting a co-conspirator's deposition statements as hearsay exceptions, or in admitting fingerprint comparison evidence, given defendant's waiver of a right to a limiting instruction. Defendant's remaining contentions as to the jury instructions, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the constitutionality of the death penalty were meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The racehorse owner contended that the commission's order was invalid because the legislature had not explicitly authorized the commission to impose a fine upon a racehorse owner. However, the court rejected the racehorse owner's contention. The court held that Md. Code Ann., Bus. Reg. &sect; 11-210 broadly authorized the commission to adopt regulations to govern racing and betting on racing in the Maryland and then specified four types of regulations that the commission could not adopt. The court held that regulations promulgated under such a broad grant of authority were valid if they did not contradict the statutory language or purpose. On that basis, the court concluded that the commission's regulation authorizing the imposition of a $ 5,000 fine upon a racehorse owner who engaged in the type of deceptive misconduct at issue in this case was valid.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the rule that a man could not marry his niece applied to half-blood relationships and that such a marriage was prohibited by the statute.

In reaching this decision, the court rejected the argument that the city board had improperly retroactively applied &sect; 3-17A. The court also held that &sect; 3-20 had not, as the state board argued, made regular periodic voting a condition for voter eligibility because inactive voters were not ineligible to vote if they continued to meet the constitutional qualifications for voting. Finally, the court found that the state board's order was unlawful because it contradicted the conditions established for a voter purge under &sect; 3-17A.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee suffered a lifting injury while working as a nurse at a hospital. She felt a pull and suffered minor discomforts in her neck and shoulder at the time of the incident and sought medical care several months later. An exam showed nothing remarkable and she continued her work. Almost two years after the accident, tests revealed that she had disc herniation and a spur on her spine. More than two years after the accident, the employee filed a workers' compensation claim. On appeal of the lower court's finding that her claim was properly rejected under the two-year statute of limitations found in Md. Code Ann. Lab. &amp; Empl. &sect; 9-709, the court examined legislative history and the purpose of the law to hold that the two-year period did begin to run from the date of the accident. The employee argued that it ran from the date she discovered that she had a compensable injury. The court ruled that predictability was the cornerstone of the Workers' Compensation Act and that the interpretation was consistent with the plain words of the statute. The court also ruled that the statute was not unconstitutional because it was rationally related to a legitimate government objective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for his participation in a drive by shooting and on appeal contested his sentence of life imprisonment. The court found that under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 38 (1957), conspiracy was punishable to the maximum penalty for the substantive underlying crime. Under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 412(b) (1957), life imprisonment was the minimum penalty for murder. Defendant, however, argued that under the old version of Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 38 (1957) punishment for conspiracy was limited to 10 years and that this limit was merely repealed to avoid sentences that were greater than that imposed for the substantive crime. Defendant pointed to the unavailability of the death penalty for a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder to bolster his argument. The court found that it was just as logical to conclude that the legislature repealed the 10 year limit on sentences for conspiracy out of a desired to punish those who conspire to commit criminal acts as severely as those who commit them. Furthermore, the court found it more probable that the legislature did not authorize the death penalty for conspiracy because of the unique nature of that punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped before he entered a prison facility and was informed that the state police would perform a &quot;canine sniff&quot; of his vehicle. Although defendant objected and asked to leave the facility, the sniff was performed. As a result, drugs were found that were introduced at defendant's trial. The court held that absent reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity, it was unreasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 26 to detain defendant whom, prior to entering the prison, indicated a preference to leave rather than submit to the detention. The detention was an illegal seizure. The court rejected the state's argument that the detention was permissible under the exception to the search and seizure rule for detaining motorists at checkpoints. The reasonableness of a checkpoint detention was determined by balancing the intrusion of the motorist's privacy interests against the societal need served by the seizure. Defendant's seizure was not designed to serve the state's articulated interest in keeping drugs out of its correctional facilities because that purpose was fully served once defendant agreed to turn away from the prison building.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the legislature intended a forfeiture petition for money or currency, to include the filing of an executed show cause order, as opposed to a proposed one, along with the complaint and affidavit, within ninety days of the date of final disposition of a criminal proceeding. The county argued on appeal that, in light of the plain meaning of the forfeiture statute and the fact that the complaint and the affidavit provided a basis on which a judge would execute a show cause order, the legislature intended that a proposed, not an executed, show cause order, be filed with the complaint and the affidavit. The court held that the forfeiture statute,&nbsp;Md. Code, Art. 27, &sect; 297(d)(2)(i), characterized, without limitation, the summons component of the application for a forfeiture petition as a show cause order. In so doing, the legislature indicated its intention that an actual show cause order, i.e., one that had been executed by the court, be filed, as part of the application, within 90 days of the final disposition of the criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court granted the media, including appellant, access to a juvenile proceeding on the condition that the juvenile in question was not referred to by his full legal name.

The lower court issued an order denying only appellant access to the proceedings after appellant refused to publish the court's order. The court found that a judicial order conditioning access to a juvenile proceeding upon the required publication of specific material was unconstitutional to the same extent as an order conditioning access upon a restraint from publication. The court concluded that as appellant did not technically violate the court's first order as there was not ban on photos and the juvenile's legal name was not published, appellant should have been given access on the same basis as other members of the press. The court vacated the order denying appellant access to the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner vehicle administration sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which reversed an administrative law judge's decision from a probable cause hearing held pursuant to Md. Code Ann. Transport. I &sect; 16-205.1(f)(7) that gave greater credit to the sworn written statement of an absent police officer, who had not been subpoenaed by either party, than to the conflicting testimony of respondent driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent driver was pulled over for a traffic violation by a police officer. The officer came to believe that respondent had been driving while intoxicated and noted those observations on the appropriate forms, which respondent signed, and requested that respondent take a blood alcohol concentration test (test), which respondent refused. The officer was not subpoenaed for the probable cause hearing held pursuant to Md. Code Ann. Transport. I &sect; 16-205.1(f)(7), but the forms and respondent's record from his prior refusal were submitted. The administrative law judge (ALJ) suspended respondent's license for a year. The trial court reversed, finding the suspension unsupported by competent material evidence. The court reversed because the officer's sworn statement was prima facie evidence of a test refusal, which was sufficient to establish that respondent refused to take the test. The court held that the officer's sworn statement provided adequate support for the ALJ's conclusion that respondent was fully advised of the consequences of a test refusal, notwithstanding respondent's testimony to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court issued a mass consolidation order applicable to 8,555 actions involving claims for personal injuries or wrongful death allegedly resulting from exposure to asbestos. In a trial to determine common issues of liability, the parties also agreed to dispose of the claims of six illustrative users and/or bystanders. Following trial, judgment was entered granting compensatory damages to three of the six and imposing liability for punitive damages against a manufacturer and a supplier/installer. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the judgments with regard to compensatory damages with a single exception. A finding of liability of one manufacturer as to one user/bystander was reversed, because there was insufficient evidence that he had been exposed to that manufacturer's product. The court reversed the judgments for punitive damages, finding no evidence of bad faith or actual malice. The court held that the consolidation did not result in a denial of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff union appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland), which vacated an arbitrator's award of compensation for lost wages and benefits to police employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement with defendant county because a furlough breached this agreement. The union filed a notice of appeal with the intermediate appellate court. This court granted its petition for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted a furlough plan in violation of a collective bargaining agreement with the union, pursuant to Baltimore County Code &sect; 25-51, prohibiting the furlough of police officers in exchange for a freeze on cost-of-living adjustments and providing for arbitration of disputes, pursuant to &sect; 25-59. The union's grievance challenging the county action was submitted to an arbitrator, who awarded compensation to the union. On appeal, the court held that the county was bound by the contract prohibiting the furlough of police officers. Although the provision prohibiting furloughs did affect compensation, the grievance was subject to arbitration. Funds were appropriated in the county's budget for the police compensation without any furloughs, as required by the agreement. The county exercised its legislative discretion under the county charter by enacting a budget including funds to compensate the employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. The subsequent arbitrator's decision was consistent with the enacted budget. Baltimore County Charter &sect; 714 did not authorize the county to breach its contracts unilaterally or to reduce appropriations in an enacted budget.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to that court for proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. Costs were to be paid by the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his sentence rendered by the Circuit Court for Caroline County (Maryland) following a jury conviction for first degree murder and a sentence of death imposed by the same jury. Appellant was previously convicted of robbing the victim, who was his former classmate. He was indicted for murder eight years after the victim's disappearance when the victim's body was discovered in a park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant robbed and killed his former classmate and was found guilty of robbery and theft after the victim's belongings were found in his possession. The victim's body was found eight years after the robbery. Appellant did not testify at his trial before a jury. He was found guilty of both premeditated murder and felony murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court found that conversations between appellant and a witness were not excluded from evidence by the Sixth Amendment and reasoned that appellant's right to counsel had not attached because the charges of false statements and murder were not closely related. Uncharged misconduct evidence was properly admitted at trial for the purpose of showing appellant's state of mind. The trial court erred when it strictly applied the rules of evidence and did not admit hearsay evidence at the capital sentencing hearing because the word &quot;evidence&quot; in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413(c) did not require that the strict rules of evidence were to be followed. The court found that the trial was not a double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for premeditated murder and felony murder. The court vacated the death sentence because the trial court had erred by strictly applying the rules of evidence at the capital sentencing hearing and ruling that certain hearsay evidence was inadmissible even though it was probative. The court remanded the case for a new sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

At the hearing, the driver acknowledged receipt of a prior restricted license within the past five years. He argued that the current charge was not a second offense because his license was not suspended in the first proceeding. The administrative hearing officer and the trial court held that &sect; 205.1 rendered the driver ineligible for a restricted license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment from the Circuit Court for Somerset County (Maryland), which granted appellee county's petition for civil forfeiture of his property, under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297 (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol.), after he pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity to indicate an intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 286 (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to consider whether Maryland's drug forfeiture statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 297 (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol.), was subject to an excessive fines analysis, pursuant to the Eighth Amendment and/or Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 25. The appellant argued that the county failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that he acquired the property during the period he was violating the law and that there was no other source for the acquisition of the property. The court held that: (1) the statutory presumption as to the forfeitability of property had no relevance to establishing its ownership; (2) the civil in rem forfeiture statute was partially intended as punishment; and (3) that the statute purported to limit the size of property that could be taken did not shield the forfeiture from Eighth Amendment review. The court examined the instrumentality and proportionality tests, favored the multi-factor test using a variety of proportionality factors, but declined to devise its own new test for determining the constitutional excessiveness of particular forfeitures. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment rendered by the trial court, which granted the county's petition for civil forfeiture of the appellant's property, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, insurance commissioner, human relations commission, and the National Organization for Women (NOW), and cross-appellant insurer sought a writ of certiorari from the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which reversed in part a decision of appellant insurance commissioner and held that Md. Ann. Code art. 48A &sect;&sect; 223(b)(2), 226(c)(2), and 234A(b) did not violate the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment, Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 46.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Human Relations Commission (HR Commission) found that an insurer was discriminatorily determining rates and accessibility to disability and life insurance. An administrative appeals board affirmed. On appeal the circuit court held that the HR Commission did not have jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Insurance Commission. (Ins. Commission) The Ins. Commission determined that the disability issues were moot because the insurer no longer provided such coverage and that rates for genders could differ if actuarially based. The insurer, the HR Commission, and NOW filed for judicial review. The circuit court affirmed in part but held that the Ins. Commission lacked authority to determine constitutionality of statutes. On writ of certiorari the court ruled in part in favor of the insurer and vacated the remainder of the decision. The court agreed that the disability issue was moot. The court found that the Ins. Commission had authority to determine constitutionality. And finally, the court found that challenged statutes were not applicable to the controversy and that the Ins. Commission and courts thus erred in rendering judgment as to the statutes' constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment holding that issues related to disability insurance discrimination were moot was affirmed. The judgment as to constitutionality of statutes was vacated, and the cause was remanded with directions to vacate orders from the Ins. Commission and to remand the case to the Ins.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed actions for judicial review of his reprimand, suspensions, and removal from his position as a correctional officer. His removal was based on multiple disciplinary infractions, including failure to report for duty and failure to report receipt of criminal summons. The employer's regulations provided for a system of progressive discipline. The trial court rejected the employee's double jeopardy argument and, ruling from the bench, upheld the disciplinary sanctions, including the removal. On its own motion, the court granted certiorari. The court reversed in part the trial court's judgment and remanded, directing the trial court to remand the action to the administrative agency. The court rejected the employee's administrative double jeopardy argument and held that principles of double jeopardy were not applicable because the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon the employee were remedial in nature, not punitive. However, the court found that the imposition of one of his suspension was not authorized by the regulation under which it was purportedly imposed. However, the other disciplinary action against him were undertaken in accordance with the regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment that affirmed the decision of the state's secretary of personnel, was it pertained to one of the suspensions imposed on the employee. As to that part of the judgment the court remanded, directing a remand to the administrative agency. Otherwise the court affirmed the disciplinary action against the employee, which were undertaken in accordance with the regulations.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgments of the circuit court, and remanded with directions to affirm the department's decision removing the correctional officers. The court held that the department's decision to file charges for removal against the correctional officers was not arbitrary and capricious because the correctional officers were not suspended and removed for the same incident. The suspension hearing concerned the correctional officers' failure to properly secure and search an inmate, as well as their failure to warn a superior officer that the inmate was potentially violent.

The lower court held the curfew ordinance, under which the juveniles were detained or arrested, was unconstitutionally vague but it affirmed that part of the order granting summary judgment which denied the juveniles' claims for damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two juveniles were detained or arrested pursuant to a city curfew ordinance under Frederick City Code &sect;&sect; 15-9(a), 15-10. The juveniles contended the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague under both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Maryland Declaration of Rights art. 24 , among other grounds, and requested damages as a result of intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence. The city and police officers claimed that the curfew ordinance was constitutional and that, even if it were invalid, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it did not contain sufficient criteria for the juveniles to determine if they were in violation. However, the court held that the lower court erred when it affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the juveniles were not entitled to damages. The court held that Maryland law ordinarily provided no immunity to public officials sued for violating state constitutional rights, and that the lower court erred in upholding the trial court's determination that the juveniles were not entitled to damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the lower court that held that the juveniles were not entitled to damages from the city and police officers after they enforced an unconstitutionally vague city ordinance by detaining or arresting the juveniles. The court ordered that the lower court remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Supp.), all Class B-D-7 licensees were required to add on-premises consumption facilities or to obtain a Class A-2 license restricting the hours during which liquor could be sold. The licensees challenged the constitutionality of Md. Code Ann. art. 2B, &sect; 18A(h) (1957, 1990 Repl. Vol., 1993 Cum.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of certiorari on its own motion to consider the following questions: (1) whether taxpayer's claims were barred by laches; (2) whether the county complied with the notice requirements of the Maryland Constitution, Md. Const. Art. XI-A, &sect; 3; and (3) whether voiding the ordinance would violate the contracts clause of the U.S. Constitution. Taxpayer asserted that laches does not apply when a plaintiff disputes the constitutionality of an ordinance. The court disagreed with taxpayer and noted that defects and irregularities in the mode of enactment of an ordinance do not pertain to the nature of the ordinance itself and such challenges may be precluded by laches. The court found the claim was clearly barred by laches. His claim was filed more than three years after the last possible date of accrual for the action and the claim was susceptible to the general three year statute of limitations. Moreover, the delay prejudiced the party asserting the defense. The court noted that appellee provided enough notice as was required by statute and did not address the federal constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

Nat. Res. Code Ann. 7-6A-10.1 and 7-6A-10.2 (1973, 1989, 1994) (the Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mining industry contended that the Act, which related to the appropriation of water in connection with certain surface mining operations violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 24, because there was no rational basis for its enactment. The court disagreed, and found as did the trial court that the question was not whether the General Assembly was correct; it was whether it was entitled to reach the conclusions embodied in the Act. The Act established a compensation scheme for affected landowners that bore a rational relationship to a problem that the General Assembly identified for redress. The Act was not beyond the authority of the General Assembly. Thus the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the state with respect to the mining industry's substantive due process argument. The mining industry further argued that quarries had been unfairly singled out from other large consumers of groundwater in a manner that violated equal protection principles. The court found this argument without merit and concluded that the statute was not constitutionally deficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner of the Division of Labor and Industry (commissioner) promulgated a rule prohibiting smoking in an enclosed workplace. Plaintiffs, businesses, trade associations, and tobacco companies (challengers), sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The Circuit Court for Talbot County (Maryland) issued an interlocutory injunction temporarily enjoining the enforcement of Md. Regs. Code tit. 09, &sect; 12.23. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner, acting in a quasi-legislative mode, adopted a regulation which was within the boundaries of its rule-making authority. It was not the function of the court to pass upon the wisdom of the regulation, or to approve or disapprove it, because it did not exceed constitutional limits. The court held that (1) the challengers had little likelihood of prevailing on the merits, (2) the commissioner did not exceed his statutory authority in promulgating the regulation, (3) there was abundant scientific evidence in the record to justify the commissioner's conclusion that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) was a &quot;significant risk&quot; to the health of Maryland employees, and this &quot;significant risk&quot; needed to be regulated by a complete prohibition against smoking in all enclosed workplaces, (4) the commissioner's findings that the economic impact of the regulation on the hospitality industry was minimal were legally sufficient, (5) implied preemption did not occur, (5) the Products Clause did not apply because the federal government had not adopted a specific standard with respect to the health effects of ETS in enclosed workplaces.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The granting of an interlocutory injunction was an improper exercise of judicial discretion. Accordingly, the interlocutory injunction was vacated and the matter was remanded for trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court, in reversing a portion of the judgment by the trial court, stated that &sect; 9-605 implicitly placed a clear and affirmative obligation on the marinas to charge and collect the appropriate user tax coincident with the time when the rental fees were collected. On appeal the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court because the tax imposed by City of Havre de Grace, Md. Ordinance 765 was applicable, by its plain language, to both the wet and dry storage of boats and did not exceed the authority granted by the general assembly. Md. Ann. Code art. 24, &sect; 9-605 (Repl. 1994), when construed by utilizing the canons of statutory construction, was not void for vagueness and required that the marinas only incurred liability for the tax when the rental fees were collected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a licensed consumer loan company, filed exceptions under Md. Rule 1228(j)(2) to a determination by defendants, trustees of the Clients' Security Trust Fund of the Bar of Maryland (fund), denying the loan company's claim for loans to personal injury plaintiffs (borrowers) secured by assignments of proceeds of successful claims that were never paid by the borrowers' attorneys (attorneys) to the loan company on the recoveries received.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The loan company had obtained judgments against the attorneys and sought collection against the borrowers before it sought reimbursement from the fund for the loans where tort cases were settled and the amount to be paid to the loan company was not remitted by the attorneys. The fund was a court-administered trust under Md. R. 1228 financed by assessments on Maryland lawyers, operated under court rules authorized by Md. Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. &sect;&sect; 10-310 - 10-312 (1989). The court found the loss payable by the fund because the attorneys had acted as fiduciaries for the loan company within the meaning of Md. Code Ann. &sect; 10-312(b)(1) and Md. Rule 1228(b)(3) and in accordance with their ethical obligations under Md. Lawyers' R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(b). It was consistent with the purposes of the fund - to maintain the integrity of the legal profession by paying money to reimburse losses caused by defalcations of lawyers - to recognize that the attorneys' fiduciary ethical obligation to a non-client under Rule 1.15(b) was a fiduciary obligation under the Maryland statutes and rules, making the defalcations payable by the fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the final determination of the fund denying the claim of the loan company, and the case was remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged of committing sexual child abuse, second degree rape, second and third degree sexual offense, and unnatural and perverted sexual practices on his adopted stepdaughter. Defendant sought to obtain pre-trial discovery review of the victim's psychotherapy records maintained by the victim's private psychotherapist. The trial court denied his request and the court of special appeals affirmed that decision, following defendant's conviction. On appeal, defendant contended that he had a right to the records under Md. R. 4-264 and the Maryland and United States Constitution. The court affirmed the lower courts, holding that Rule 4-264 precluded pre-trial discovery of a victim's privileged psychotherapist-patient records. In addition, neither due process, compulsory process, nor the right to confront adverse witnesses established a pre-trial right of defendant to discovery review of his stepdaughter's privileged psychotherapy records. Finally, defendant failed to establish the requisite need to warrant a judge ordering disclosure of the privileged information at trial. Thus, both the denial of pre-trial discovery and the conviction were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), the state challenged a judgment that reversed defendant husband's conviction for drug conspiracy on the grounds that the minimization guidelines for an electronic wiretap allowed law enforcement agents to purposefully intercept privileged marital communications in violation of Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 9-105.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Maryland challenged a judgment that reversed defendant husband's drug-conspiracy convictions because the minimization guidelines for an electronic wiretap improperly authorized the interception of privileged marital communications. The state argued that the trial court properly admitted into evidence the contents of the intercepted conversations, including two conversations between the husband and his wife. The appeals court held that a judge could not authorize police to purposefully intercept privileged marital communications. While agreeing with the appeals court's decision to reverse the convictions, the appellate court disagreed with its rationale. The appellate court held that the rationale ran afoul of a basic principle of statutory construction by giving the marital communications privilege, codified in Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 9-105, greater effect than the words of the statute supported. Because the maximum sanction to be imposed was suppression of the conversations that were unreasonably intercepted, the appellate court remanded for a new trial in the event that other issues raised but not decided by the appeals court were without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the judgment reversing the convictions, the court held that the improper admission of defendant husband's two marital communications into evidence required only that the case be remanded for a new trial in which the illegally intercepted communications could not be used. The court remanded for such new trial in the event that other issues raised by defendant and not decided by the appeals court were found to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the waiver of a jury trial was the same as affirmatively agreeing to a court trial. The buyers contended that the seller waived his right to a nonjury trial because he failed to assert that right in the trial court. The court affirmed the decisions of the lower courts. The court held that Md. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(a), conferred a constitutional right on both parties in civil litigation to elect a nonjury trial, but that it did not confer a constitutional right to a nonjury trial on individual civil litigants. Section 8(a) required an agreement between the seller and the buyers. The seller's waiver of the constitutional right to a jury trial did not amount to an agreement among the parties to proceed without the aid of a jury. The waiver of a jury trial pursuant to Md. Ct.

At the revocation hearing, the release was revoked along with the inmate's accumulated diminution credits. In his petition for habeas corpus relief, the inmate contended that the parole commission lacked authority to rescind the diminution credits because to have done so violated the ex post facto prohibition of the U.S. and Maryland Constitutions. The trial court denied the petition, and the court held that as applied to the inmate, Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 4-612(e), which entitled the parole commissioner presiding at a revocation hearing to rescind all diminution credits, was not an invalid ex post facto law because it was no more onerous than its predecessor statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a friend attacked two minority women because of their race. Defendant battered one of the women and sprayed lighter fluid on her. The court held that the indictment contained no count based on harassment, but only conspiracy to commit and committing a racially motivated crime. The court held that there was no evidence that defendant engaged in any semblance of constitutionally protected speech or conduct directed at the victims which was considered by the jury in its determination of guilt. Defendant lacked standing to challenge the hate crimes statute facially on the basis that its harassment prong was vague and overbroad. The testimony of one of the women supported the evidence given by the other attacker and established that defendant's acts were racially motivated. A prior racial incident that was the catalyst for the attacks was properly admitted because its probative value outweighed its prejudicial impact. The sentences imposed for the crimes of assault with intent to maim, kidnapping, and committing a racially motivated crime were not grossly disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father on behalf of minor sought a declaratory judgment that Md. Regs. Code tit. 08, &sect; 18.02.05A was invalid and a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the regulation. Defendant department filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the regulation was valid. The lower court rejected plaintiff's arguments, holding that defendant had not acted in an unconstitutional manner or exceeded its statutory authority and dismissed the case. Plaintiff appealed and the court issued a writ of certiorari prior to argument in the appellate court. The court agreed with the lower court's conclusions concerning the validity of the regulation but vacated the judgment dismissing the case. The court held that the lower court's rejection of plaintiff's position on the merits furnished no ground for dismissal. The court held that where a lower court erroneously dismissed a declaratory judgment action, the dismissal must be vacated and an appropriate declaratory judgment entered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought certiorari review of a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), reversing a trial court judgment that granted defendant's &quot;supplemental&quot; motion for revision of sentence, filed seven months after sentence was imposed. The trial court had ordered that execution of the unserved portion of the sentence be suspended and that defendant be placed on supervised probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to drug charges and was sentenced to imprisonment for three years. Her timely motion for revision of sentence was denied, but the court granted defendant's &quot;supplemental&quot; motion for revision. Two days later, the State filed an answer to defendant's motion, arguing that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the motion. The State appealed to the intermediate appellate court, which held that the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction, that the State was entitled to appeal, and that the trial court's order modifying the sentence must be vacated. The court held that the lower court was clearly without authority to modify defendant's sentence when it did so. The applicable rule provided that, although an illegal sentence could be corrected at any time, the court could otherwise alter a sentence only within 90 days after its imposition. The court further noted that although the State did not have a statutory right to appeal, the appeal would lie pursuant to the common law principle that the State had a right to appeal an action that was outside the lower court's jurisdiction, a principle that had not been abolished by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for taking photographs of a 15-year-old engaged in sexual conduct. At trial, defendant claimed that he did not take the photographs or, in the alternative, did not know that the subject was a minor. It was not unconstitutional for Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 419A(c) (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol.) to operate as a strict liability crime. Knowledge of the minor's age was not an element of the offense and a reasonable mistake of age was not available as a defense. The strict liability child pornography statute did not have an impermissible chilling effect on the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment because the state's interest in protecting children outweighed the individual's right to produce nonobscene adult pornography.

Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the officer who obtained the warrant would not have known that her affidavit failed to establish probable cause and that she should not have applied for the warrant. Thus, the officer had no duty to second guess the judge. The court found the officer presented the information received and the extent of her confirmatory investigation to a circuit court judge and was not obliged to withhold applying for the warrant. The court found that a reasonably well-trained officer would not have known that a judge should conclude that her investigation failed to satisfy the statutory requirements for a warrant, and thus her good-faith reliance on the warrant was therefore justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Md. Ann. Code art. 24, &sect; 9-602 (1957) authorized the county to tax space rentals. The county enacted Anne Arundel County, Md., Code &sect; 7-405(b), known as the &quot;boat slip tax.&quot; The taxpayer, a yacht club, was assessed a tax deficiency for marina services charges under the boat slip tax and a penalty. The circuit court held that under the plain meaning of the ordinance, forklift and other marina services were not taxable. Pursuant to a writ of certiorari, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. Under strict construction of the statute, the court held that the county was authorized to levy a tax on space rentals, but not on other marina services, when the charge for the space rental was set forth separately from the charge for other marina services. The boat slip tax was not a general retail sales tax. The marina services were not inherently necessary to the wet slip, outside rack, or boatel rentals. The county's own regulations and guidelines, which seemed to exempt the use of the forklift and other marina services from the boat slip tax, were given deference as an administrative interpretation of the state enabling act and the county ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), on certiorari, which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court that convicted defendant of theft of goods.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's petition for a writ of certiorari was granted to consider whether defendant adequately preserved for appellate review his contention that the trial judge erroneously permitted the state to exercise more than four peremptory challenges. The intermediate appellate court held that the state was entitled to only four peremptory challenges in the consolidated trial of defendant and a codefendant but found that defendant's objection was not timely made; thus the peremptory challenge issue was not properly preserved for appellate review. Defendant disputed that conclusion, contending that his objection was timely and that, since the state exceeded the permitted number of peremptory challenges, his conviction should be reversed. The court held that the record sufficiently indicated that defense counsel's statement put the trial judge on notice of her complaint that the state just exceeded its allotted number of peremptory challenges. The court ruled that defendant was entitled to a retrial because the trial judge had opined that dismissal of the panel should be the remedy if the state had exercised two excess peremptory challenges, and the state had done so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of special appeals and remanded to that court with instructions to vacate the conviction and remand to the circuit court for a new trial. The mayor and the city were ordered equally ordered to pay costs in the court and in the court of special appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, Attorney General of Maryland, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) which denied an injunction against respondent and declared Maryland's &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 764 (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol. and 1993 Cum. Supp.) unconstitutional. The Attorney General contended that it was constitutional to require the respondent to submit any &quot;notoriety of crimes&quot; contract for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The respondent, indicted for sexual child abuse, appeared on television talk shows and announced that he had contracted to sell his life story. The Attorney General requested an injunction requiring the respondent to submit any contract to him for review under Maryland's &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 764 (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol. and 1993 Cum. Supp.). The trial court denied the request for injunctive relief and declared &sect; 764&nbsp;unconstitutional on First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, grounds, and the state appealed. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment and remanded with directions to dismiss the action as not authorized by &sect; 764. The court declined to reach the merits of the question of &sect; 764's constitutionality because it was unnecessary to do so. The court held that the suit was not authorized by &sect; 764 because the law only required persons entering into suspected &quot;notoriety of crimes&quot; contracts with a defendant to submit those contracts to the Attorney General for review, not the defendants themselves.</SPAN></P>

Appellants filed a counterclaim, alleging that appellee breached a duty to them by subjecting the trust to significant taxes. The circuit court dismissed the counterclaim and granted appellee's motion for summary judgment against the settlor's son and personal representative for part of the tax and interest. The court affirmed, rejecting appellants' contention that &sect; 7-308 vested exclusive jurisdiction over apportionment in the orphans' courts. It was held that concurrent jurisdiction existed between the circuit courts and the orphans' courts over tax apportionment claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner of a towing service filed an action against the county, seeking a declaratory judgment that a location requirement in the county code was unconstitutional. The owner sought a writ of mandamus ordering the county to assign him a tow area and to call him in the event that a tow operator was needed in his area. The location requirement mandated that a licensed tow operator have a place of business within the county before that operator could be called by police to tow vehicles that were disabled by accidents. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the county. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the location requirement was wholly unrelated to any legitimate government objective and that it violated the equal protection guarantees of the Maryland Constitution. Because the court could find no rational basis for the distinction between in-county and out-of-county towers, it was led to the probable view that the classification was intended to confer the monopoly of a profitable business upon residents of the town. The court held that the county was not free to make arbitrary distinctions based upon whether a licensee's premises were located within the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order awarding summary judgment to the county was reversed and the case was remanded for the entry of a judgment declaring the location requirement invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being promoted to a supervisory position, the correctional officer was prohibited from continuing to represent fellow employees in various grievance proceedings. The officer challenged the direct order under Md. Ann. Code of 1957 art. 64A, &sect; 53(b). An administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that &sect; 53(b), which provided that an employee with a grievance could be represented by any person or persons of his choice, held that the officer did not have standing to use that section. The trial court reversed, finding that &sect; 53(b) placed no limitations on &quot;management representation.&quot; The appellate court reversed, holding that the officer lacked standing because he was not an aggrieved party. The court granted certiorari and reversed, holding that the officer was an aggrieved party within the meaning of &sect; 52 and &sect; 53(b), and therefore possessed standing to challenge the ALJ's decision. Because the per se restriction was an unreasonable interpretation of the statute's objectives, the ALJ's decision concerning this issue was arbitrary and capricious. As no evidence of an actual conflict of interest was presented, the court would not deem one to exist as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The court further ruled that because the lienors had never established a lien prior to the creation of the owners' equitable title, the owners' equitable title was insulated from any lien of judgment even if the owners had been aware of the lienors' claims when they agreed to purchase the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an inmate in the segregation unit. Defendant had previously been convicted for assaulting a guard with a wire instrument. When a guard was walking past his cell, a liquid, presumed to be water, was squirted on the guard. The guard claimed that defendant admitted that he had squirted the water. Defendant denied the incident. Defendant was convicted of assault, and was sentenced to 20 years, consecutive to his existing sentence. Defendant appealed, and argued that the sentence was disproportionate, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. Defendant sought certiorari. The court granted certiorari, affirmed the conviction, reversed the sentence, and remanded. The court held that perfect proportionality among sentences was not required, but that gross disproportionality was prohibited. The court held that in reviewing proportionality, it looked at the specific facts of the crime charged, not the elements of the offense. The court held that throwing a small amount of water on someone was at the low end of the spectrum of assaultive behavior. The court held that the sentence was grossly disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a 20-year old young retarded male who previously met the victim, who was 13 years old, and talked with her occasionally by telephone. He approached the victim's house, and she opened her bedroom window and directed him to use a ladder to climb up the window. The two talked, engaged in sexual intercourse, and remained in the bedroom for more than seven hours before defendant departed therefrom. Defendant alleged that the victim previously represented that she was 16 years old and that he had acted with such belief, and there was no mens rea and reasonable mistake of fact; the state alleged that Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 463(a)(3) was a strict liability offense. The court held (1) the second degree rape statute,&nbsp;&sect; 463(a)(3), was a strict liability offense that did not require the state to prove mens rea; (2) as such, defendant was guilty of the second degree rape by engaging in sexual intercourse with the victim, who was under fourteen years of age and four years his junior; and (3) the mistake-of-age defense was not allowable under &sect; 463(a)(3), which made no reference to defendant's knowledge, belief, or other state of mind.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of his rape conviction, defendant sought to prove that the victim's allegations of rape were a vindictive response to not receiving drugs in return for sexual relations. The prosecution argued that evidence of the victim's past sexual activities was prejudicial and barred under the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 461(a) (1957). The court rejected the prosecution's argument, holding that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice. The court found that the evidence related to a direct matter that would not obscure the issues and confuse the jury. The court reasoned that there was a close connection between the sexual conduct evidence and defendant's defense. Defendant sought to show the victim's motive for accusing him of rape. Further, the court found that there was little danger that the evidence would be misused by the jury. Finally, the court found that the evidence was necessary to defendant's defense. The court reasoned that the central focus of the case was the very issue to which the contested evidence related.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Garrett County (Maryland) found that defendant waived his rights to an automatic stay under Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 645A(a) (1957) and review of his sentence.

The court determined that defendant was competent to waive further proceedings. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. It held that the trial court's finding that defendant was competent to make decisions concerning the discharge of his attorneys and the pursuit of additional legal proceedings was amply supported by the evidence. Defendant could not waive the 240-day stay of execution under &sect; 645A(a) because the legislature intended the stay to be mandatory. If defendant did not desire to file a petition for post-conviction relief, the trial judge could issue a death warrant for a time beyond the period of the stay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's operator's license was suspended by the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) for 120 days after the driver refused to take a breathalyzer test when she was stopped for allegedly driving while intoxicated.

The driver appealed that decision, alleging that the officer induced her to refuse the test and that the administrative law judge improperly refused her request to subpoena the detaining officer. The court reversed the decision of the MVA and determined that an officer's negation of previously and properly given advice of right could have violated the licensee's due process rights. The court also stated that without findings of fact on all material issues and without a clear statement of the rationale behind the administrative law judge's action, a reviewing court was unable to properly perform its function.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, among other things, that the trial judge erred in refusing to strike the state's motion of intent to seek the death penalty and in refusing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal made during the sentencing proceeding. The court affirmed. The court found that what defendant sought by his motions to strike the state's notice of intention to seek a sentence of death was the entry of summary judgment on the issue of mental retardation and, because summary judgment did not exist in criminal procedure, the motions were properly denied. The court also found that a defendant who was given a life sentence because he was not eligible for the imposition of the death penalty faced a limitation of 15 years before consideration for parole. The court concluded, however, that although its interpretation of the applicable statute benefited defendant by determining the computation that had to be made with respect to his life sentence when his eligibility for parole consideration was calculated, it did not affect the judgments entered below.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed orders from the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which granted defendants' motion to dismiss the indictments against them for burning crosses without obtaining permission from the property owners and the local fire department, in violation of Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 10A (1957, 1992 Repl.), as violative of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the burning of a cross denoted conduct as opposed to speech, but that the act was sufficiently expressive to qualify for First Amendment protection. On appeal of the dismissal of defendants' indictments, the court affirmed that case law established that the act was speech within the contemplation of the First Amendment. The court affirmed that Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 10A was a content-based regulation of speech and subject to strict scrutiny. The court rejected the state's assertion that the statutory purpose was to protect property owners from unwanted fires and to safeguard the community because other criminal statutes adequately provided for those legitimate state interests. The court noted that the legislative history of the cross-burning law revealed that the purpose of the statute was to express disagreement with the act's inherent expression. The court affirmed that the law fell within no doctrinal exceptions that exempted it from the First Amendment. The court held that Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 10A was not necessary for the state's effort to foster racial and religious accord, and therefore did not survive strict scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the cross-burning law was constitutionally invalid, and affirmed the dismissal of the indictments against defendants.</SPAN></P>

A special master appointed by the court found no merit in any of the citizens' contentions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with his constitutional duty under the Md. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 2-5, the governor of Maryland, upon receiving the results of the 1990 census, undertook to develop a redistricting plan for the Maryland General Assembly. He appointed a five-member advisory committee to assist him. The committee submitted a plan and acknowledged that the following criteria constrained its decisions: equality of population between districts, minority representation, compactness, contiguity, and respect for natural boundaries and the boundaries of political subdivisions. The court held that public notices for hearings as to the redistricting plan were sufficient and that the governor did not have a statutory or constitutional obligation to be present at the final hearing of the redistricting process. The court further held that the redistricting plan adequately described the districts created and that one district in particular satisfied the constitutional compactness requirement. Additionally, the court held that the plan fell within the 10 percent flexibility rule of the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; requirement and that the plan did not violate the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that his prior conviction relied on by the State in order to enhance his sentence was constitutionally infirm because the State failed to show that he intelligently waived his right to trial by jury. The record disclosed that defendant was represented by counsel at the time of the prior conviction. The State contended that defendant was not entitled to collaterally attack the validity of the prior conviction during the sentencing proceeding because he was previously represented by counsel, and if defendant was allowed to raise the issue during the sentencing proceeding, the burden of proof was upon defendant to demonstrate the constitutional deficiency claimed. The court held that collateral challenges to the constitutional validity of a facially valid predicate conviction could not be raised at a sentencing hearing. The fact that defendant was properly represented by counsel during the prior conviction raised a strong presumption of regularity and satisfied the facial validity of the prior conviction. The State met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt by providing a properly authenticated record of the prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought certiorari, asserting that Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 142(c) (1957 &amp; Repl. Vol. 1992) violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The court granted certiorari before the intermediate appellate court heard the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant paid for a television at a department store with a check. When the department store presented the check to the bank for payment, the bank dishonored it because defendant's account was closed. Defendant was charged with obtaining property or services by bad check. At trial, the State introduced a bank affidavit, showing that defendant did not have an account with the bank when he wrote the check. Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court granted certiorari before the intermediate appellate court heard the case. The court affirmed, holding that out-of-court statements admitted under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 142(c) (1957 &amp; Repl. Vol. 1992) had sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. The court reasoned that the hearsay exception under &sect; 142(c) was derived from the business records hearsay exception and found that the Confrontation Clause did not require the State to prove that the declarant of the affidavit was unavailable. The court also concluded that the typographical error in the affidavit did not undermine its reliability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Writ of certiorari was granted with respect to plaintiff indigent citizens' appeal of a judgment from the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland), which was to address the granting of defendant state's motion for summary judgment regarding the indigent citizens' challenge to the validity of the governor's reducing appropriations pursuant to Md. Code Ann., State Fin. &amp; Proc. &sect; 7-213 (1988).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the indigent citizens argued that &sect; 7-213 was inconsistent with Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 52, and thus was unauthorized. The court, however, found that &sect; 52 allowed the governor to revise departmental estimates and, in the event that departmental exceeded estimated revenues, Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 52(5a) mandated that the governor reduce those departmental estimates. In addition, Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 52 expressly provided that the governor was permitted to amend or supplement the budget bill. Furthermore, delegation of legislative power to the executive branch was constitutionally permissible, and did not constitute a violation of Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 8, because sufficient safeguards were legislatively provided for the guidance in administration of the statute. The court accordingly affirmed, concluding that the 25 percent limitation in Md. Code Ann., State Fin. &amp; Proc. &sect; 7-213 on the reduction of any appropriation was not violated when the governor eliminated the Medical Assistance State Only grant.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) declared that the ballot language was misleading and directed the secretary to certify new ballot language.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An enactment of the Maryland General Assembly, signed by the governor, addressed the subject of abortion and revised statutory provisions relating to abortion.

Plaintiffs challenged the ballot language prepared by the secretary of state, alleging that the language miscast and misrepresented the true nature and purpose of the referred law and used vague, ambiguous, and obtuse generalizations. The circuit court declared that the ballot language was misleading. The court reversed the declaratory judgment and injunctive orders of the circuit court and directed that a new declaratory judgment upholding the validity of the ballot title be entered. The court ruled that the standards to be applied were clearly set forth in the constitution and statutes. The secretary presented the purpose of the measure concisely and intelligently in accordance with those standards. The court emphasized that judicial review of the ballot title was not concerned with the question of whether better ballot language could be drafted, but whether language met the required standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether CB-152-1989, the &quot;mini-dorm&quot; ordinance, deprived the students of equal protection of the law by discriminating against a class of persons in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The court held that: (1) to withstand equal protection scrutiny, the ordinance should have been rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose; (2) the ordinance's differentiation between permissible residential tenant classes by creating more strenuous zoning requirements for some and less for others based solely on the occupation that the tenant pursued away from the residence was an arbitrary classification that was forbidden under Article 24; and (3) the zoning classification of residential property was wholly unrelated to the stated purpose of the ordinance, and its impact upon persons who were registered as full-time or part-time students at an institution of higher learning denied those students equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which reversed an administrative judgment in favor of appellants, Maryland Department of General Services and Maryland State Police, dismissing appellee contractor's appeal as time barred, and remanded for a hearing on the merits, in a claim for money owed under a contract to replace concrete sidewalks at the state police headquarters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor appealed to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (MSBCA) alleging appellants owed it additional money. The MSBCA granted appellants' motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely. The trial court reversed the judgment, ruling that Md. Regs. Code tit. 21, &sect; 10.04.06B was overbroad and violated the separation of powers doctrine, and finding that the contractor's request for an equitable adjustment was never denied. The court granted certiorari. On review, the court reversed the trial court. The court held that the state legislature expressly authorized appeals by contractors to the MSBCA when a state agency failed to reach a decision on a claim within 180 days of the claim. Md. Code Ann. State. Fin. &amp; Proc. &sect; 15-220 required a contractor to appeal to the MSBCA within 30 days of the statutory expiration period. The challenged regulations did not violate the separation of powers doctrine as they only mirrored the statute. The trial court exceeded its scope of review by finding that the request for equitable adjustment remained under active consideration. Finally, the MSBCA's findings were supported by substantial evidence and were not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded to the trial court with instructions to affirm the order of the administrative agency. The court held that the action was time-barred, applicable regulations did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because they merely mirrored statutory provisions and that the agency's factual findings were supported by substantial evidence, and were not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court. The court held that pursuant to Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 46, which mandated that gender was a suspect classification subject to strict scrutiny, and Md. Const. Decl. Rts. art. 24, which guaranteed equal protection, the state was prevented from using peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors based on their gender. Moreover, because the record made clear that the state excluded jurors based on gender, the court reversed the cause without giving the state the opportunity to explain its peremptory challenges.

The ALJ of the OAH conducted extensive hearings in which the transcript contained 551 pages. The ALJ proposed that the state employee be reinstated. The DOP designee renounced the proposed decision of the ALJ and ordered that the state employee be separated from state service. The order was affirmed by the circuit court. On appeal, the court held that: (1) credibility of the witnesses was of the utmost importance; (2) the DOP designee did not give proper deference to the ALJ's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses; (3) there was not substantial evidence to support the order of the DOP; and (4) the DOP designee must reconsider her order in the light of the interrelation between the function of the DOP designee and the AJL.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was granted parole by respondent Institution Board of Review (board) and was simultaneously served with a notice of a hearing to determine whether probable cause existed to believe he had violated parole. At the hearing the defendant was ordered held pending a formal parole revocation hearing. The trial court affirmed and the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) reversed and ordered the defendant released. The board sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was incarcerated after he was convicted of murder, attempted murder, and assault and battery. Md. Ann. Code art. 31B, &sect;11(b)(2) (1957, 1983 Repl. Vol.), then in effect, required that the governor approve parole for an inmate serving a life sentence. The governor rejected the recommendation. Section 11(b)(2) was held not to be applied retroactively and a circuit court granted the defendant's petition for habeas corpus relief. The board did not appeal. The board issued respondent an order of parole and simultaneously served the defendant with notice of a preliminary hearing to determine whether the defendant had violated the conditions of his parole by not participating in treatment and counseling sessions. The defendant was ordered held pending a formal hearing. The trial court affirmed the board's order, but the special court of appeals ordered that the defendant be released. On appeal, the court held that (1) the defendant's parole could not be revoked for conditions of parole he was not aware of until the time of parole, and (2) the board could rescind the defendant's parole for misconduct after parole and before physical release.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that defendant's arrest was illegal because the officer did not ask defendant to leave the area prior to arresting him, as required under art. 19, &sect; 58C(d).

The court found that the hours that children frequented the areas surrounding school grounds were not limited to those in which the school was open for classroom instruction. School grounds served as a location for a variety of school-sponsored extracurricular activities as well as community-sponsored sports and social activities involving children which may take place during evening and weekend hours.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his conviction and sentence under Maryland's Drug Kingpin Act (Kingpin Act), Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 286 (1992 Repl. Vol.), as well as for various conspiracy counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of an undercover narcotics investigation targeting defendant's brother, defendant was indicted and convicted under the Kingpin Act for his involvement in a conspiracy to distribute 448 grams of cocaine. Defendant challenged his conviction alleging that &sect; 286 was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his kingpin conviction. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, and the court reversed as to the kingpin conviction. The court concluded that the Kingpin Act was not unconstitutionally vague where the statute was not a trap for the unwary and where the meaning of the statute was fairly ascertainable. The court further found that the statute was not vague as applied to the facts of the present case. However, the court held that the trial court erred in submitting the kingpin count to the jury because of insufficient evidence. It was clear that &sect; 286 was intended to apply to a leader of a drug trafficking network and not to the defendant whose role was basically as a courier of the drugs. The court found that the evidence supported the fact that defendant's brother was the sole kingpin in the criminal episode.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions but vacated the death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding. The new jury again sentenced defendant to death, and the court affirmed. The court found that the trial judge was not required make an on-the-record determination that defendant was knowingly and voluntarily proceeding with a jury sentencing. The trial judge acted properly in denying defendant's request to trifurcate his sentencing proceeding, because the principalship and other sentencing-related issues were to be resolved in a unitary sentencing proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant disclosed an intention to present expert psychiatric testimony as to the absence of specific intent to kill, plaintiff state sought and was granted a mental examination. However, no psychiatric testimony was ultimately admitted at trial. Defendant was convicted in the Court of Special Appeals, Circuit Court for Howard County (Maryland), on charges including first degree premeditated murder and thereafter sought certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, while requiring defendant to be examined by the state's mental health professionals, forbade the disclosure of results to the state until after the trial began and limited the state's use thereof to rebuttal of any defense psychiatric testimony. Because defendant's psychiatric testimony was then excluded, the state never offered any psychiatric testimony. After conviction, defendant claimed error in the rulings allowing the examination and excluding his expert testimony. The court affirmed. It found that Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-263(d)(1) authorized the lower court to force defendant to submit to examination, that no constitutional violation occurred, and that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the examination and limiting access to and use of the results. The court also found no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of defendant's psychiatric testimony. The court held that the evidence was inadmissible to show defendant's actual intent at the time of the offense because it was incompetent. It also was inadmissible as a &quot;psychological profile&quot; because it lacked an adequate factual basis and bore no relevance to issues of premeditation or intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) and the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) held that ballot initiatives to place proposed &quot;property tax limitation&quot; charter amendments on the ballot in both counties, and a &quot;ballot initiative amendment&quot; on the ballot in Anne Arundel county, were unconstitutional in violation of Md. Const. art. XI-A, &sect; 5. Appellants, voters in both counties, appealed from the rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that because the voters of a charter county could not reserve to themselves the power to initiate legislation, since such initiative conflicted with the terms of Md. Const. art. XI-A, &sect; 3, the proposed &quot;ballot initiative&quot; amendment was unconstitutional. However, the court found that the proposed &quot;property tax limitation&quot; charter amendments were facially valid and did not conflict with public general law. Those amendments would not have divested the county councils of the ability to set the property tax rates, but merely would have prohibited collection above a specified cap. The court found that the &quot;roll back&quot; provision and &quot;escape clause&quot; provisions of the amendments, although invalid, were severable from the valid portions of the &quot;property tax limitation&quot; amendments. Thus, the &quot;property tax limitation&quot; proposed amendments, following the severance of the invalid provisions, was properly submitted to the voters of Baltimore and Ann Arundel counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that portion of the judgment prohibiting the placement of the proposed &quot;ballot initiative amendment&quot; on the ballot.

The court affirmed. The court found that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The trial judge did not have discretion to bifurcate the sentencing proceeding in order to separate out the principalship issue under Md. R. Crim. Causes 4-343. Unanimously, and beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury found defendant was a principal in the first degree to the murder. Unanimously, and by a preponderance of the evidence, the jury found that the seven statutorily recognized mitigating factors did not exist and that there were no other mitigating factors. The death sentence as applied under Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 413 was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county provided for a real property tax rate in excess of $ 2.40 per $ 100 of assessed value, a limitation imposed in 1984 upon the amount of real property taxes collected. In a declaratory judgment and injunction action against the county, the taxpayer contended that the real property tax rate limitation restricted the county's authority to exceed the limitation in order to service the debt incurred on its general obligation bonds issued prior to the enactment of the limitation. The circuit court held that the county had the authority to levy the tax. The court granted a petition for certiorari and affirmed the circuit court's decision. The court held that: (1) where the 1984 limitation did not clearly manifest a retroactive intention, to afford retroactive effect would interfere with substantive rights and thus the county's levy in excess of $ 2.40 in order to service pre-limitation debt was appropriate; and (2) where the trial court carefully considered all of the circumstances of a second taxpayer's motion to intervene bearing in mind that the suit was a collusive one, the court found no reason to disturb the circuit court's exercise of discretion in denying the motion.</SPAN></P>

The supervisor had submitted tax bills to an address of a vacate lot, and the church did not receive any notices of property taxes that were due. The county sold the property at a tax sale to respondent purchaser. The church alleged that the purchaser had failed to comply with the requirements of the statute governing tax sales and had failed to make a reasonable investigation to obtain the church's address. Accordingly, the church claimed that it had been deprived of its property without due process of law. The purchaser responded that he had followed the explicit requirements of the statute, which required no investigation beyond a search of the land records and the tax rolls. The court held that the failure to mail a copy of the order of publication to the church at the correct address resulted in the court not acquiring jurisdiction, and necessitated vacating the order foreclosing the right of redemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of special appeals, and remanded the case to that court with instructions to reverse the judgment of the circuit court, and to remand the case to that court for entry of an order granting the church's motion to vacate the order foreclosing the right of redemption.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 562A(a) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged in her wrongful termination action that her employer fired her for refusing to give time and money to a certain fund-raising organization. She further alleged that the policy violated public policy, as set forth in &sect; 562A. The trial court certified the question as to whether the organization was included as a social or economic association within the meaning of &sect; 562A, and the court held that the statute did not include charitable organizations. The court looked to the rules of statutory construction, determining that a penal statute was to be strictly construed. The court found that the non-profit fund-raising entity was not a social organization within the meaning of the statute because its predominant purpose was not social activities. Further, because the legislature gave a specific definition to a charitable organization, under Md. Ann. Code art. 41, &sect; 3-201(b)(1) (1990), it intended such an organization to be different than a social or economic organization. The court found it totally unpersuasive that the legislature intended to include all fund-raising charitable organizations in its proscription under &sect; 562A.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee guard instituted appeals contending that appellant department infringed upon his First Amendment rights to free speech in terminating his employment. The guard sought a review of the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which affirmed the finding of the department's secretary of personnel that the employee's behavior did not promote the efficiency of the public services that the correctional institution performed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guard allegedly made racially derogatory comments at a bank teller out of anger. The guard was employed on a probationary basis at a correctional institution. The warden terminated his employment upon learning of the situation. After several levels of the guard's appeals, the secretary of personnel found the behavior to have been adverse to the job of correctional officer and a cause of difficulty to the efficiency of the public services performed. The court noted that when a public employee spoke upon matters of public concern not as a citizen but as an employee on matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, such speech would not be given too high a priority in its protection under the First Amendment. The court found the guard's speech to be personal in nature. The guard's overreaction at the bank and resort to ethnic epithets in a peaceful surrounding, triggered by a relatively minor irritant, gave foundation to the department's concern that the guard would resort to similar behavior if frustrated under the considerable pressures of attempting to maintain order at the corrections institution. The court, thus, affirmed the circuit court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the circuit court and ordered that costs would be paid by the guard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party filed a lawsuit against defendant company as the result of the injuries the injured party received from a car accident with the company's employee. The jury found in favor of the injured party and awarded substantial damages in excess of the statutory cap provided by Md. Code. Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-108 regarding non-economic damages. The trial court found that &sect; 11-108 violated the equal protection guarantee in Md. Const. Decl. Rights art. 24. The court of special appeals reversed and held that the statute was constitutional. On review, the court found that the statute was subject to the rational basis test. The court found that the statutory limitation upon recoverable noneconomic tort damages under Md. Code. Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 11-108 did not amount to a restriction upon access to the courts. Instead, &sect; 11-108 modified the law of damages to be applied in tort cases. Furthermore, &sect; 11-108 was enacted in response to a legislatively perceived crisis concerning the availability and cost of liability insurance. Therefore, the cap was reasonably related to a legitime legislative objective. The judgment of the court of special appeals was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court decision that reversed the trial court was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Maryland), which valued the condemned property as of the date of trial in the state's &quot;quick take&quot; condemnation action against respondent condemnee under Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect;&sect; 8-318 to 8-331 (1977, Cum. Supp. 1991). The condemnee cross-appealed the denial of prejudgment interest and filed a writ of certiorari petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state utilized the statutory &quot;quick-take&quot; procedures under &sect;&sect; 8-318 to 8-331 to freeze an early date of valuation and to permit an immediate taking of land. However, the state, inter alia, did not file its formal petition for condemnation within one year of its initial filing.

The court held, inter alia, that (1) the trial judge correctly applied a trial date valuation based on the clear language of Md. Code Ann., Transp. &sect; 8-330 (1977, Cum.

The motion was denied. The circuit court convicted petitioner of homicide, driving while intoxicated, and driving on a revoked license. On appeal, the court held that because the collateral order doctrine did not apply to de novo appeals from the district court, petitioner's appeal was not before the circuit court. Consequently, there was no legal effect to the circuit court's denial of petitioner's motion to dismiss or the circuit court's judgment of conviction. The court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings on all pending charges.

Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 412(b) (1987 Repl. Vol.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the premeditated murder of an elderly woman. Defendant maintained that he was entitled to a new trial as to his guilt of these offenses because the evidence was insufficient to establish that he was the perpetrator of the crimes and because the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. Defendant also urged, for 12 reasons, that the imposition of the death penalty was improper and a new sentencing hearing was therefore required. The court affirmed the convictions and sentence, except that it vacated the theft convictions as they were lesser included offenses in the robbery conviction. The court rejected defendant's assertion that because the convictions rested solely on circumstantial evidence, they could not be sustained unless they were inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence. Rather, the standard applied was whether the record reasonably supported a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that defendant could have been sentenced to death because the record revealed that he was present near the victim's apartment and could have, by his own hand, perpetrated the crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former deputy sheriff challenged her termination by respondent sheriff, claiming violations of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and of United States Constitution. The trial court dismissed the claims. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of all federal claims and of the state constitutional claims in respect to &quot;individual capacity&quot; claims, but reversed as to &quot;official capacity&quot; claims. Both parties sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Deputy sheriff's federal claims were brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The sheriff was acting as a state official, and so the sheriff was not a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 1983 with regard to official capacity claims for damages. Therefore, those claims were properly dismissed. However, the lower court erred in dismissing the individual capacity &sect; 1983 claims because the gist of the sheriff's allegedly wrongful conduct was discharging the deputy sheriff because of her sex. While the sheriff clearly acted within the scope of her government employment when she discharged the deputy sheriff, she was not acting pursuant to a policy or custom of the state or county sheriff's office. As to the state constitutional claims, the appellate court erred in splitting the claims into official capacity and individual capacity claims, because state law, contrary to, federal law, does not allow this bifurcation. The dismissal of the state constitutional claims should have been reversed because state officials, unlike the state itself, are not entitled to immunity from compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded with directions to affirm the trial court's judgment in part and reverse that judgment in part, and to remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The comptroller contended that under its administrative regulations that the shopper guides were not newspapers for the purposes of the statutory exemption. The trial court rendered judgment for the comptroller, and the taxpayer sought review. The court affirmed. It found that the sales tax regulation did not improperly limit the scope of the statutory exemption from sales tax for the printing and sale of newspapers of any and all types. Furthermore, the regulation was not arbitrary and capricious. The court also found that the comptroller's refusal to grant the exemption to the taxpayer did not violate the petitioner's right to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the restriction was not more extensive than necessary to serve the governmental interest directly advanced by the restriction.</SPAN></P>

The employees contended that the state was required to pay comparable salaries to persons in positions involving comparable duties, experience, responsibilities and authority. On appeal, the court agreed with the intermediate appellate court that there was a rational basis for the classification drawn by the state between psychiatric nurses and clinical social workers. The positions of clinical social workers and psychiatric nurses involved different professions with different qualifications and the nurses had the capability to perform functions that the social workers could not perform. Therefore, the classification did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions and sentences. On appeal, the issue was whether the trial court's ruling that defendant's prior statement was voluntary was preserved for appeal where defendant failed to testify on his own behalf and proffered to the court that, but for its ruling, he would have exercised his right to testify. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court stated that defendant's alleged injury was remote and speculative. Assuming defendant was correct, it was not clear how his constitutional rights were violated. His right against self-incrimination was not infringed upon, as he elected not to testify. In order to raise and preserve for review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction, defendant was required to have testified at trial and been impeached. Additionally, the court found that the imposition of one sentence for conspiracy to commit murder and one sentence for conspiracy to commit robbery was plain error, and an illegal sentence resulted. The court noted that only one sentence could have been imposed for a single common law conspiracy no matter how many criminal acts the conspirators had agreed to commit.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected each of defendant's many assertions of error in his resentencing trial. It was not error to refuse to inform the jury as to defendant's handgun sentence so the jury could consider whether that sentence in addition to a sentence of life imprisonment would be sufficient, as the jury could only have guessed as to the actual impact of that sentence and its effect on defendant's parole eligibility. It was within the trial court's discretion to refuse to allow defendant to reopen his case in order to present evidence on the handgun sentence, and defendant was not prejudiced thereby. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering defendant shackled upon the indication that defendant was an escape risk. It was not error to refuse to excuse jurors with a stated predisposition to assess the death penalty when they affirmed that they could conscientiously apply the law and find the facts. It was not error to admit testimony and physical evidence reflecting defendant's conduct in prison, his intentions to escape from prison, or expert opinion testimony as to defendant's dangerousness.</SPAN></P>

The state argued that the applicability of &sect; 554 must be determined from a constitutional basis, and that if private conduct was excepted, the statute would have expressly excluded it. The court construed the statute narrowly and held that the prohibitions of &sect; 554 did not encompass consensual, noncommercial, heterosexual activity between adults in the privacy of the home. The court construed &sect; 554 so as to avoid a serious constitutional question. The court stated that in order to avoid serious constitutional issues, it had repeatedly given a narrow construction to statutes containing broad general language, such as &sect; 554. The statute's silence concerning the matters of consent, privacy, and marriage created legitimate questions regarding its reach. The court observed that the cases that upheld convictions under &sect; 554 involved homosexual activity, minors, or public places, but not private, consensual acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court determined that certain provisions for the property tax limitation amendment were invalid and severable, and that the property tax limitation amendment was otherwise, facially, not in conflict either with public general law or with Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, estate of deceased infant and infant's parents, sought review of the appeals court reversal of a medical malpractice award against respondent county. The court first held that the county's governmental immunity waiver was not abolished by a 1986 amendment to Prince George's County, Md., County Charter &sect; 1013. Because the ballot for the provision failed to meet the &quot;understandable language&quot; requirement of Md. Ann. Code art. 33, &sect; 16-6(a), the amendment was rendered invalid. The court then applied the earlier version of &sect; 1013 which served to waive governmental immunity but limited it to $ 250,000 per occurrence. The matter was remanded to determine whether the county had liability insurance that would cover the damage award, as well as the method of apportionment. The court also ruled that petitioners, who accepted a remittitur but had not received payment of the reduced judgment or filed order of satisfaction, were not barred from cross-appealing the judgment. Finally, the court directed that another judge decide the motion for recusal, because the claim was based on the trial court judge's personal misconduct, the alleged sexual harassment of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of respondent county and remanded to the circuit court with directions to vacate the decision and remand to the trial court for a determination of the availability of insurance coverage for respondent's liability and the apportionment of any insurance proceeds. The court also directed the assignment of another judge to evaluate the recusal motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, county board of education, filed a complaint against defendants, mayor and town council, on alternate theories of negligence, strict liability, and nuisance. The board asserted that the municipality was liable for damages caused by a leak of gasoline from the underground tank of its maintenance facility. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) granted the council's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board asserted that the town was liable for damages caused by a gasoline leak from the underground tank of its maintenance facility into the sump pump of a public elementary school owned by the board. It also alleged that the leaking gasoline caused flammable vapors in the school and that the school was closed by order of the fire department as a result. The trial court found that the town was immune from suit under the doctrine of governmental immunity. The board argued that general immunity principles were irrelevant because all governmental immunity in the area of water pollution had been abrogated by statute. The board argued, alternatively, that the town did not enjoy immunity because its operation of the maintenance facility was a proprietary rather than a governmental function. Finally the board contended that governmental immunity did not protect the town from nuisance actions. The court found that the town was not protected by immunity because the tort suit was brought by the board as a state agency. A municipality could not assert the defense of sovereign immunity in an action based on negligent performance of a governmental function brought by the state itself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment granting the motion to dismiss the board's complaint and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Proc. &sect; 5-109 (1974, 1989 Repl. Vol.). On appeal, the court affirmed in part but vacated and remanded in part the lower court's order holding that the lower court had correctly determined that counts one through nine of plaintiffs' complaint were barred under &sect; 5-109. However, the court held that the remaining counts of the complaint were not barred under &sect; 5-109 because the complaint alleged that those acts of negligence occurred within five years of the date of plaintiffs' filing of the suit. The court further held that although the viable claims could have been litigated in an earlier proceeding between the parties, the claims were not barred by res judicata because no final adjudication of the barred claims had occurred in the prior proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The corporation filed suit alleging that the policy violated the Contracts Clause. The trial court held that the Contracts Clause was violated, but the appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The policy impaired the parties contract, but the corporation had the option between losing its allocation and retaining it by paying the minimum charge.

The governor vetoed the bill that would have allowed the stockholders' corporation to race in the state. After the stockholders sold their stock, the General Assembly overrode the veto. The stockholders alleged in their complaint that common law deceit was practiced upon them in the sale of their stock. They argued that the governor conspired with others in the General Assembly to reduce the price of the stock so that they could acquire it at a depressed price. The governor filed a motion for summary judgment based on his absolute immunity. The court reversed the lower court's denial of the governor's motion for summary judgment. The court held that the discretion exercised by the governor in deciding whether to veto or approve legislation did not differ from that to be exercised by legislators in deciding whether to vote for or against a bill. The court held that there was no policy reason why legislators should enjoy absolute immunity for their legislative acts but that the governor should have only a qualified immunity for his legislative function of vetoing or approving legislation.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P., Cir. Ct. 2-341 permitted amendments to pleadings. The taxpayers violated Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-405(c) when they failed to give notice to the Attorney General regarding their allegation of the ordinance's unconstitutionality. However, the lack of notice did not deprive the circuit court of jurisdiction over the subject matter because the circuit court declared the ordinance to be invalid on nonconstitutional grounds. Md. R Civ. P., Cir. Ct. 2-211 and 21-231 did not require the joinder of similarly situated taxpayers.

The day after the appeal hearing an acting assistant secretary of the department terminated the employee's employment. The employee appealed his termination arguing, among other things, the termination was improper because the action was taken by the acting assistant secretary and not the appointing authority as contemplated by Md.

The department, on appeal, questioned if it had the burden to prove an unclassified employee was properly terminated by his appointing authority. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the burden was on the employee to show his termination was illegal; (2) the employee showed that under pertinent statutes, the secretary of the department was the official having the authority to remove the employee; and (3) the department failed to show that the authority to terminate the employee had been delegated to the assistant secretary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner director of an institution and chairman of the institutional board of review's petition for a writ of certiorari to the appellate court. The appellate court had dismissed respondent prisoner's appeal of an order that required the board to afford respondent another parole hearing and to proceed solely on facts and evidence as they existed when the board originally considered respondent for parole and that if the board elected to grant parole, such was not to be subject to gubernatorial approval. In addition, the court granted a stay of the circuit court's order until its decision. Petitioner's notice of appeal, filed within 30 days of the revised judgment, was timely. The appeal was authorized by the Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md. Code Ann. art. 27, &sect; 645A(e). The appellate court erred in dismissing the appeal. The court also noted that the ordering of a new parole hearing was an available type of relief in a habeas corpus case.

The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed the trial court's ruling refusing to void the action. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that the council member was prohibited from voting on an incinerator pursuant to Montgomery County Code &sect; 19A-7(a), which disqualified a council member from voting in a matter in which he had a financial interest. The taxpayers argued that because the council member owned stock in the stock in the company that owned the land where the incinerator was to be built, he should have been disqualified from voting and the vote overturned. The court upheld the lower court's ruling and allowed the vote to stand. In so holding, the court found that 1) Montgomery County Code &sect; 19A-22(b), which allowed a court to void an action taken by an official or employee with a conflict of interest, impermissibly attempted to vest in the court a nonjudicial power; 2) &sect; 19A-22(b) was severable from the remainder of the county ethics law; 3) &sect; 19A-7(a) remained a valid part of the law, but could not be invoked as the basis for invalidating the incinerator vote, because improper legislative motive is not sufficient to set aside legislation; and 4) mere ownership of stock by a legislator who cast a critical vote was an insufficient basis for legislation invalidation.</SPAN></P>

Thus, it was error for the trial court to grant the state summary judgment against appellant's claims. It should have granted appellant's motion for partial summary judgment on the ground that &sect; 10-708 violated procedural due process protections because under &sect; 10-708, the state was prohibited from non-consensual administration of drugs to a mentally competent adult under non-emergency circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court found that the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, and the Noise Control Act of 1972, 49 U.S.C.S. App. &sect;&sect; 1301 et seq., invalidated only one condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A small commercial airport was found to have exceeded its conditional use permit and applied for another. Conditions attached to the new permit included restricting flights to daytime hours, restricting flights to one every 15 minutes, and requiring that pilots use particular landing patterns. The trial court found all three to be preempted by federal law. The court agreed completely with the trial court, finding that congress had indicated an intent to preempt the entire field of aircraft operations in navigable airspace in the Noise Control Act of 1972, among other statutes. The court, therefore, held that the neighbors could not enforce any local zoning restriction that impinged on aircraft operation. While the lower appellate court had found only that the landing pattern restriction was preempted, the court found that the timing and noise restrictions were similarly preempted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower appellate court's holding. The court remanded the case for affirmance of the trial court's judgment in favor of the airport that found that the zoning restrictions were preempted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney excepted to the findings of facts, conclusions of law, and recommendations brought before the court in a disciplinary action initiated by petitioner Attorney Grievance Commission. The court held that respondent's single failure to appear before the court on behalf of his client or to enter his written appearance could constitute neglect under the Code of Professional Responsibility DR 6-101(A)(3). The respondent's inadvertence, lack of persistent pattern or conduct, or lack of prejudice to the client properly went to the issue of mitigation rather than the fact of violation. The court held that Code of Professional Responsibility DR 6-101(A)(5) should not be read to apply only to particular egregious conduct but a single inadvertent failure to appear in court could constitute conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The court held that respondent's advertisement, in which he solicited &quot;Palimony&quot; suits did not violate Md. Lawyers' R. Prof. Conduct 7.1 because the term &quot;Palimony&quot; did not refer to a nonexistent action. The court determined that reprimand was an appropriate sanction for the respondent's derelictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a fire fighter/paramedic from December 1985 through May 1987.

On August 25, 1987, in another case, the board voided the policy that eligibility for the pay differential depended upon completion of the probationary period. The employee filed a grievance on October 7, 1987, complaining that he had not received the pay differential during his employment. The personnel director held that the grievance was not timely filed, and the board denied a request for a hearing. The employee appealed to the circuit court, which ordered the board to conduct a hearing. The court of special appeals reversed, and the employee sought review. The court granted certiorari and reversed. The record did not disclose whether or when the employee should reasonably have known of an automatic entitlement under the revised policy. A hearing was necessary to determine whether the grievance was timely filed.</SPAN></P>

The court, upon its own motion, could correct any plain error in the jury instruction, without an objection from defense counsel, where the error was material and affected defendant's right to a fair trial. To prove assault with the intent to murder, the state had to prove a specific intent to kill. Assault with the intent to kill, a statutory crime was held to be distinct from assault with the intent to do bodily harm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent attorney as counsel in a single personal injury action charged his clients a contingent fee of 75 percent of the gross amount recovered after trial and appellate review, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland charged the attorney with misconduct. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Maryland) found the contingency fee in violation of Md. Code of Prof. Responsibility DR 2-106(A) (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney charged two of the clients fees totaling $ 471,424 on their combined gross recoveries of $ 628,565. Under the initial fee agreement, the attorney undertook to pursue the claims of his clients through all appeals. The court held that inadequacy of compensation furnished no justification for the attorney to seek a new agreement with his clients to increase his fee for work he had already agreed to do. In seeking the increase, the attorney also crossed the 50 percent line and acquired a greater interest in the outcome of the litigation than his clients. Without passing upon whether there could ever be circumstances justifying a contingent fee in excess of 50 percent, the court held that it was generally a violation of Md. Code of Prof. Responsibility DR 2-106(A) (1986) for the attorney's stake in the result to exceed the client's stake. The court sustained the findings and conclusion of the circuit court judge over the attorney's exceptions. Because this was a particularly aggravated case of greed overriding professionalism, the court suspended the attorney from the practice of law for 18 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the 75 percent contingency fee excessive. The attorney's suspension would begin 30 days from the filing of the court's opinion. The court also ordered that the attorney should pay all costs as taxed, including the costs of all transcripts for which sum judgment was entered in favor of the Attorney Grievance Commission against the attorney.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The protestor was part of a group that gathered outside of an abortion clinic to protest abortion. The protestor became so loud that several residents complained about the level of the noise. A police officer responded to the complaints and arrested the protestor when he again began to shout his message. On appeal, the court stated that enactments should construed to be valid where feasible. In construing the language of &sect; 121 the court held that &quot;unseemly&quot; modified &quot;loud&quot; and meant unreasonably loud in the circumstances. Construed in that manner &sect; 121was content neutral, narrowly tailored to serve a significant State interest, and did not inhibit the use of various alternative channels of communication. The court held that this interpretation of &sect; 121 gave sufficient notice of what conduct was penalized, and thus, &sect; 121 was not void for vagueness. The court also imposed a requirement of prior warning by police, so that a speaker would be made aware that further communication at the offensive volume level could be cause for an arrest. Properly applied &sect; 121 reached only that conduct which could be regulated consistent with the First Amendment, and thus, &sect; 121 was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation and its employee filed an action against appellees, state, county, and individuals, challenging Chapter 244, Acts of 1989. The Circuit Court for Prince George's County (Maryland) upheld Chapter 244 in all respects. The court granted the corporation's petition for certiorari before any proceedings were had in the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapter 244 was an emergency measure that was designed to extend the life of the county's energy tax. It contained both ethics and tax provisions. The corporation and its employees challenged the legislation, and the trial court upheld its validity. The court granted certiorari and reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that Chapter 244 violated the &quot;one-subject&quot; constitutional mandate found in Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 29. The court also held that the &quot;ethics&quot; provisions were severable from the &quot;tax&quot; provisions, and that the latter survived the constitutionally required demise of the former. The court noted that the &quot;ethics&quot; provisions were unrelated to raising revenue. The court found that Chapter 244 did not deal with &quot;many related aspects&quot; of &quot;comprehensive legislation in a given field.&quot; Rather, Chapter 244 dealt with one aspect of zoning-related ethics and with limited taxing authority.

The labor unions representing the employees failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement with the City. The court held: 1) that the program did not involve random post-employment drug testing; 2) that the results were not used for criminal prosecutions without the employees' consent; 3) that the employees had three types of notice, there was no observation of urination, and test results were confidential; 4) that the City's interest in the safety of its uniformed police and fire personnel, their co-workers, and the public outweighed the negligible private interest; 5) that the potential for abuse or harassment by the City was negligible; 6) that a reasonable suspicion requirement was unwarranted; 7) that the testing was not facially at odds with the Fourth Amendment; and 8) that the trial court erred in enjoining the City from enforcing its program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinances required that the pension systems divest their holdings in companies doing business in South Africa. The trustees argued that the ordinances delegated legislative power to a private entity by instructing that entities doing business in South Africa be identified by reference to an annual report. The trustees argued that the ordinances violated the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution by modifying the manner in which the pension funds were invested. The court granted the beneficiaries' motion to intervene, holding that a ruling upholding the ordinances would be res judicata in a separate action by the beneficiaries and that the trustees, municipal officials, could not adequately represent their interests in the pensions. The court upheld the ordinances finding no impermissible delegation of legislative power or violation of the Contract Clause. The list was merely an advisory reference. The ordinances may have affected pension systems' profitability and required consideration of social consequences, but the consequences were minimal. In addition, divestiture could not occur unless the it was consistent with the trustees' duty of prudence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, upholding the city's ordinances as constitutional. The court modified the circuit court's judgment by granting the beneficiaries' motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>

Following the issuance of the writ of mandamus by the circuit court, all parties appealed. However, prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, the court issued a writ of certiorari and held that the circuit court erred in issuing the writ of mandamus because &sect; 39(e) was the Board's exclusive remedy.

The tax court affirmed the denial of the claim for October 1977 to April 1979, but ordered a refund from the period of May 1979 to April 1982. The circuit court affirmed the order on the 1977-79 claim, but reversed on the 1979-82 claim. The court of special appeals affirmed. On further appeal, the telephone company claimed that the use tax was unconstitutional because it was a tax on property in interstate commerce. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the use tax did not violate the commerce clause. The court ruled that the telephone company had power and control over the directories at all times, therefore it was liable for payment of the use taxes. The tax imposed on the telephone company related to benefits provided by the state. Finally, the court held that the directories did not fall within the coverage of the claimed exemption.</SPAN></P>

The defendant urged that the sentence of life imprisonment without parole was illegal, evidence seized when he was arrested and his confession should have been suppressed, and the evidence was insufficient. The court held that the sentence of life imprisonment without parole did not deny the defendant due process of law nor subject him to cruel and unusual punishment. The trial judge followed all the required procedures, and life in prison was not worse than death. The defendant's warrantless arrest was proper because the totality of the circumstances showed probable cause. The fact that he was not taken before a judicial officer until almost nine hours after his arrest was only a factor to be considered in deciding the voluntariness and admissibility of his confession. Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 10-912 (1973, Repl. Vol. 1984). The defendant's confession was corroborated by physical evidence surrounding the victim. The gunshot wounds showed that he was murdered. The defendant's confession corroborated an accomplice's testimony that the defendant tried to blow up the victim and his car.</SPAN></P>

Ann. Code art. 81, &sect;&sect; 331, 383 (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol.), assessed the full amount of the corporation's sales and use tax against him as an officer. The president appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Charles County (Maryland), affirming the judgment of the Maryland Tax Court finding the president liable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president had formed a corporation with two others and assumed the position of president. The president had asserted that he had no involvement in the corporation's financial affairs and that &sect;&sect; 331 and 383 should be interpreted in a manner which limited personal liability to only those corporate officers who either had the duty to collect and pay the taxes or who had a duty to supervise such payment. The court rejected such argument and affirmed the circuit court's determination that upheld the imposition of the tax assessment against the president. Sections 331 and 383 unambiguously placed the full amount of the sales and use tax on any corporate officer. The court found that when the president accepted one of the statutorily designated offices he became individually responsible for the payment of the corporation's sales and use taxes. Further, the court found that the statutes did not unconstitutionally deprive him of property without due process of law because the president failed to meet his burden of proving lack of a rational basis and that the rational basis for holding officers liable for tax payment, the collection of taxes which may have gone unpaid, was obvious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court, which held the president liable for the full tax assessment based on the corporation's sales and use tax.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was a habitual offender, so he was sentenced to life in prison. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed. The court declined to review the case. The United States Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration in light of its recent decision regarding peremptory challenges. The appellate court reversed and ordered that a new trial be held. The appellate court also denied the State's motion for reconsideration. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's reversal of defendant' conviction and the order for a new trial. The court found that defendant had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in his equal protection challenge to the jury venire. Since defendant and the excused jurors were not of the same race, defendant failed to meet the first prong of Batson. Neither could defendant, by was of peremptory challenges, assert a Sixth amendment claim of fair-cross-section deprivation in the composition of his jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee golf club sought declaratory and injunctive relief from appellant state's denial of an exemption from a tax assessment. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Maryland) entered summary judgment for the club on its claim that Chapter 334 violated the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment (E.R.A.) and that the unconstitutional language was not severable from the overall prohibition of sex discrimination in Chapter 334. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exchange for a favorable tax assessment, the club entered into a 50-year agreement with the state to maintain its land as open spaces. However, due to the club's allegedly discriminatory membership policies, the state assessed the club's lands at their full cash value. The club sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The court denied relief, holding that (1) Chapter 334 was intended to have retroprospective effect; (2) Chapter 334 did not violate the Contract Clause; (3) Chapter 334 was not a special law prohibited by Md. Const. art. III, &sect; 33; and (4) Chapter 334 did not violate the constitutional freedom of association rights of the club's members. Finally, although the periodic discrimination exception in Chapter 334 violated the E.R.A., the court held that the unconstitutional language was severable from the overall prohibition of sex discrimination in Chapter 334. Thus, in sum, the club had no right to a favorable tax assessment under the &quot;open lands&quot; exemption where it continued to discriminate on the basis of sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of certiorari to decide whether an employer that continued to pay wages to a disabled employee who had sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of her employment was making payments of &quot;compensation&quot; for purposes of the statutory provision governing Workmen's Compensation, Md. Code art. 101, &sect; 40(c). The court, however, was unable to reach that question because the employer lacked the ability to appeal the circuit court decision to the Court of Special Appeals. The original administrative decision denied the employee's claim for temporary total disability. On the employee's appeal to the circuit court, the decision was again in the employer's favor. Since the only part of the order that was appealable was wholly favorable to the employer, the employer lacked standing to appeal that judgment to the Court of Special Appeals.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state administrative board of election laws, Md. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was sentenced to death following a murder and felony conviction. On post conviction review, the lower court held that at sentencing, the state had introduced criminal convictions obtained under unconstitutional procedures. After a new sentencing hearing was ordered, the state sought review, and appellee sought review, claiming a new trial was required because of ineffective counsel. In affirming, the court rejected the ineffective assistance claim because appellee had not demonstrated a reasonable probability of innocence if counsel had utilized information concerning the possibility of other suspects. Assuming arguendo that the information would have raised reasonable doubt, the court held there had been no prejudice because appellee was nevertheless guilty of first-degree murder under Md. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for second degree rape and false imprisonment on the basis that defense counsel had interposed a defense of not criminally responsible under Md.

There was conflicting testimony at trial whether defendant was suffering from delusions, including being watched by government agencies. The state contended the decision to assert the plea was a tactical trial decision like any other affirmative defense. The court disagreed and held that defendant who was competent was entitled to decide whether the defense of criminal responsibility was to be interposed because its consequences were so grave and personal that competent defendant should have the right to make his own decision whether to impose that plea. A successful plea did not mean freedom. In this case, the plea interfered with defendant's defense of consent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state board and private citizens, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Talbot County (Maryland) that granted a declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiffs, county council and county attorney. The circuit court held that a voter-initiative provision in the county's charter was unconstitutional because it violated Md. Const. art. XI-A. The state board was enjoined from placing the private citizens' initiative on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private citizens pursuant to the voter-initiative provision sought to place an initiative on the ballot. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. Initially, the court held that there was a justiciable issue under the Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Md. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. &sect; 3-409(a), because the county attorney had standing to bring the declaratory judgment action in his personal capacity as a taxpayer, and he alleged sufficient harm by claiming that a vote on the initiative pursuant to an unconstitutional charter provision could waste taxes he paid. Therefore, whether the county council had standing was irrelevant. Furthermore, the local board and private citizens were proper defendants and so an actual controversy existed because even if they had no duty to defend the voter-initiative provision, their exercise of rights under that provision threatened the rights of the county attorney and county council. The court upheld the finding that the voter-initiative provision was unconstitutional because it violated Md. Const. art. XI-A, &sect; 3, which vested the county council with the sole authority to initiate legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the declaratory judgment that held the voter-initiative provision in the county charter violated the Maryland Constitution. The court also affirmed the enjoinment of the state board from placing the private citizens' initiative on the ballot. The court also affirmed the denial of the private citizens' claim for attorney's fees, expenses, and costs incurred in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to 25 years in prison, without the possibility of parole, under Maryland's habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Md. Ann. Code art. 27, &sect; 643B(c) (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol., 1987 Cum. Supp.). Defendant's conviction for daytime housebreaking was his fourth conviction for a crime of violence in 10 years. The Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) affirmed the circuit court's sentence, and the court subsequently granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his 25-year sentence, without the possibility of parole, was cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant reasoned that the Maryland Legislature erred in classifying housebreaking as a violent crime for purposes of &sect; 643(B)(c) and that his sentence was, therefore, disproportionate. The court affirmed. The court, after noting that proportionality challenges typically failed, held that substantial deference was due the legislature and sentencing courts in challenges to the propriety of sentences. An extended proportionality analysis was not required given the seriousness of the daytime crime, the stringent dictates of &sect; 643(B)(c), and the deference due to the legislative sentencing scheme. In particular, defendant's past and present criminal conduct made clear that his sentence was within constitutional limits. Even if a proportionality analysis had been required, the sentence would have been valid because daytime housebreaking was a serious offense with a potential for violence, and the sentence was proportionate to sentences imposed for other crimes in Maryland as well as other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence under Maryland's habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the owner failed to pay assessments as assessed by the development, the development provided written notice to the owner as required under &sect; 14-203 of its intention to create a lien against the owner's condominium. The owner then brought the current and claimed, among other things, that the statutory lien provisions were unconstitutional. On appeal from the trial court's ruling striking &sect; 14-203 as unconstitutional, the court recognized that the owner was entitled under &sect; 14-203 to obtain a hearing by filing an action in circuit court against the lien claimant. Assuming that was done, no lien could have been imposed prior to holding a hearing. This opportunity for hearing was found sufficient, and &sect; 14-203 was deemed constitutional despite the fact that the owner was required to file suit in order to obtain the hearing. Because the action required was not complex and because the burden of proof and burden of pressing forward with the lien proceedings were on the person attempting to assert the lien, &sect; 14-203 was found to satisfy all constitutional procedural due process requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court ruling and remanded the action for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney grievance commission received complaints concerning letters mailed to very recently injured persons informing the latter of the availability of the attorney's legal services. Subsequently, an inquiry panel of the bar served the attorney with a certified letter in lieu of subpoena. The letter required the attorney's attendance at a hearing and demanded the production of various documents. In response, the attorney filed a motion for a protective order to quash the subpoena. The attorney appeared at the inquiry panel hearing but refused to answer questions or produce the subpoenaed materials. Consequently, the commission filed a motion for contempt. The circuit court's order directed the attorney to produce certain documents. The commission subsequently filed a motion to amend. After much procedural wrangling, the circuit court granted the motion to amend and compelled the attorney to appear and answer questions before the inquiry panel. On appeal, the court concluded that it was unreasonable to burden the attorney with producing the requested documents or to require him to testify at an inquiry panel hearing.</SPAN></P>

The driver did not receive a supplementary laboratory technician's report until the day of trial. At trial, the hospital technician was not present, and the report was suppressed. The doctor appeared as a witness and the emergency service report, including the test results, was admitted into evidence. The special appeals court held it was error to admit evidence showing the result of the toxic screen test and reversed the driver's conviction. The court disagreed, noting that the testing was performed in the hospital and not by a police laboratory and no extensive foundation needed to be laid. The court held that the testimony of the emergency room physician showing that the emergency service report was made in the &quot;regular course of business&quot; and that the toxicological screen of the driver's blood and urine was &quot;pathologically germane to treatment&quot; was sufficient to justify admission.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part, and reversed in part, concluding that Md. Code art. 81, &sect; 280A required the inclusion of gross-up in appellant's taxable Maryland income. The court held that the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV did not preclude Maryland from taxing appellant's gross-up income for the tax year 1976. The court found that the tax court was legally wrong when it concluded that it had to exclude the domestic placement income (DPI) from apportionment merely because the interest payers were independent of appellant. The court held that the DPI was subject to apportionment. The court concluded that appellant should have had an opportunity to develop facts as to the extent of any disproportionality, in light of the principles established in the case.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded in both cases for proceedings consistent with the required application of the Batson analysis. The court explained in each instance, petitioner and appellant were convicted by a substantially white or totally white jury after most or all potential jurors who were black were excluded from jury service by peremptory challenges exercised by the state. The court found each man made a sufficient prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination to justify remand for further inquiry. The court observed once a defendant made a prima facie showing of discrimination, the state was required to articulate a legitimate race neutral explanation for the challenges and such reasonably specific explanation had to be related to the particular case to be tried. The court explained once such reason was submitted, the court was required to decide whether discrimination was ultimately established in view of the facts and context.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, defendants challenged judgments from the Court of Special Appeals (Maryland) that determined that separate convictions and sentences for both child abuse and second-, third-, or fourth-degree sexual offense were not improper in cases in which the state relied on and proved the sexual offense to sustain the child abuse conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate trials in different courts, defendants were convicted on several counts of sex-related offenses and child abuse. At trial, the state relied on and proved the sexual offenses to sustain the child abuse convictions. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, the court ruled that it could not be determined with precision from the juries' verdicts whether the convictions of child abuse were sustained by the sexual offense convictions, and that such an ambiguity was to be resolved in favor of defendants. Specifically, the court ruled that it could not tell whether the juries' general verdicts of guilty were based on the use of sexual offenses as lesser included offenses, or elements, of child abuse, or whether the child abuse verdicts were based on other reasons, such as some sort of sexual molestation which the juries thought did not rise to the level of a sexual offense in any degree. The court therefore vacated defendants' convictions on the sex offenses.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the police officer's motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, and granted the remaining defendants' motion to dismiss based on immunity. On certiorari, the court affirmed the dismissal of the non-constitutional tort claims against the police officer because the officer did not knowingly or deliberately search the wrong house, and thus, the mistake was not malicious. However, because an official who violated an individual's rights under the Maryland Constitution was not entitled to any immunity, the constitutional issues were remanded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motor carrier organization challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), which declared a marker tax imposed under Maryland's Road Tax on Motor Carriers Act, specifically Md.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the state officials, counties and city conceded that the marker tax imposed under Maryland's Road Tax on Motor Carriers Act, specifically Md.

The trial court permitted the continued collection of the marker tax. The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the tax was unconstitutional, but reversed the trial court's decision to refuse to enter an immediate injunction against further enforcement of the tax. In requesting the injunction against future enforcement of the statute, the motor carrier organization did not seek retrospective relief because the operative event was not the formulation of the plan to spend future tax dollars, but was the actual imposition of tax liability. Extraordinary circumstances did not exist to delay the effective date of a decision where the financial impact from the injunction on the state was not especially significant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and found guilty by a jury of attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, assault with intent to rob, and simple assault. The trial court overruled the jury verdict, believing that the verdict was against the weight and credibility of the evidence, and ordered that defendant be retried. State of Maryland filed a writ of prohibition with the court, arguing that the trial court overstepped its authority to grant defendant a new trial.

The court also determined that the trial court was within its statutory and constitutional right when it weighed the credibility and sufficiency of the evidence and overruled the jury verdict.
