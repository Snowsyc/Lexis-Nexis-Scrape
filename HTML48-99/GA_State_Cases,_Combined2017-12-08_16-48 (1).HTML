</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that the trial court erred in failing to quash and dismiss their arrest warrants and the indictments issued thereon because the issuing magistrate had a pecuniary interest in their issuance in violation of the Constitution because he was paid according to the warrants. The court rejected the claim, holding that defendants made no motion to suppress evidence, either testimonial or physical, which they contended resulted from their arrest pursuant to warrants they contended were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences, finding that a review of the evidence adduced at the trial in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict showed that a rational trier of fact could have found defendants guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further ruled that the trial court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal on the issue of murder at the close of the state's evidence and that the testimony of the state's expert, a forensic pathologist, that in his opinion in most cases a parent who abuses a child does not intend to cause death did not preclude submission of this case to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment from the Court of Appeals of Georgia that convicted him of possession of a machine gun in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2906 (1968) and O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2907 (1968) and possession of a silencer in violation of the Firearms and Weapons Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-9915a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of a machine gun and possession of a silencer. On review, the issue raised was whether the trial court erred in convicting defendant of possession of a machine gun and possession of a silencer. The court found that of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2906 (1968) did not shift the burden to defendant and hence the question raised on certiorari as to shifting the burden of proof was not presented by O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 26-2906, 26-2907. It was found that the trial court did not charge that the burden of proof of exemption was upon defendant. It was held that the trial judge charged the presumption of innocence, the State's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to each element of the crime, and that the State's burden of proof in a criminal case never shifted to the accused to prove his innocence, omitting all reference to the statutory language as to negativing exemptions and the statutory burden of proof upon defendant. Thus, the court held that although the issue of exemptions was raised by defendant's request to charge, no burden shifting charge was given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband sought review of an order from the Cobb Superior Court (Georgia), which found him in contempt of court for willfully disobeying a previous order arising out of a case involving divorce, alimony, custody, child support, and property division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order held the husband in contempt of court, but allowed him to purge himself by paying $ 15,000, which was the minimal costs for repair of the marital home that was awarded to appellee wife; the ad valorem taxes for 1978, and the wife's attorney fees. Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that the sanction imposed against the husband was constitutionally permissible because while imprisonment was ordered, the husband was permitted an opportunity to purge himself, and the case was one of civil contempt. The decree of divorce was entered in February of 1978. Because ad valorem tax liability was determined by ownership of the property on the first of the year, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-6202, and because they were a reasonable family expense incurred prior to the divorce, the court did not modify its original decree by subsequently ordering the husband to pay the taxes. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding him in willful contempt because he was unwilling to arrange for the repairs of the home, and he failed to even begin the repairs that were ordered completed within six months of the first contempt order. Attorney fees were available in a contempt case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, employer and its insurer, sought review of an order of the Clayton Superior Court (Georgia), which reversed and remanded the affirmance by the Georgia Board of Workers Compensation (board) of an administrative law judge's finding that appellee widower was not partially dependent on his deceased wife and not entitled to benefits under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 114-414, and sustained the widower's constitutional challenge to &sect; 114-414.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the death of his wife the widower applied for workers compensation benefits, which were denied on the ground that he was not partially dependent on his deceased wife. The widower challenged the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 114-414(a) on the basis that it denied him equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment by providing a conclusive presumption of dependency for a wife but not for a husband. The trial court reversed the findings of the administrative law judge and the board and held that the dependency of the widower had to be determined in exactly the same manner as the dependency of a widow. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court affirmed the trial court's declaration that different treatment of widows and widowers was unconstitutional based upon a United States Supreme Court decision. The court reversed the extension of the benefit of the conclusive presumption of dependency to widowers, because it found that legislative intent could best be accomplished by eliminating the conclusive presumption of dependency of widows. The court remanded the issue of the deceased employee's weekly wage for redetermination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's two victims, a witness, and others arranged to meet defendant at a park to settle a dispute over cocaine. When they arrived they were met by an ambush planned by defendant. One victim died at the scene and the other died 10 days later. At trial, the witness and a detective testified that the hospitalized victim told them that defendant had beaten him, but that he did not see defendant shoot him. The trial court admitted the testimony on the ground that the statements were dying declarations. On appeal, defendant contended that the testimony was not admissible because it related to the person who beat him, not to the cause of death or the identity of the murderer. The court disagreed and affirmed. The victim's statements showed that defendant was a party to the ambush and strongly suggested that defendant had shot him. The court rejected defendant's claim that the dying declaration had to be made at the time of the crime. As to the victim who died at the scene, the death certificate showed that he was dead on arrival at the hospital, having been injured shortly before. Such evidence supported a finding that he died as a result of shots fired from defendant's ambush.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant hit another vehicle while intoxicated, thereby killing two persons. The appellate court affirmed. The Uniform Rules of the Road Act was not unconstitutional by having different language in the caption then in the body of the law. Nor did the statute violate due process by failing to require distributors to label alcoholic beverages on the effects of alcohol. The vehicular homicide statute properly punished the intent to commit the act.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 68A-902.1, covering blood tests, did not unconstitutionally discriminate against alcohol users over drug users. Defendant was not convicted of speeding, and thus, any misjoinder with the homicide charge was harmless error. Character evidence of defendant being found drunk weeks after the accident was admissible to show the bend of mind and course of conduct. Hypothetical questions to the expert about alcohol consumption were harmless error as was testimony from witnesses regarding the speed of defendant's vehicle. The superior court was not required to instruct the jury on the effect of a breach of the rule of sequestration. Defendant's work records were admissible as business records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband filed a petition under &sect; 30-220(b) to modify his alimony payments required under the parties' settlement agreement, which was merged into the divorce decree. The wife appealed from the denial of her motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed such order in part. The court held that the right to terminate alimony payments under &sect; 30-220(b) cam into existence after the agreement was made a party of the decree and therefore was not a &quot;known right&quot; that the husband could have waived in the agreement. The court also held that there was conflicting on the wife's claim that she was not engaged in voluntary cohabitation with a third party; hence such was an issue of fact for the jury. Moreover, the court held that &sect; 30-220(b) was not unconstitutional for vagueness because all of the words had their common meaning or could be looked up in the dictionary. However, the court reversed in part the denial of the wife's summary judgment motion, holding that the distribution of money described in paragraph six of the agreement was not alimony, noting that it would not terminate on the husband's death, the wife's death, or the wife's remarriage.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and motor vehicle theft, and he was given the death sentence. Defendant appealed, and the court vacated the death sentence, holding that the trial court had improperly excluded for cause veniremen who could not impose the death penalty on a 16 year old because those veniremen would have given weight to defendant's youth as a mitigating circumstance. Moreover, the robbery conviction was vacated because it was a lesser included offense of felony murder and the court gave defendant the benefit of the doubt in the trial court's failure to distinguish between malice murder and felony murder in the jury instructions. The court affirmed the remainder of the appealed judgment, however, holding that defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel despite his later disagreement with his trial attorney's strategic choices.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant argued that Ga.

Moreover, the trial court's charge to the jury on the definition of escape was substantially the same as the definition in &sect; 26-2501 and was not erroneous. Also, the trial court did not err in failing to grant defendant's motion for a directed verdict when defendant did not make out a prima facie defense of entrapment. In addition, after a dispute between defendant and his counsel regarding the conduct of the defense, the trial court did not err in holding that either defendant or his counsel could question each witness, but that they could not both question the same witness. Finally, the sentence was within the statutory limits and the fact that it was greater sentence than was imposed on situated defendants was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An amendment to a city employee retirement plan omitted early retirement benefits, but included a mathematical factor that had been included in a written recommendation. On appeal, the city contended that it was entitled to correct the typographical mistake that resulted in the factor being omitted from the formula. Upon review, the court held that the Georgia constitution precluded the application of an amendatory statute or ordinance if its effect reduced rather than increased the benefits payable. Once an employee contributes to a retirement plan it becomes part of the contract of employment. Yet, the impairment clause did not preclude the reformation of the contract especially since the omission erroneously increased the amount of benefits, rather then decreasing them from established levels.</SPAN></P>

Defendant attacked the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2534.1(b)(7). He argued that any injury grave enough to cause death was an aggravated battery within &sect; 27-2534.1(b)(7) and therefore the statute was overbroad and vague in violation of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed and held that the Supreme Court of the United States had upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 27-2534.1(b)(7) when attacked on the same grounds. The court concluded that under the evidence, the nature of the injuries was of the type universally condemned as outrageously or wantonly vile or inhuman as to go to the very core of &sect; 27-2534.1(b)(7). The victim was struck on the head with a karate chop and fell over bleeding. She was pulled from the car with such force that her elbow was dislocated. While still alive, she was beaten with a tire jack with such force that her face from the top of the eyes down was completely missing, and parts of her jaw and skull were found within a nine foot radius of the body. The murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it was distinguishable from ordinary murders in which the death penalty was not appropriate. The victim was not killed instantaneously, she was not a member of defendant's family, nor was she subjecting him to any emotional trauma. She gave him no reason whatsoever to assault her. Moreover, defendant showed no remorse for the killings and attempted in every manner to hide his crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A widow filed a medical malpractice action against a physician for her husband's wrongful death. The trial court granted the hospital's motion to intervene to obtain a protective order limiting discovery of the hospital medical review committee pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 88-3204. The trial court granted a protective order prohibiting all discovery of two physicians and limiting discovery of the appellee physician to his treatment of the widow's husband. The widow appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Section 88-3204 did not violate due process because its limits on discovery bore a reasonable relation to the proper legislative purpose of fostering quality medical services by preserving the candor necessary for the committee's effective functioning. The separate classification of medical malpractice actions was not arbitrary or unreasonable under the equal protection clause and the statute did not deprive plaintiffs of their access to the courts. The order was reversed insofar as it prohibited the physicians on the committee from being asked hypothetical questions based on facts in evidence which had been obtained from nonprivileged sources.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part a judgment limiting a widow's discovery of physicians on a hospital medical review committee in her medical malpractice action against a physician for her husband's wrongful death, finding that a statute limiting discovery of such committees was constitutional. The judgment was reversed insofar as it prohibited calling physicians on the committee to testify as expert witnesses on the same basis as other experts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former wife argued that the parties, through their settlement agreement, waived the statutory right to seek modification of the permanent alimony agreed to therein and made part of the court's decree.

The former wife also argued that the former husband could not pursue and action under &sect; 30-220(a) because he had filed a prior such action for modification. The court held that the two-year limitation did not apply to the live in lover statute, &sect; 30-220(b). The former wife also attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 30-220(b) by contending that the section denied her equal protection of the laws and due process rights. The court found that the classification of former spouses who had elected voluntarily to cohabit with a third party of a different sex in a meretricious relationship was a rational classification which furthered legitimate governmental objectives favoring the institute of marriage.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murder and sought review, contending that jurors were improperly excused for their conscientious objection to the death penalty, that a witness was not informed in camera of his privilege against testifying, and that he was not competent to stand trial. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that jurors were properly excused under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 59-806 (4) where they were irrevocably committed before the trial began to vote against the death penalty regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings. The trial court did not err in failing to advise appellant's stepfather of his privilege against testifying because if the privilege was based on self-incrimination then it belonged to the witness and could not be asserted by appellant and if it was premised upon Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 38-1205(a) it was not applicable because the testimony was material to a crime committed by a family member. The record reflected that appellant had been certified by physicians as competent to stand trial and that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the suspension of the licensee's driver's license under &sect; 68C-402 could not be considered a criminal punishment where it was accomplished administratively by a designated public officer without judicial action; therefore, the licensee was not placed in double jeopardy. The manner in which the driver's license was suspended did not deprive the licensee of procedural due process of law. Because the licensee had only a qualified right in his driver's license, the revocation of his license under &sect;&sect; 68C-401, -402 did not violate the prohibition against passage of retroactive statutes.

The court held that any due process argument was moot, as the inmate was afforded a hearing on his application.

The murders were committed in separate counties, which of necessity required that one murder be tried before the other. The subsequent acquittal simply had no bearing on the issue of whether the trier of fact was presented with sufficient evidence to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of an aggravating circumstance. The court found the evidence showed defendant killed his accomplice in the arson case who also happened to be a witness to murder to prevent any chance he would testify against him. The court found defendant's actions showed a complete depravity of mind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband appealed a trial court order declaring him indebted to the wife for attorney fees entered in conjunction with a final decree of divorce, asking that the court reverse the award of attorney fees because they were part of the wife's alimony award, which the court had previously reversed upon a finding that the statutes upon which the award was based were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court found that the trial court had correctly determined that the husband was obligated to pay the attorney fees award, noting that if it had intended to reverse the award based on the unconstitutionality of the alimony statutes, it would not have ruled, as it had in the husband's previous appeal, that the award was not excessive. The court noted that the trial court's power to award attorney fees was derivative and incidental to its inherent power to grant divorces and that such matters were generally left to the trial court's sound discretion. Because the husband had not contended that the trial court abused that discretion, the court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2902, a person committed a misdemeanor when he carried to or while at a public gathering any explosive compound, firearm, or knife designed for the purpose of offense and defense, and that for the purpose of the law public gathering included establishments at which alcoholic beverages were sold for consumption on the premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 74-9002 provided that parents who remained in Georgia after abandoning their minor children subjected themselves to misdemeanor punishment. On the other hand, parents who left Georgia after abandoning their minor children subjected themselves to felony punishment reducible to a misdemeanor. The court held that &sect; 74-9002 did not violate the United States Constitution. Persons charged with the commission of a crime were to be delivered up to the state having jurisdiction of the crime. Therefore, a person charged with a crime in Georgia who left Georgia and entered another state did not have a constitutionally protected right of free travel in interstate commerce that could be asserted to bar prosecution for the Georgia offense. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 74-9002 did not fall under the Fourteenth Amendment, as the classification appeared rationally related to a valid legislative purpose of causing parents to support their children. The Georgia General Assembly could have concluded that the parental support obligation was more difficult to enforce if the parent charged with child abandonment left the State of Georgia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff bank filed a lawsuit against defendants, the city and the county, seeking the refund of certain taxes that were assessed on the bank's tangible and intangible personal property, including motor vehicle taxes. The bank filed a motion for summary judgment which was denied. Defendants filed cross motions for summary judgment which were granted by the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia). The bank appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank was a national banking association. In 1975, defendants assessed taxes on the bank's tangible and intangible personal property, which the bank paid the taxes under protest. The only issue on appeal was the appropriate construction of the phrase &quot;No tax shall be assessed upon the capital of banks or banking associations, &quot; in 1975 Ga. Laws 147, 149. The dispute between the bank and defendants was whether the &quot;no tax on capital clause&quot; in the 1975 Act exempted national banks from all ad valorem taxes other than those authorized by the Act. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and directed the entry of an order granting the bank's motion for summary judgment. The court held that &quot;capital&quot; as used in the &quot;no tax on capital&quot; clause in the 1975 Act referred to capital assets; thus the 1975 Act did exempt the bank from ad valorem taxes levied on its personal property. The court stated that if the General Assembly had intended to alter the long standing effect of the &quot;no tax on capital&quot; clause it would have done so in clear and express terms.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the inmate's contention that his court appointed attorney was ineffective because he failed to challenge the composition of the grand jury because the inmate voluntarily relinquished his right to challenge the composition of the grand jury. The court found that because defendant was accused of a brutal double murder, was an inmate at a federal prison at the time of the indictment, and because there was information that the inmate's son might attempt to help him escape, the level of security at trial was reasonable and did not deprive the inmate of a his right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised the insanity defense at his jury trial for murder. Defendant was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. His motion for a new trial was overruled. In affirming the judgment, the court held that although an issue of insanity was presented to the jury, they could reject the testimony of defendant's expert witness and rely on the general presumption of sanity as well as other eyewitness testimony, and determine that he was not insane at the time of the murder. The court held that a rational fact finder could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that a jury charge which elaborated on the general presumption of sanity, taken as a whole, did not impermissibly shift the burden of persuasion. The court held that the evidence did not support defendant's requested charge on a theory of delusional compulsion, which was properly denied. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to declare a mistrial as a result of the introduction of evidence of defendant's character for violence because the trial judge specifically instructed the jury to disregard such evidence in reaching its verdict.</SPAN></P>

Laws 446, violated the state constitution in that it allowed a county to give county funds to municipalities, it was not authorized by the state constitution, and it was an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the Local Option Sales Tax Act (Act), 1979 Ga. Laws 446, was unconstitutional. The taxpayers claimed that the Act authorized a county to give county tax funds to municipalities in violation of the state constitution, the Act was not authorized by the state constitution, and it was an unlawful delegation of legislative power. Intervenors claimed the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause. The trial court held the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) the tax as authorized by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 91A-4601 et seq. was constitutional whether viewed as a joint county-city tax which the general assembly authorized in the exercise of its inherent power to tax, or viewed as a special district tax authorized by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-6102; (2) the tax was not a county tax being partially distributed to cities but was a joint city-county tax or a special district tax; (3) inequality among taxpayers in the same taxing authority as to the distribution of benefits was not unconstitutional; and (4) the local negotiation feature of the Act did not delegate the power to tax.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the challenged portion of &sect; 74-9902 indicated the duty to support did not simply arise at some indefinite time after the birth of the child but rather manifested the intention that both parents shared in the responsibility of the birth itself. The court concluded that the gender-based classification was reasonable under the circumstances. The court held that the trial court did not commit error in not permitting a continuance to allow further paternity tests. The court further found that the trial court did not err when it properly adjusted its charge to the jury to the evidence since only the putative father was on trial for abandonment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted under &sect; 68A-901, and he filed a demurrer contending that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court overruled the demurrer, and defendant was convicted on all charges. On review, the court found no error. The court held that &sect; 68A-901, Georgia's reckless driving statute, was sufficiently definite to inform a person of common intelligence as to when he was violating the law. The court held that mathematical certainty was not always obtainable, and that it was not necessarily a prerequisite to the adoption of a statute. The court held that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to require all charges tried together because defendant's speed, driving on the wrong side of the road, running stop signs, possession of marijuana, and vehicular homicide were so closely connected and related that the evidence regarding each transaction would have been admissible in the proof of the other.</SPAN></P>

The county challenged the judgment of the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), which held that no single-family zoning of the property was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and held that the county did not appeal the holding that the current single-family residential zoning was unconstitutional. The record did not disclose any challenge to any classification other than single-family residential before the county commissioners or before the trial court, so the trial court erred in declaring all single-family classifications unconstitutional as applied to the property. The case was to be remanded to the county commission for rezoning in accordance with the trial court's order that the single-family residential classification was unconstitutional. The developer would be allowed to raise constitutional challenges to the intervening classifications before the commission. The court held that the interest of would-be intervenor property owners was identical to that of the county and there was no showing that the county had been less than diligent in defending the suit, so the would-be intervenors did not come within the purview of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-124(a)(2) (intervention as of right). Also, the trial court properly declined to allow the would-be intervenors to intervene pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 81A-124(b)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision that all single-family classifications were unconstitutional as applied to the landowner's property. The court otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While at a dental office with other inmates, defendant seized the deputy's key, released himself from his cuffs, and ran. He eventually shot and killed a woman during his escape attempt. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the convictions and the death sentence. The grand jury was not selected in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 59-112 and defendant had no right in having any particular juror serve. The trial court did not err by admitting defendant's confession. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence during sentencing of alleged prior armed robberies and assault to show that defendant was in &quot;lawful custody&quot; and to show an aggravating circumstance for the death penalty under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2534.1(9). Evidence of mitigating circumstances that was allowed by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2534.1(b) and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2503 related to evidence about defendant particularly and did not include evidence involving the death penalty in general. The trial court's charge on malice was definitional and was not constitutionally impermissible. The sentence of death was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former wife's motion to dismiss the appeal was based on the allegation that the former husband did not satisfy the procedural requirements to appeal a judgment that held an individual in contempt of an alimony order. The former husband argued that &sect; 6-701.1 violated Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; II, para. IV, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3104, which provided that the Supreme Court was the court for the correction of errors in all alimony cases. On appeal, the court found that the appeal was subject to dismissal because the former husband failed to secure the prerequisite grant of an application for appeal within 30 days of entry of the complained of judgment. The court rejected the former husband's argument that the procedural statute was violative of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3104 because the section did not deny appellate review, but rather established an appellate review process and was expressly authorized by &sect; 2-3104.</SPAN></P>

The commission appealed, arguing that the issues were moot because the Franchise Practices Act had been amended after the trial court's order. The supreme court affirmed, holding that all of the challenged sections of the Franchise Practices Act were unconstitutional, null, and void. The court found that the 1979 amendment was a substantive re-enactment of the prior act.

</DIV>

He also argued in part that the referee who conducted the transfer hearing failed to comply with O.C.G.A. &sect; 24A-701(b) because he did not inform the juvenile that he was entitled to have a judge hear the matter, and that there was no written notice informing him of his right to a rehearing before a judge. The court reversed the judgment although it concluded that O.C.G.A. &sect; 24A-2501 was constitutional and it provided a transfer procedure that satisfied due process. However, the court observed that the district attorney's office did not contest the fact that the juvenile was not informed of his right to have the hearing on the transfer motion heard by a judge. The court also observed that there was no indication in the record that the juvenile had received written notice of his right to a rehearing before a judge, and the district attorney did not contest the juvenile's claim that no such notice was provided.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also attempted to quash a substitute accusation that was supported by an affidavit signed by a clerk. The court on appeal affirmed the order denying defendant's motion to quash. The court held that &sect; 68A-902(a)(1) was not so broad, general, vague, or indefinite that reasonable minds could differ as to its interpretation. The phrases &quot;driving under the influence,&quot; &quot;under the influence of alcohol,&quot; and &quot;to a degree which renders him incapable of safely driving&quot; as used in the statute were universally understood, not deficient as indefinite or unintelligible, and not unconstitutional. While the original traffic citation issued by the police was defective, the State was not prohibited from issuing a subsequent accusation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued that &sect; 79A-812 was unconstitutional because it violated the due process doctrine of vagueness and violated O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-1304 (1977) since it contained subject matter different from that expressed in the Title of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-8 (1979). The court stated that all statutes were presumed to have been enacted by the General Assembly with full knowledge of existing law and with reference to it and were to be construed in connection and in harmony with existing law. O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-3201 (1977) provided that one committed a conspiracy when he together with one or more persons conspired to commit a crime and any one or more such persons did any overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy. Section 79A-812 required with certainty an overt act for successful prosecution. Therefore, petitioner's first enumeration of error was without merit. Further, since &sect; 79A-812 proscribed conspiracy as defined by &sect; 26-3201 (agreement and act), said recitation unquestionably served notice that the text of the Act prohibited a conspiracy to commit a &sect; 79A-8 crime.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that &sect; 11 was not unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 11 was sufficiently related to a state interest so that it did not offend the Fourteenth Amendment. The state had an interest in providing for the orderly disposition of property based upon the presumed intention of the decedent. The court likened the situation to statutes that precluded in-laws from taking inherited property in place of a predeceased heir. The court held that the state action involved was not such an example of invidious discrimination that &sect; 11 had to be rendered unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that he was harmed by the trial court's denial of a continuance. There was no manifest abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to grant a mistrial due to the trial court's limiting instructions and the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. A murder could be committed in the commission of a felony so as to come within Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1101(b), although it did not take place until after the felony itself was technically completed, if the homicide was committed within the res gestae of the felony.

The children's action was filed under the wrongful death statute, Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court disagreed with the children's allegations that the state judiciary's interpretations of Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 105-1306 violated constitutionally protected rights that arose under U.S. Const. Amend. VI, VII, and XIV. The court also cited precedent which indicated that the laws did not authorize a child to bring an action for his mother's wrongful death against the estate of his stepfather since the mother, if alive, would have enjoyed no right of action against her husband, and a child's right of action for such a wrongful death was derivative of the mother. The court reasoned that the rationale was based on the &quot;family unity&quot; doctrine, which disallowed suits between members of a family as contrary to public policy, and noting that, under the judicial interpretations, the doctrine of interspousal immunity was a part of the wrongful death statute. The court indicated that once it interpreted a statute, that interpretation became an integral part of the statute. The court noted that the state legislature had not modified the doctrine of immunity, which was judicially engrafted upon a legislatively created right of action, unknown at common law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the children's wrongful death action against their stepfather.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to death for the murder and a consecutive prison term for the armed robbery and rape. Defendant appealed, contending numerous errors, including the admission of his written and videotaped confessions, which he claimed were not knowingly and voluntarily made, and that the video tape recording, pre-trial publicity and prosecutor's remarks influenced the jury into sentencing him to death. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that the fact that defendant was young and uneducated did not lead to the conclusion that he was incapable of freely and voluntarily waiving his constitutional rights. Consequently, the record supported the conclusion that the confessions were made freely and voluntarily by defendant. The court concluded that the evidence supported the jury's verdict and the statutory aggravating circumstances of armed robbery and rape beyond a reasonable doubt, which justified the jury's imposition of the death sentence and established that the jury was not influenced by prejudice or passion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother placed her children in foster care, following reports of child abuse. She later indicated that she wanted them back, but instead moved to Pennsylvania, moved to Maryland with another man, and subsisted on welfare. A petition for termination of parental rights was filed, and appellant's rights were terminated. She sought review, and the court affirmed. The court found that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24A-3201(a)(2) allowed termination because the children were deprived, as evidenced by moral unfitness, physical abuse, and abandonment. The court held that the service of process statute, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 24A-1702(a), was constitutional as it provided sufficient notice to nonresident parents; specifically, appellant was given 70 days notice of the termination hearing rather than the 5 required so she lacked standing to attack the statute. The lower court was the appropriate venue for the hearing because the children were residents of Georgia and appellant had sufficient minimum contacts through welfare payments from Georgia to exercise in personam jurisdiction over her. Consideration of a case file was not reversible error as the caseworker's testimony supported the findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed, finding a service of process statute constitutional because similarly situated non-residents were accorded equal treatment, venue was proper because the children were residents, and appellant had obtained welfare from Georgia, which established personal jurisdiction. The juvenile court's consideration of a caseworker's file was not reversible error, and there was evidence of deprivation to support the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The local constitutional amendment contained in 1962 Ga. Laws 808 provided tax exemptions for plant enlargement.

The court reversed the judgment in the tax appeal and affirmed the judgment on the denial of the summary judgment motion. The court determined that 1962 Ga. Laws 808 was not unconstitutional under the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court stated that once the Board allowed the first exemption under the Amendment, any discretion it had had as to whether to implement it had been exercised.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner purchased land in the county and formulated a plan to develop the tract for single family, residential, condominium, apartment, and commercial uses. He expended monies for engineering, grading, paving, landscaping, and for installing storm drains, gutters, and curbs. Thereafter the landowner granted an option to purchase a small tract of the property, conditional on the optionee being able to erect an apartment complex on the property. The optionee expended monies in developing the property. However, the optionee did not alter the land itself and did not apply for a building permit. Thereafter, the board granted the zoning request and zoned the land lot low density residential. The court reversed and held that the board's decision to zone the tract of land was arbitrary and discriminatory. The court found that only two percent of the unincorporated area of the county was under any kind of zoning restrictions whatsoever and that there was evidence that the board took action to zone property in the area only when someone filed a zoning petition. The court found that the board's zoning was akin to &quot;spot zoning,&quot; which violated Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 69-1207.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver ceased to be a Georgia resident after the suit was filed, but prior to service, such that she was served under the long arm statute, Ga.

The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the claim against the driver but affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the passenger and car owner. The court found, inter alia, that (1) although the collision occurred prior the 1977 amendment, the suit was not filed until after the effective date of the amendment and was not pending when the change in law occurred, such that the question of whether the driver had standing to complain of the retroactive aspects of the amendment was pretermitted; (2) the amendment was remedial in nature and did not affect the substantive rights of the driver; (3) a law which merely altered the procedure could, with perfect propriety, be made applicable to past as well as future transactions; and (4) the claim for negligent entrustment failed because the injured party did not allege that the passenger and owner had actual knowledge of the driver's incompetence.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted by a jury in the Richmond Superior Court (Georgia) of the lesser-included offense of statutory rape of his 11-year-old stepdaughter, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2018. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 26-2018 defined statutory rape as intercourse with a female under 14 years old. Defendant argued that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV in that it protected females exclusively; that the trial court erred by excluding testimony that the victim had in the past used objects for self-mutilation that caused injuries similar to those allegedly caused by defendant; and that the prosecutor committed misconduct by stating to the jury that expert testimony would show defendant's blood was found on the victim's clothes and defendant's clothes. A serology expert testified that the blood typing was inconclusive. The court affirmed and held that the statute was substantially related to the legislative objectives of protecting young girls from the unique physical and psychological damage resulting from sexual intercourse. Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 38-202.1, in a prosecution for rape or statutory rape, evidence of the victim's past sexual behavior was inadmissible. It was reprehensible for the prosecutor to have misstated the evidence in opening statement. But the assertion was still proven by way of defendant's testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a commercial bank, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Douglas County, Georgia, which held that former Code 1933, &sect; 41A-2101(a)(3) (see O.C.G.A. &sect; 7-1-460(a)(3)) was constitutional. The bank's request for approval so that it could declare a dividend to its shareholders was denied by appellee Department of Banking and Finance (Georgia) as being in violation of Department of Banking and Finance Rule 80-1-12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank attempted to declare a dividend to its stockholders but it's request for approval from the Department was denied as a violation of Rule 80-1-12 which was enacted under a grant of authority in former Code 1933, &sect; 41A-2101(a)(3) (see O.C.G.A. &sect; 7-1-460(a)(3)). The bank filed an action to declare &sect; 41A-2101(a)(3) unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The trial court ruled that &sect; 41A-2101(a)(3) was constitutional. On appeal the bank argued that &sect; 41A-2101(a)(3) and Rule 80-1-12 were unconstitutional because they authorized the Department to establish a crime. The court held that former Code 1933, &sect; 41A-9906(d) (see O.C.G.A. &sect; 7-1-843(d)), which declared certain acts to be misdemeanors, did not include &sect; 41A-2101(a)(3). The court concluded that the general assembly had not provided that the violation of the industry regulations that provided for the performance of certain acts in a certain manner would be a misdemeanor. Instead, the general assembly said that a violation of the rules and regulations of the Georgia Revenue Commissioner or in harmony with those things declared to be a crime by the terms and provisions of &sect; 41A should be a crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff legal publisher appealed an order from the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which denied its motion for summary judgment against defendants, competitor and code revision commission (commission), and granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in an action arising out of a legislative resolution that allowed the commission to contract with the competitor to revise the state's code.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the publisher's motion for summary judgment on all counts and granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on some counts. Both sides sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and directed the trial court to enter summary judgment for the defendants on all counts. The court held that Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VIII, para. VIII, which required competitive bidding, did not apply to the general assembly under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 102-109 and that the contract would not create a monopoly because it did not prevent the publisher from creating a competing product. The court held that the revision of the code was a legislative function and that it included publication of a new annotated code. The court held that the general assembly had final authority to approve the contract and that it had not improperly delegated its authority or granted an illegal subsidy.</SPAN></P>

The physician filed an action on behalf of himself all others similarly situated who were licensed to practice medicine in Georgia and who were not members of the association. The trial court entered summary judgment against the physician. On appeal, the physician contended that the delegation of the power of appointment to public office to a private organization was unconstitutional. The court noted that the power of state government, including to the power to appoint persons to a public office, had to reside in the public domain. By the terms of the statute, the association in effect controlled the appointments to the board. The association in turn was a private organization. Because the association was not accountable to the public, the statute had set forth an unconstitutional appointment process. Thus, the court reversed that portion of the trial court judgment that declared the statute was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the denial of his writ of habeas corpus, following his conviction on charges of murder, armed robbery, burglary, and aggravated assault and the imposition of the death penalty. The court rejected defendant's numerous allegations of error, including the assertion that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel. Defendant's counsel met the test of reasonably effective counsel. He satisfactorily presented the issue of possible mental defect or insanity, and was not required to personally pay for expert psychiatric witnesses or to extensively investigate each prospective juror before voir dire in the death penalty case. The court also concluded that defendant was not entitled to a state-paid psychiatrist to attempt to show his mental characteristics in possible mitigation of punishment, and that the state's closing argument was permissible. Finally, the court ruled that the state was not required by the Due Process Clause or Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2503 to give defendant notice of the aggravating circumstances it planned to prove. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

Laws 1253, was unconstitutional when applied retroactively to an alimony judgment entered prior to the effective date of the Act, in a proceeding by the husband seeking a modification of alimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties were divorced by a decree that incorporated a separation agreement providing periodic alimony and child support for the wife. The husband filed a petition for modification of alimony alleging in part that the wife was openly cohabiting with a man and had been doing so for about 10 months. The wife filed a motion to strike the allegations as to cohabitation on the grounds that the live in lover provision was unconstitutional in that it was applied retroactively and violated due process and equal protection. The trial court granted the motion to strike, declaring the live in lover portion of the Act unconstitutional when applied retroactively to an alimony judgment entered prior to the effective date of the Act. The court granted an interlocutory review of the trial court's order and reversed. The court held that the wife did not have a vested right to continue to receive full alimony from a former spouse while contemporaneously sharing living quarters and thus expenses with another albeit unmarried mate. The court ruled that the alimony judgment was not immune to modification based upon the live in lover laws and that evidence of &quot;living in&quot; was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of several counts under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1704, which prohibited the issuance of bad check in exchange for present consideration by a person who knew that the check would not be honored by the drawee. Defendant argued that the statutory presumption that notice had been received when a certified notice was returned undelivered was an irrational presumption. The court reversed defendant's convictions. The language allowing a presumption that notice had been received, whether certified notice was returned undelivered or not, was so arbitrary as to violate due process. The court also found that a bank officer's testimony was inadmissible because the trial court had excluded the bank's business records from evidence on the ground that they were not properly authenticated. Defendant's convictions were reversed because the testimony was prejudicial. The court refused to address the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence. Where an appellate court reversed a conviction on the basis that competent evidence was erroneously admitted, the court held that it did not need to review the remaining evidence on sufficiency grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During defendant's trial, he sought to discharge his court-appointed attorney and have a new one appointed. The trial court ruled that the new attorney lacked the necessary experience but allowed him to be co-counsel. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the new attorney to be substituted for the court-appointed lead counsel because it did not impair defendant's right to assistance of counsel. The court ruled that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant to act as co-counsel in his defense, as the right to self-representation was guaranteed by the state constitution, but concluded that the error was harmless due to the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. The court found that the jury list had not been revised biennially as required by statute, but that the statute was directory only and the failure did not invalidate the jury pool or deprive defendant of any of rights. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a continuance because he was not diligent in attempting to secure the presence of witnesses.</SPAN></P>

The question raised in the action of the counties was which entities were entitled to the funds collected by the commissioner but not yet distributed when the tax was held unconstitutional. The court held that the decision that the tax was unconstitutional was prospective from the date that the trial court entered its final judgment. The court found that the counties were entitled to the fruits of the holding that the tax was unconstitutional and that they were entitled to disbursement of all funds in the hands of the commissioner on that date. The court determined that the counties were not entitled to judgment against the cities for the taxes disbursed to them under the court's supersedeas of the trial court's temporary injunctions. Further, the court indicated that the counties were not entitled to any interest on the funds collected by the commissioner. The court noted that due to the prospective application of its prior decision, the question of whether the commissioner should be allowed to hold money for refunds was moot.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that armed robbery still constituted a capital felony under O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-2534.1(b)(2), and that the application of the death penalty was proper as the murder was committed during the commission of an armed robbery. The court held that the death sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The court found that the jury's findings that the offense of murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of another capital felony and that it was an aggravating circumstances were proper.</SPAN></P>

The husband answered, alleging that Georgia's alimony statutes were unconstitutional. The trial court awarded the wife temporary alimony, and the husband appealed. The husband's appeal was pending when the United States Supreme Court decided that gender-based alimony statutes were unconstitutional. The court held in the husband's prior appeal that the Georgia statutes authorizing the award of temporary alimony were unconstitutional. However, the court also held that the superior courts had the authority to award temporary alimony to either party as a derivative and incidental power to the power to grant divorces. The wife was subsequently involved in a car accident, which partially disabled her, and she filed a motion for a revision of the temporary alimony award. The husband appealed from the order revising the temporary alimony award. Again, he argued that Georgia's temporary alimony statutes were unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court was authorized to award the wife temporary alimony as a derivative and incidental power to its power to grant divorces.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and a friend escaped from a youth development center, entered a house, beat the occupant to death, and stole a car. A jury found defendant guilty of armed robbery and burglary, for which he was sentenced to life, and malice murder, for which he received a death sentence. Among the many issues on appeal, the court considered whether jury selection, jury instructions on sentencing, the dispersal of jurors without defendant's consent, and the death penalty itself resulted in reversible error. The court explained that the death penalty had been upheld against constitutional attack in both the state and federal courts. It was appropriate to screen jurors for bias and to ensure that they would apply the law. Thus, jurors opposed to the death penalty could not sit on the jury; but jurors who could apply the death penalty could serve. The superior court properly explained that jurors were required to consider both aggravating factors, such as the robbery and burglary, as well as mitigating factors in determining the sentences. The State met its burden to rebut the presumption that the dispersal of jurors during the trial did not prejudice defendant's case. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for armed robbery, burglary, and malice murder and the sentences imposed thereon, including the death sentence imposed upon defendant's conviction for malice murder.</SPAN></P>

Within the time of his probated sentence, the probationer was arrested on a fugitive's warrant in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The probationer complained that O.C.G.A. &sect; 44-404, which provided for the extradition of parole violators, was unconstitutional insofar as it was used to extradite an alleged probation violator without the demanding state's having independently alleged that a further substantial crime had been committed by that person. The court found no error. The requisition of the Governor of Wisconsin was accompanied by duly authenticated documents which showed that the probationer was convicted of burglary and placed on probation for five years; that the sentence imposed had not expired when the requisition was made; and that the demand was based on a violation by the probationer of the terms of his probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the elimination by 1978 Ga. Laws 3 of the requirement of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2001 that no conviction should be had for rape on the unsupported testimony of the female unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof on the question of guilt-innocence to the accused, that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, and that the victim's outcry after the alleged rape was not &quot;immediate&quot; and, therefore, evidence of it should not have been admitted under O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-305 as part of the res gestae. The court found that because the Georgia Legislature had determined that the uncorroborated testimony of the victim was sufficient evidence to support a rape conviction, that did not alter the fact that the burden of proving the commission of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt rested on the State. There was evidence to support the jury's verdict of guilty. The victim's outcry was communicated to witnesses immediately after the victim located them, which was within one hour after the rape occurred. The fact that the outcry was not made to the first person the victim saw after the rape did not render it inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part holding that the husband was not entitled to an interest in the marital home because he failed to rebut the statutory presumption that he had given the martial residence to the wife as a gift. The court further held, however, that the statutes under which the support orders were made had been declared unconstitutional, so the husband was entitled to a new trial on that issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had asked the reporter to investigate the allegations against him and his wife by the Department of Family &amp; Children Services who was threatening to take their children. The reporter investigated the matter and decided that there was no news story. Defendant continued to call the reporter at home even after the children had been placed in foster care, and he and his wife were indicted for 12 counts of using a telephone for the purpose of harassment. Defendant attacked the constitutionality of the telephone harassment statutes. The court affirmed the conviction. The court stated that the plain meaning of the statutes was that an individual could not make telephone calls for the purpose of harassing someone. The court found that the point was that defendant telephoned intending to harass, therefore, it did not matter what the victim's subjective ideas were on what was or was not harassing. The court held that it was harmless error to have allowed the reporter's wife's testimony of conversations between her and defendant's wife into evidence because an identification was not sufficient if identity was established only by what was said in the conversation itself.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the cigarette retailer and declared such price-fixing in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. I (1976), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-101. The trial court reasoned that the selling of cigarettes at wholesale was not &quot;affected with a public interest&quot; to the extent that the legislature could restrict individuals' constitutional right to contract. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that such price-fixing was an unconstitutional means of collecting tobacco taxes. The commissioner urged that the purpose of the minimum &quot;cost price,&quot; which required a five percent markup, was to assure that cigarette distributors remained financially healthy so that they could assist the state in collecting the cigarette stamp revenues and assist the state in properly regulating the tobacco industry. However, the court held that such purpose was repugnant to the Georgia Constitution and not a valid exercise of the state's legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the tortfeasor's motion for summary judgment, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the Act's elimination of the right to seek exemplary damages was related to the objectives of the Act to due away with collateral litigation to effect prompt payments. Further, a rational relationship existed between the elimination of exemplary damages and the classes established by the Act. Thus, the Act did not violate the victim's due process or equal protection rights. The Act was also not defective in denying the victim access to the courts and depriving him of his right to a jury trial because it was within the legislature's power to modify or abrogate common law rights of action.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed that judgment on appeal. The court reasoned that &sect; 30-201 did not violate Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VII because the statement that was in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 30-201's caption satisfied the constitutional requirement that sufficient notice of an act's provisions be provided and that the constitutional requirement that an act only refer to one subject matter was satisfied because all of &sect; 30-201's provisions related to changes in divorce and alimony procedure that the advent of &quot;no fault&quot; divorce necessitated. The court also held that &sect; 30-201 was not unconstitutionally vague because its legislative intent was clear and because the lien provision's effect was plain when the amended form of &sect; 30-201 was read in conjunction with prior state law and that an ex-husband who died before the issue of alimony was resolved were treated equally with one who did not die before that resolution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant filed suit for wrongful conversion and sought review of the order granting summary judgment for appellee and denying his motion for summary judgment. Appellant argued the Abandoned Motor Vehicles Act, 1972 Ga. Laws 342 et seq. was unconstitutional. The court found the statute did not provide that owners of abandoned motor vehicles were entitled to a judicial hearing as a matter of right on issues in controversy before their vehicles were sold. As a result, the court concluded the statute was unconstitutional as it violated the due process protections of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. I (1976). Appellee's motion for summary judgment was, thus, improperly granted. Appellant's motion for summary judgment was properly denied as there were genuine issues of material fact regarding his claims of wrongful conversion.</SPAN></P>

The ex-wife filed objections that such information was an invasion of privacy and further that such information was irrelevant and could not lead to discovery of admissible evidence. The ex-wife's allegations in support of summary judgment included an attack on the constitutionality of Ga. Code &sect; 30-220(b) (1977) which permitted alimony modification based on cohabitation. The lower court granted the ex-wife's motion for summary judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fishermen filed a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to require the Department to open certain salt water rivers and creeks to bait shrimp fishermen pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 45-908(a). The statute provided that the Department &quot;may&quot; open the rivers or creeks to bait shrimp fishing. The fishermen contended that the word &quot;may&quot; meant &quot;shall&quot; in the statute in question and that it gave them the clear legal right to have the salt waters opened for bait shrimping. The trial court held that word &quot;may&quot; indicated that the legislature intended the words to be discretionary. The court held that under O.C.G.A. &sect; 102-103, the word &quot;may&quot; was discretionary except in cases where the statute concerned the public interest or affected the right of third persons. The statute was discretionary rather than mandatory as concerning the fishermen. The public interest and the rights of third parties far outweighed the rights of the fishermen.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that &sect; 10(t) of the MARTA Act (the Act), 1965 Ga. Laws 2243, 2265, required the action to be brought in the Superior Court of Fulton County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted a motion to dismiss on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and improper venue. On appeal, the court considered whether &sect; 10(t) of the MARTA Act violated Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-4304, a provision of the Georgia Constitution that provided that an action against joint tortfeasors could be brought in the county of residence of any joint tortfeasor. The court noted that the legislature's authority was limited by constitutional restrictions and rejected an argument that Ga. Const. &sect; 2-8605 (1945), an amendment that created MARTA, relieved it of other constitutional restrictions. The court examined the MARTA Act and determined that the waivers of sovereign immunity in &sect;&sect; 8 and 22 were not conditioned on the venue provision of &sect; 10(t). The court held that the legislature had the authority to impose specific venue restrictions on suits against MARTA alone, but held that actions against MARTA as a joint tortfeasor were subject to the broader constitutional venue provision. The court held that venue in the trial court, the county of residence of the truck driver, was proper under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-4304, so that the trial court erred in its dismissal.</SPAN></P>

Laws 4558 (1975 Act). The Richmond Superior Court (Georgia) court upheld the constitutionality of the 1975 Act and granted the injunctive relief sought by the county. The water system operators sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Without complying with the 1975 Act, the water system operators increased water rates charged to certain of their residential customers. The 1975 Act provided that in all counties having a population between 145,000 and 165,000, no company providing water or sewerage services was entitled to increase their rates for such services without the prior approval of the governing authority in the county where such services were provided. Based on the 1975 Act, the county sought injunctive relief. The operators challenged the constitutionality of the 1975 Act on several grounds including the allegation that the law was a general law without uniform application throughout the state made in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, para. VII (O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-207). The superior court enjoined the operators from increasing the water rates without complying with the 1975 Act, which was found to be constitutional. The operators appealed. The court reversed, holding that the 1975 Act was unconstitutional because it had no logical basis with reference to the population classification made. As such, the superior court should have granted the operators' motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then found that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment and held that the statute was not facially overbroad nor so vague as to have violated First Amendment freedoms of assembly or speech because it sought to proscribe conduct, not free speech. The conduct, even if expressive, fell within the scope of criminal laws that reflected legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct. The state, no less than a private owner of property, had power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it was lawfully dedicated. The statute did not violative due process or equal protection guarantees because it gave fair notice to those to whom it was directed, and an actual or imminent threat of harm or disruption of operations on state property was required.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed motions to quash their accusations on the ground that Ga. Code &sect; 96-602 was unconstitutional. After hearing arguments on this motion, the trial court found the statute to be contrary to the due process clause of the Georgia Constitution because it unduly interfered with the private property right of disposing of one's property at a non-exorbitant, non-fraudulent, non-extortionate price set by him. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that by prohibiting the practice of scalping tickets, &sect; 96-602 was reasonably related to the legitimate state interest in the regulation of the resale price of tickets to places of entertainment and amusement and consequently did not violate the due process clause of either the Georgia or United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted on a conspiracy charge and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. On direct appeal, the inmate alleged that the indictment was not sufficient to place him not notice that he was being charged with conspiracy under O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-812 of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act. The appellate court refused to recognize the untimely constitutional challenge. The inmate then filed the instant petition which was dismissed on the State's contention that the inmate's failure to raise the constitutional issue at trial constituted waiver. On appeal, the court held that while the general rule was that a writ of habeas corpus could not be used as a substitute for a writ of error, the recognized exception to the general rule was where the inmate had been indicted and tried under an unconstitutional statute. The court held that in such a case, the inmate could obtain a discharge from custody on a habeas writ even after final conviction unless the issue had been reviewed and decided against the inmate in a prior proceeding. The court concluded that the inmate had not waived his right to raise his issue on habeas corpus and therefore reversed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the constitutionality of the Georgia death penalty statute had been previously upheld. The court upheld defendant's sentence of death. The jury found as statutory aggravating circumstances: (1) the offense of murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of rape and (2) the offense of murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhumane in that it involved torture or depravity of mind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The country club assessed certain fees and each of the members received a redeemable membership certificate of half the amount paid. This certificate did not appreciate, bore no interest, and could not be assigned or pledged. When a membership was terminated, the country club redeemed the membership certificate for its face value. The country club argued that these certificates were not securities. On appeal, the court reversed and rejected a mechanistic approach, which held that an instrument was a security whenever it fit the literal statutory definition because the emphasis should have been on economic reality. Assuming that the certificate was a certificate of indebtedness, it did not represent an &quot;investment&quot; within the meaning of the Securities Act. It did not meet the second element of the test for determining whether an instrument was a security because the country club's members had no expectation of profit from the certificate, but instead bought social and recreational opportunities. Those did not represent the &quot;profit&quot; with which the Securities Act was concerned. Not even under some form of the risk capital test, was the transaction a sale of a security.</SPAN></P>

At the habeas corpus hearing, the lower court received in evidence the sworn ex-parte affidavit of her court-appointed trial counsel, claiming that he did inform her of her right to an appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act allowed a county to impose a sales tax and divide it among the county and its cities, and gave a property tax rollback in areas receiving sales tax proceeds. As a result of a prior court decision finding part of the Act unconstitutional, city taxpayers received a tax reduction from both the city sales tax funds and the county portion, while other county residents received only the county portion. Taxpayers in unincorporated areas sought to prevent the counties from distributing any tax proceeds to the cities. The trial courts found the Act unconstitutional, at least in part. On the cities' appeal, the court found the Act to be unconstitutional in its entirety and void. The court ruled that allowing counties to distribute part of the tax proceeds to cities violated the Georgia Constitution because a county tax for the purpose of sharing the resulting revenue with cities was not for a valid purpose. The court found that the invalid parts of the Act were so connected with the purpose of the statute that, once they were severed, the legislative intent of the Act to provide property tax relief to municipal taxpayers was completely thwarted, and that the Act fell in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the commissioner's actions were appropriate, the tax in question was constitutional, and the taxpayer was not entitled to a jury trial in a challenge to the legality of the tax. Since the taxpayer failed to come forward with evidence disputing the correctness of the assessment, the court held that the trial court's decision was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of rape and murder after a jury trial before the Meriwether County Superior Court (Georgia); he was sentenced to death for the murder and given a life sentence for the rape. His convictions were affirmed in an earlier appeal where a new trial was ordered on the issue of punishment, and he was resentenced to death based upon aggravating circumstances. He appeared before the court on mandatory review of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On mandatory review, the court found that the court reporter's failure to transcribe all hearings on motions and all bench conferences did not render the sentence unconstitutional, that it was not error to deny his motion to remove the trial to a proper courtroom, and that it was not error to deny his request to require the investigating officer to testify as the first witness where the prosecutor stated that the testimony would be out of order. The court found that he was not prejudiced by the admission of photographs that were held admissible during his earlier appeal, that statements he made before he was in custody were admissible, and that the trial court's findings of voluntariness of his statements would be accepted unless clearly erroneous. The court ruled that there was no error in overruling his motion for a mistrial after an investigator testified that he was arrested as a result of a conversation with a co-indictee because the statement was not hearsay. The court affirmed and found no error in charging the jury concerning parties to the crime, and that the jury properly found that he was engaged in the commission of a capital felony when he murdered the victim.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion to quash and the State appealed. The court reversed the decision, holding that the section attacked was neither vague nor ambiguous; nor was it drawn in words of that could not be understood by persons of ordinary intelligence. The court concluded that defendant failed to establish by credible evidence one or more rights protected by the constitution which were violated, and as a result, the court held that defendant lacked standing to raise the rights of other persons as to whom the statute might have unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his resentencing by the Superior Court of Richmond County (Georgia), where, for the second time, a jury sentenced defendant to death for the crime of murder. Although defendant's first death sentence, which had been reversed and remanded for resentencing, was based on just one aggravating circumstance, the jury that resentenced defendant to death based the sentence on two aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in questioning the jury panel concerning their opposition to capital punishment. The court disagreed and noted that qualifying the jury protected against bias during both phases of the bifurcated trial. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in excusing a juror because of his beliefs concerning capital punishment. The court approved the trial court's refusal to admit, for the purpose of impeachment, a written report containing an alleged inconsistent statement made by a State's witness, because it was not previously made by nor signed by the witness that defendant sought to impeach. Mitigating circumstances were not required to be singled out in the charge, as defendant argued, because the trial court instructed the jury in sweeping language to consider all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including any mitigating circumstances. The court finally held that consideration by the second jury of those statutory aggravating circumstances charged but not listed by the first jury in support of defendant's death sentence, did not constitute double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's sentence to death by electrocution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer sought to enjoin the payment of any of the challenged funds and that defendants, a mayor, a city council president, and city council members, be required to reimburse the city for sums illegally paid to them. The court upheld the salary increase for the mayor because the mayor was not a member of the municipal governing authority and therefore, the authority of a city council to increase the mayor's compensation was not subject to the requirement of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 69-1019 that salary increases be implemented only following the next regular municipal election. Applying the same rationale, the court upheld the prospective salary increase for the city counsel president. The court held that that the retroactive salary increase was unconstitutional under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. VII, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-107, which prohibited the enactment of retroactive laws. The court reversed that portion of the superior court's judgment. The court declared Ordinances of the City of Atlanta, Georgia, &sect; 1-1015 unconstitutional under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 69-1019(a), (b). On remand, the superior court was instructed to enjoin the illegal payments and recoup funds already paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that portion of the judgment that upheld the increase in compensation for the mayor and the prospective increase in compensation for the president of the city council. The court reversed the retroactive compensation increase for the president of the city counsel and the expense allowance for city council members. The court remanded the case to enjoin the illegal payments and to recoup whatever past sums were illegally paid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner's automobile was towed from the operators' parking lot.

The trial court dismissed the constitutional claim and directed a verdict for the operators on the statutory violation claim. The owner appealed from the dismissal of the constitutional claim and the court affirmed. The owner's due process rights were not violated under the Georgia or United States Constitutions because there was no state action. A landowner's right to remove unauthorized vehicles from his property existed at common law before it was codified in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 85-203, and conduct for which authority was derived from the common law was not state action. The creation and enforcement of a lien on the owner's towed vehicle under Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In its motion to dismiss defendants' appeal, the City had argued that Rockmart, Ga.

The City also argued that the challenged section was unconstitutional under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-207; Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, para. VII (1976), because of the existence of a general law, Ga.

The superior court agreed with the City's position that a writ of certiorari was the exclusive method for securing review by the superior courts of decisions of inferior judicatories, such as recorders' courts. In affirming the dismissal, the court held that, under Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; IV, para. V and the predecessor of Ga.

The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred by overruling his plea in abatement, which asserted that a majority of the grand jurors who returned the indictment had unconstitutionally been held over from a previous term, noting that the statute fixing the grand jurors' terms was a general law that had properly modified a previous general law. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred by refusing to record the opening statements and arguments of counsel, noting that Ga. Code &sect; 27-2401 mandated the transcription of all felony proceedings except counsels' arguments. The court rejected defendant's contention that his character was improperly placed into evidence, agreeing with the trial court's conclusion that defendant had put his own character into question by testifying about his previous arrests. Finally, the court found that the trial court had properly denied defendant's motion for a mistrial based on objections to the district attorney's argument, noting that a review of the objections showed no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that &sect; 88-3114 did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses. According to the court, &sect; 88-3114 was carefully drawn so as to grant immunity to provides of ambulance service only for their good faith acts and omissions in rendering such emergency care.

Laws 3998, a local annexation statute for the City of Savannah, Ga., in their suits against appellees, members of the Board of Elections of Chatham County, that challenged the constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent an annexation referendum. The resident sought to intervene, arguing that the annexation would change the electoral process and dilute the voting strength of African American voters. The trial denied the request for the TRO and ruled that although there were errors in the property descriptions in the Act, the areas annexed and aldermanic districts could be ascertained. Remanding to order removal of industrial land from the districts, the court did not agree with the trial court that the industrial land not excluded from one section could remain within districts even though they had been excluded in a second section from the annexed territory. It was unclear whether the effect of the trial court's judgment was to permit the land to remain in the districts. Affirming the judgment sustaining the validity of the Act, the court did not find meritorious any ground that alleged that the annexation statute was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Whether the trial court erred in refusing to enjoin the annexation referendum was a moot question after the referendum was held.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county operated a water pollution control plant since 1961. The property owners purchased their land on the other side of the river in 1970.

The property owners sought to enjoin the noise and odors as well as further pollution of the river, which they owned to the midline. The trial court granted summary judgment for the county. The court reversed and held that the Georgia Constitution provided for a waiver of sovereign immunity where a county created a nuisance which amounted to an inverse condemnation and that no physical invasion damaging to the property need be shown, only an unlawful interference with the right of the owner to enjoy his possession. The property owners claimed that increased noise and odors resulted in an inverse condemnation of their property. Thus, the owners stated a claim of inverse condemnation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The debtors alleged that &sect; 25-306(a) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Georgia Industrial Loan Commissioner (commissioner). The court rejected this claim because the statute did not grant the commissioner unlimited authority to promulgate rules. The court found that any rules promulgated by the commissioner were required to be necessary and appropriate, and not inconsistent with the terms of the statute. However, the court agreed with the debtors that summary judgment in favor of the finance company was erroneous and thus, the court reversed the lower court's judgment. The court found that the finance company alleged that it was duly licensed under the Georgia Industrial Loan Act, and that the notes sued upon were made under the provisions of and in compliance with that act. Because the requisite licensing was not admitted by the debtors and not proven by the finance company, the court found that this issue was not resolved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board denied the business owner's application for a beer and wine license because his place of business was located within 100 yards of the school grounds of a high school. However, the business was more than 100 yards from the school building itself. The business owner contended that because the caption of O.C.G.A. &sect; 58-724.1 used the words &quot;school building or schoolhouse,&quot; the distance had to be measured from the building housing the school. Affirming the denial of the business owner's petition for a writ of mandamus, the court found that the Georgia General Assembly intended to establish an area between schools and businesses that sell beer and wine. The court held that a reasonable interpretation of legislative intent necessarily required that the 100-yard barrier apply to schools rather than buildings. The court found that the restriction of sale of beer near schools had no relationship to the building but to the occupants. Since the students may have received instructions and congregate on the school premises, the court held that it was the legislative intent that beer and wine not be sold within 100 yards of the instructional premises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of a judgment from the Cherokee Superior Court (Georgia) that convicted defendants of murdering their father, forging his paycheck, concealing his death, and tampering with the evidence. They were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and shorter sentences for the other crimes that were to have run concurrently with the life sentence. Defendants also appealed from the denial of a motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants challenged their convictions on several grounds. Affirming the convictions, the court stated that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the victim was killed with repeated blows to the head after quarreling with defendants; that a neighbor assisted defendants in disposing of the body, along with a stick and hammer, mattress, bedsprings, and a rug; that defendants signed their fathers name to his payroll check and cashed it; that defendants were found scrubbing the walls and floors of their home with ammonia; and that the autopsy revealed that the victim had died from the blows to the head before his car was set on fire and pushed over a cliff. The court held that the trial court did not err in not applying the exclusionary rule in this matter. Although the United States Supreme Court had ruled that the Georgia scheme of compensating a justice of the peace for the issuance of a search warrant, but not for failure to issue a warrant, was unconstitutional, that case had not been decided at the time of the challenged search and law enforcement officials relied in good faith on O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 24-1601, 27-303, and 27-401 for authorization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers brought suit against defendant county officials, claiming that taxes under the local option sales tax act (Act), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-3447a.1, violated Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. III. Defendant State Revenue Commissioner of Georgia (commissioner) intervened. The Superior Court of Whitfield County (Georgia) ruled that the section complained of was unconstitutional. The county officials and commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The effect of the differential rollback was that in the current fiscal year residents of the city would have received the same county maintenance and operations services as before, and the same as were received by residents of the unincorporated areas of the county, for an ad valorem property taxation rate of 12 mills. The residents of the unincorporated areas would likewise have received the same county maintenance and operations services as before, but they would have paid no ad valorem property taxes at all. Affirming the decision, the court ruled that the differential rollback of county taxes permitted by the local option sales tax act was not authorized by Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. III. The court explained that the county established a non-uniform scheme of taxation, which must be declared void. The court added that inequality among taxpayers in the same taxing authority with respect to the distribution of benefits was not unconstitutional, but discrimination in the imposition of taxes violated uniformity. The court added that when the unconstitutional provisions of the Act were removed, the remainder of the Act was sufficient to preserve the legislative scheme.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that when the state's interest in preventing flooding, halting land erosion, and protecting the water supply were weighed against the landowner's interest in constructing her tennis court, the state's interest weighed heavier in the balance. The court held that the state had engaged in valid land use regulation and had not appropriated the landowner's land for public use without compensation.

The trial court upheld &sect; 92-6413 and dismissed the taxpayer's actions. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the taxpayer lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 92-6413. Although the taxpayer alleged that &sect; 92-6413 was unconstitutional as applied to aggrieved taxpayers who filed actions prior to the tax due date and were thereby forced to pay taxes prior to their due date, the taxpayer was not so affected. The taxpayer did not file his appeals until after the taxes were in fact due. Also, although the taxpayer asserted that &sect; 92-6413 was unconstitutional because it failed to take into account the possibility of a drastic reduction in property value caused by a natural disaster or the possibility of a millage rollback, neither situation applied to the taxpayer's situation.

An adult business filed a suit for declaratory judgment against appellees, mayor and others, that the ordinance was unconstitutional on various grounds, which included violations of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Georgia and United States Constitutions, denial of the right of expression and speech, and amounted to a prior restraint. Other adult businesses intervened. The trial court upheld the validity of the ordinance. The court affirmed and held that: (1) licensing of bookstores and theatres were not a per se impairment of freedom of speech; (2) the city was not prohibited by freedom of speech or equal protection considerations from classifying adult bookstores, adult motion picture theatres, and adult entertainment establishments differently from other bookstores, theatres, or places of entertainment; and (3) the reporting and disclosure requirements were not invalid because they were the means of gathering the data necessary to investigate an applicant and detect violations of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the Commission allowed a lower rate increase. The utility filed a request for reconsideration. The Commission voted to hear oral argument, and ultimately adhered to its prior decision. The utility retroactively implemented the rate as allowed by the Commission. The consumer advocate argued that the rate increase violated the law of contracts because it was illegally retroactive. The consumer advocate also argued that the Commission's order discriminated among the utility's customers because the rate increase was permitted to take effect on different dates for different customers, thus violating the equal protection guarantees of the state and federal constitutions. Also at issue was whether the Commission had authority to require customers to pay the increased rate for service already received. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that constitutional restraints upon the impairment of the obligation of contracts did not prevent the State from exercising such powers. The court held that the Commission had statutory authority to grant a retroactive rate increase.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 92-201.7 constitutional, and held that the city's property was subject to ad valorem taxation. The city brought a complaint against defendants, tax officials and a county sheriff alleging that &sect; 92-201.7 was unconstitutional and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city alleged that: (1) it owned real property in the county, which was held for public purposes; (2) the tax commissioner informed the city that the property had been assessed for ad valorem taxes; (3) due and legal notice of the assessment had not been given and the sheriff intended to levy a tax execution on the city's property; and (4) the county officials were acting pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 92-201.7. The city contended that the exemption of 300 acres or less from the provision for taxation of public real property owned by a city outside its territorial limits was an arbitrary classification of property for taxation and that the general assembly did not have the authority to exempt some public property from taxation. The court held that there was no merit on the attack on the constitutionality to &sect; 92-201.7. The court found that the trial judge correctly found that the city was not properly notified of the assessment. The court agreed that &sect; 92.201.7 did not exempt 300 acres of a larger tract of land, and thus, the trial judge erred in directing that the tax assessors provide an exemption for 300 acres of the city's real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment except for the direction to exempt 300 acres of the property of the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Richmond County Board of Tax Assessors (Georgia), challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Richmond County (Georgia) that affirmed the decision of the Richmond County Board of Equalization (Georgia) overruling the Board's decision to disallow the deduction of the value of real estate owned by appellee taxpayer, a bank, which it acquired through mortgage foreclosure, in calculating the market value of its shares for taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that O.C.G.A &sect; 92-2406 entitled the taxpayer to deduct from the market value of its shares the value at which real estate, acquired by the taxpayer through foreclosure and not used for bank premises, was returned for ad valorem taxation. In affirming, the court explained on review that &sect; 92-2406 imposed a tax on the market value of shares of Georgia banks and of national banks located within Georgia. One provision permitted a bank to deduct from the value of the bank shares the value at which the bank's paid-for real estate was returned for taxation. The taxpayer contended that &quot;real estate&quot; included property acquired through foreclosure, while the Board wanted to limit &quot;real estate&quot; to real property used for bank premises. The court held that the statute plainly permitted a deduction of the value of paid for real estate or of a bank's equity in real estate. In the absence of limitation, the words &quot;real estate&quot; had to be given their ordinary and everyday meaning under O.C.G.A &sect; 102-102. &quot;Real estate&quot; meant land, regardless of its use or manner of acquisition. Thus, an exemption for &quot;real estate&quot; included real property acquired through foreclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After escaping from jail, defendant killed a man while robbing his son's home. The robbery occurred in one county and the killing in another. On appeal after his conviction defendant argued that he could not be tried for both crimes in the counties in which they occurred. The court found that the procedural bar of double jeopardy under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 26-506, 26-507 did not prevent counties from trying defendant for crimes that did not occur within the same jurisdiction and, thus, could not have been tried together. Defendant also argued that failure of a court reporter at trial to transcribe closing arguments of counsel, subsequently imposing the death penalty, was erroneous. The court found that the failure to make the transcription did not automatically require reversal of the death sentence and, because there was no showing of harm, reversal was not warranted in defendant's case. Though jury charges were generally not reviewable on a habeas petition, the court did review instructions and found that a curative instruction by the trial court avoided any error for an instruction given.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant persuaded a friend to help him murder his wife. He was tried by a jury and found guilty. The jury found statutory aggravating circumstances and sentenced him to death. The jury determined that the murder was committed for the purpose of receiving life insurance money, and that it was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. The court held that: (1) the trial court properly excused prospective jurors who indicated they would not vote for the death penalty; (2) an agent's testimony did not infringe upon defendant constitutionally protected right to remain silent; (3) the accomplice's testimony was amply corroborated in several particulars; and (4) the death sentence was not imposed under the improper influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The evidence supported the jury's findings in regard to the statutory aggravating circumstances. The sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases considering both the crime and the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former husband sought review of a judgment entered by the Superior Court of Putnam County (Georgia), which dismissed his complaint seeking a modification of a previous award of permanent alimony to appellee former wife. The wife filed a cross-appeal from that judgment to the extent that it found that 1977 Ga. Laws 1253-1255 was applicable to the parties' divorce decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties divorced in 1975. Their separation agreement provided that its terms, including the ones addressing alimony, could not be modified without their written consent. That provision was not incorporated into the divorce decree. The husband sought a modification of the alimony award after the wife obtained employment. The trial court found that his complaint was barred by the separation agreement and dismissed it. It also found that 1977 Ga. Laws 1253-1255, which authorized the husband's action, applied to the divorce decree. Both parties sought review of the trial court's judgment, which was affirmed. The court found that the trial court erred when it relied on the separation agreement because its modification provision was superceded by the divorce decree. However, the trial court's judgment was affirmed because 1977 Ga. Laws 1253-1255 could not be applied retroactively. While S.B. 581, Gen. Assem. (Ga. 1978) gave retroactive effect to that provision, the court stated that such effect ignored the vested rights of litigants with regard to judgments that could not be otherwise modified and, therefore, violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, para. 7 and O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-107.</SPAN></P>

There was no requirement that defendant be present during the search. The court held that the failure to furnish defendant an inventory did not affect the validity of the search and seizure. The court ruled that the motive for the search was irrelevant because the search was authorized and was required by &sect; 27-302 and &sect; 27-301. The court held that there was no evidence presented by defendant to show that the police officer who tested the shotgun, altered or tampered with it, or used unconventional shells in firing it. The state prima facie carried its burden of proof by introducing into evidence the shotgun itself, which was the best evidence of its size.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The students alleged that the commuter student rule impinged on their rights to free association, free travel, privacy, and equal protection. The court rejected this argument summarily, finding that the college had an inherent right to promulgate and enforce reasonable rules and regulations, which impaired a student's perfect freedom to do as he pleases. The court also rejected the students' arguments that the male-only military training requirement constituted invidious sex discrimination because sex was not an inherent suspect classification. The students also alleged a cause of action under 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1681(a), the federal non-discrimination statute. The court also rejected this argument because the statute did not provide for a private right of action against a college or its officials. Finally, the court affirmed the trial court's refusal to issue a preliminary injunction because the students had failed to show any significant injury that would have resulted from their compliance with the college's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband attacked the constitutionality of garnishments in general, alleged that he was denied procedural due process, and argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the determination of unpaid support. He also alleged that the wife waived her right to collect child support arrearages that were due under a temporary alimony order, for she executed a separation agreement which contained a release and discharge of all claims against him. The court affirmed the judgment of garnishment. The husband was provided procedural due process when the state court approved the affidavit for garnishment before the summons of garnishment issued, and by the fact that he received timely notice of the garnishment and an early hearing on his traverse. The court found that the wife had no power to waive the child's right to child support, so the separation agreement's release provision had no effect on collection of the child support arrearage.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner entered into a contract with a development corporation to build a shopping center on the land. Before construction began, the property owner secured a construction loan that allowed periodic withdrawals for necessary payments so long as the property remained free of liens and encumbrances. The construction company provided materials for use on the property, and the construction company filed a materialmen's lien after it was not paid. The property owner argued that the construction company was not a materialman, that &sect; 67-2002 was unconstitutional, and that the construction company should have been restrained from continuing the lien on the property. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which was in favor of the construction company. The court determined that &sect; 67-2002 was constitutional; therefore, the trial court properly refused to enjoin the construction company from maintaining the lien. The statute did not deprive the property owner of a significant property interest without notice and a hearing. Although some use of the property might have been curtailed, the property owner was not prevented from managing his property as he chose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An illegitimate child died in an automobile accident involving the motorist. The child's father brought a wrongful death action against the motorist. The motorist filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that Ga.

The superior court entered an order denying the motion and held that the statute violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court reversed the order. The court held that (1) &sect; 105-1307 was not unconstitutional because its classification distinguishing between the parents of illegitimate children was rationally related to legitimate legislative aims, including the state's interest in encouraging fathers of illegitimate children to legitimate the child by petition or by marrying the mother; and (2) it was constitutionally permissible for the state legislature to attack a perceived evil only a little at a time, and the legislature chose to amend &sect; 105-1307 without allowing the father of an illegitimate child to bring a wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. In reaching its decision, the court held that &sect; 92-8316 set a reasonable limitation on the right to redeem property under a tax deed executed seven years prior to its passage, and that the section did not impair vested rights in violation of the state and federal constitutional prohibition against the passage of retroactive or ex post facto laws. The court further held that the determination that &sect; 92-8316 was valid made it unnecessary to consider the claimants' contentions concerning the invalidity of the tax sale. According to the court, the property to which the claimants' asserted a right to redeem was sold as the property of their predecessor in title, and title under the tax deed had ripened under &sect; 92-8316 prior to their deed from their predecessor in title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for kidnapping, armed robberies, aggravated assault and sentenced to imprisonment, death and life imprisonment. He appealed. The court held that: (1) a prospective juror was properly excused for cause because he could not vote to impose the death penalty; (2) leading questions were proper under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 38-1706 because the witness failed to testify to the facts in question; (3) the admission of defendant's statements were proper as res gestae under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 38-305; and (4) the admission of evidence was not a violation of the Brady rule because defendant failed to show that he was denied a fair trial because the evidence had been withheld from him. Defendant also appealed his murder conviction and its death sentence. The court held that: (1) the denial of the plea of former jeopardy was proper because murder and kidnapping were not included offenses under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-505(b); (2) the jury could reject insanity plea; and (3) the death sentence was supported by aggravating circumstances and was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases under Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parties sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Lowndes County (Georgia), which found that the applicable statute of limitation was O.C.G.A. &sect; 89-832, limiting the recovery of cross-appellant Commissioners of the Judges of Probate Courts Retirement Fund of Georgia against appellants, the judge and his sureties, in an a complaint for money judgment regarding the judge's contribution to a retirement fund.</SPAN></P>

The judge and the sureties urged in defense that the statute was unconstitutional and that a portion of the action was barred by the statute of limitation. Based upon stipulations of fact, the trial court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-1708a was not unconstitutional under Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; II, para. I, Further, the trial court found that the applicable statute of limitation was O.C.G.A. &sect; 89-832 rather than O.C.G.A. &sect; 3-704 and, therefore, the board's recovery against the judge and his sureties was limited. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because the constitutional infirmities existing in the prior version of O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-1708a were not present in the version at issue, there was no need to overturn the trial court's decision on appeal. As to the cross-appeal, arguing that the wrong statute of limitations had been applied, the court held that because the statute cited by the trial court specifically dealt with the issue at hand, it was the proper section.</SPAN></P>

Both convictions could not be upheld. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences of death and kidnapping with bodily injury of the younger girl.

The three cases were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A board of tax assessors proposed an ad valorem tax digest for the county, which was approved by the state revenue commissioner. The trial court issued an order allowing taxes to be collected on a temporary basis under the proposed tax digest, subject to later adjustment. Taxpayers filed a class action, seeking to set aside the proposed tax digest. In three separate orders, the trial court denied their request. The court affirmed. The taxpayers' request to enjoin the approval of the local tax digest and the temporary collection of taxes under the digest was moot because these events had already occurred and because no supersedeas had been obtained from the trial court's orders refusing to enjoin these events. The taxpayers had an adequate remedy at law through their appeals to the county board of tax equalization. The court rejected the taxpayers' argument that the board's failure to hold a hearing within the time provided by law deprived them of an adequate remedy at law. Assuming this was true, the proper remedy was a writ of mandamus to require the board to hold a hearing. Once the board rendered its decision, the taxpayers could file a de novo appeal to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance that required workers on city funded construction projects in excess of $ 10,000 to be paid a minimum wage which corresponded to the prevailing wage scale prescribed by the federal Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C.S. &sect; 276(a) et seq.

The case was before the court on mandatory review of the death sentence imposed. The court affirmed. The court held that the Georgia Capital Punishment Statute was constitutional. The granting or denial of a motion for appointment of expert witnesses lay within the sound discretion of the trial court. After the State proved a conspiracy, declarations by any conspirator during the pendency of the criminal project were admissible against all pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 38-306. During the sentencing determination, the jury was not limited to matter presented during the sentencing phase of the trial, but was entitled to consider any matter presented during the case in chief. The death penalty for rape was not unconstitutional where the victim was killed. The sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The evidence supported the jury's findings of statutory aggravating circumstances, and the sentence of death was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and defendant, as required by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2537(c)(1-3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, Housing Authority of Fulton County, Georgia (FHA), a planning director, and county commissioners, sought review of a judgment by the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which denied injunctive relief against appellee Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta, Georgia (AHA). The AHA sought a building permit to renovate an apartment complex that was less than 10 miles outside of the City of Atlanta, but within unincorporated Fulton County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was whether the AHA, as a city housing authority, had the power to establish housing projects within a 10-mile radius of the city limits, or whether that rested with the FHA, as a county housing authority. The confusion was the result of the historical development of the Housing Authorities Law, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 99-1101 et seq. In Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 99-1103(f), a city housing authority was permitted to operate within a 10-mile radius outside of its boundaries. This power overlapped with the definition of a county housing authority's area of operation in Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 99-1146. However, a 1972 constitutional amendment, 1972 Ga. Laws 1552, provided that no city or county housing authority could exercise public housing powers or provide such services inside the boundaries of any other local governments except by contract. The court held that the 1972 amendment mandated that the superior court's judgment be vacated. Under the amendment, the AHA had no authority to exercise public housing powers with Fulton County in the absence of a contract or unless otherwise provided by a local or special law. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Laws 1164, placed unconstitutional restrictions on the right to operate bingo games. The nonprofit organizations challenged the constitutionality of additional sections under the Act. Appellee revenue department cross-appealed the rulings of invalidity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The nonprofit organizations sponsored bingo games through the services of a for-profit corporation.

The court held that: (1) none of the nonprofit organizations had standing to challenge certain licensure provisions of the Act where they had not applied for licenses in certain instances and where they were in existence more than two years insofar as the Act imposed a limitation on licenses to organizations in existence fewer than two years; (2) Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-211 (the bingo amendment), although prohibiting the legislature from outlawing bingo, did not preclude the regulation of bingo; (3) the license requirement of the Act and the imposition of a filing fee were not invalid; (4) the Act's restrictions on the participation of minors in bingo games was proper; and (5) restrictions on the rental of premises from or sponsorship through for-profit organizations were proper.</SPAN></P>

Defendant knew that the fence was prohibited, but erected it in disregard of the ordinance. The court reversed the judgment reversing defendant's conviction. The act of a city exercising zoning power could only be disturbed if it was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. It was not sufficient for defendant, who had the burden to prove that the ordinance was arbitrary, to show that he could more profitably use the property or that his use of the property would not cause injury to the public. The ordinance did not deny defendant the right to protect the lives of his family or property, because there was no evidence that wooden fences, which were allowed, were inadequate for security purposes. The city had broad power under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 69-1207 to regulate property and other structures within its boundary. Testimony that chain link fences caused injuries to persons, and that it was easier for firefighters to gain access through wood rather than chain fences, tended to show that the ordinance promoted the safety and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

The State cross-appealed the trial court's ruling that after the initial issuance of an arrest warrant, a justice of the peace could not constitutionally hold preliminary commitment hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both defendants were arrested on criminal warrants issued by a justice of the peace. Defendants argued that the entire justice of the peace system was unconstitutional because there was no state or federal constitutional or statutory requirement that a justice of the peace be a member of the bar or that he be employed on salary. The court held that there was nothing inherently constitutional in a fee system. Furthermore, the system as implemented was constitutional because a justice of the peace received the same remuneration whether he acted positively or negatively. Typographical errors on the warrant did not render the warrant fatally defective; therefore, the trial court properly denied defendants' motions to defense. In regard to the State's cross-appeal, the court held that a justice of the peace was able to hold a preliminary commitment hearing even if he had issued the arrest warrant. The system provided no monetary incentive to a justice of the peace that potentially harmed defendants in any fashion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A magistrate issued a warrant authorizing the search of defendants' residence. An assortment of illegal drugs was seized. Defendants were indicted and filed a motion to suppress complaining that the Magistrates Act, 1974 Ga. Laws 2212, was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion and the State sought review. On appeal, the court held that (1) the trial erred in finding that the notice of intention appended to the act failed to satisfy the notice requirement found in O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-1309, and the notice was sufficient in that it informed the citizens of the broad range of legislative enactment; (2) the act was not in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-3801 because that provision exempted state courts from its operation; (3) the trial court erred in finding that the magistrate was not neutral and detached as the alter ego of the state court judge; (4) the provision of the Act making the magistrate appointable by the state court judges did not improperly delegate legislative authority; and (5) that section of the Act giving the magistrate authority to try cases involving violations of ordinances and state traffic laws did not constitute an improper delegation of judicial authority.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sued for the right to receive survivorship benefits under the no-fault provisions of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-3403b(b) (1975), but appellee was granted summary judgment. On appeal, the court noted that the statute expressly permitted surviving spouses and children to receive payments after the death of their insured as though the deceased were alive but totally disabled. The statute did not provide that survivorship benefits be paid to individuals, such as appellants, who were similarly situated to surviving spouses and children. The statute did not violate the due process or equal protection guarantees of the United States and Georgia constitutions, for its classification was rationally calculated to provide benefits for persons most likely to suffer from an insured's death while deterring litigation to determine whether others should also benefit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Clarke County Superior Court (Georgia), which after a jury trial convicted her of murder and sentenced her to life imprisonment. She claimed that it was error to impermissibly shift the burden of proving provocation to her, to deny a motion for new trial based upon allegedly newly discovered evidence, to refuse to dismiss for failure to grant a speedy trial, and to imply malice under O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant quarreled loudly with the victim, a man she lived with, at their house. The quarrel attracted the attention of his mother and sister who lived nearby. The sister threatened her with a butcher knife. Defendant removed a gun from a car outside the house, and shot it in the air to frighten the victim. She then shot him and soon thereafter stated to his family that she shot him and would shoot him again. At trial, she claimed that they had been smoking drugs, she was grabbed by the victim, and did not know how he had been shot. On review, the court found that the jury had been charged directly from the text of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1101(a) on murder, that the charge did not shift the burden of proof on malice to her, and that a charge on circumstantial evidence was an accurate statement of the law. The court found that a report from a crime laboratory of a test was not newly discovered evidence but was merely cumulative of existing evidence on the gunshot wounds, that she could not complain of a denial of a speedy trial because she had never asked for a speedy trial and was free on bond through trial, and that there was no issue of provocation in the case.</SPAN></P>

Under the ordinance, the city's five electoral districts were broadened to encompass the annexed territory. The residents asserted that the local Act was unconstitutional because it did not make provision for including the annexed territory within the city council electoral districts or for creating a new electoral district. The court affirmed, upholding both the local Act and the ordinance. There was no requirement that the local Act make provision for the changes in electoral districts that the annexation necessitated. And the ordinance was properly enacted pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 69-1017(b)(1), which established the proper method for amending a city charter without intervention by the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff injured party challenged the decision of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which granted summary partial summary judgment to defendant blood supplier in a strict liability action brought under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 105-106 alleging in part that he received unwholesome and defective units of blood products manufactured and sold by the supplier that caused him to suffer physical and mental diseases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supplier asserted that under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 105-1105 the supply of blood and blood products was a service rather than a sale. The court agreed with the supplier that the language of &sect; 105-1105 clearly indicated that the supplying of blood was a service. Therefore, &sect; 105-106 did not apply, and the court held that the injured party was required to show negligence. Therefore, the court held that partial summary judgment on the injured party's strict liability claim was proper. The injured party argued that exempting blood suppliers from the strict liability provision of &sect; 105-106 was a special law contrary to general law, and as such violated the Ga. Const. art. I., &sect; 2, para. VIII, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that the legislature's reasoning in protecting carefully operated blood suppliers was not arbitrary, and was not special legislation contrary to the state constitution. The court also found that the injured party's rights of national citizenship were not abridged by &sect; 105-106. Therefore, the court found &sect; 105-106 was constitutional, and upheld the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised several challenges to his convictions. The court found that defendant's conviction for armed robbery had to be reversed because defendant could not legally be convicted and sentenced for both a felony murder and the lesser-included felony on which that felony murder conviction was based. The court determined that the trial court did not err in overruling a motion to suppress a statement made by defendant during custodial interrogation and that the court did not err in overruling defendant's objections to admission of his taped statement. The court determined that defendant failed to show how, if at all, a delay in appointment of counsel deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. The court found that the trial court did not err when it allowed defendant's common law wife to testify, voluntarily, against him. Finally, the court determined that the death sentences imposed on defendant were not imposed as the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; were supported by evidence of aggravating circumstances; and were not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had entered a guilty plea to burglary, and she received a two-year sentence, to be probated upon payment of a fine. When the inmate was unable to pay the entire amount and was incarcerated, she sought habeas corpus. On review, the court found that her petition was properly denied. The court indicated that it was not unconstitutional, particularly under the facts of the case, for a condition of probation to include the immediate payment of a fine. The court noted that the sentence being challenged was based on a representation that a fine could be paid. Thus, the inmate could not now contradict such representations in order to claim that she was unlawfully incarcerated. As a result, the inmate was not suffering from disparate treatment based solely on wealth. She never claimed to be indigent and unequivocally informed the trial court that she was able to pay a fine. It was on such a basis that the trial court framed its sentence. Thus, the inmate would not be allowed to mislead the trial court as to ability to pay a fine, thus inducing an alternate sentence, and later seek to rely upon constitutional safeguards to avoid punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a condition of his employment as a police patrol officer, an applicant had to comply with the terms of a city ordinance, which required him to become and to remain a resident of the city.

Code Ann. &sect; 89-950, a general statute, and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 4(1) (1945). The trial court found that the residency requirement violated Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 89-950. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the case presented a justiciable controversy because the right to choose a particular profession was an important right, and the applicant had a right to have a determination of whether the ordinance preventing him from being considered for employment was unconstitutional; (2) the ordinance, in providing residential requirements for officers and employees of the police and fire bureaus, was in contravention of &sect; 89-950; and (3) hence, the ordinance was void under Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Georgia's post-judgment garnishment law was previously struck down as unconstitutional because there was a lack of initial judicial supervision and it failed to provide for notice and an opportunity for an early preliminary hearing after the deprivation of property. Thereafter, the law was completely revised, however, it was still found to be constitutionally inadequate. The law was then struck in its entirety and a new code section was created that provided for extensive judicial supervision. The garnishee challenged the constitutionality of Georgia's post judgment garnishment law. On appeal, the court found that Georgia's post-judgment garnishment procedures under Title 46 of the Georgia Code were constitutional. The court stated that a new code section was added, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 46-105, that required a plaintiff to give notice to a judgment defendant, following the filing of the summons of garnishment. The court noted that &sect; 46-105 was extensive and provided adequate notice to a judgment defendant that a garnishment proceeding had been filed. The court concluded that the imperfections in the previous post-judgment garnishment law had been cured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that had denied the garnishee's motion to dismiss a summons of garnishment.</SPAN></P>

Laws 128. The citizen contended the trial court erred in holding that a prior federal court litigation was res judicata of the state due process and eminent domain grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This suit arose when defendant city issued a stop work order claiming that plaintiff citizen's plan to build a tennis court on her property violated the Metropolitan River Protection Act (Act), 1973 Ga. Laws 128. The citizen brought suit in federal court claiming the Act was unconstitutional. That case was dismissed, then the citizen filed suit in state court asserting state constitutional grounds. The trial court ruled the state due process and eminent domain grounds were barred by res judicata by litigation of the federal due process grounds in the federal court. On review, the citizen argued the trial court's ruling was erroneous. The appeals court agreed that the trial court erred in holding that the federal court litigation was res judicata of the state due process and eminent domain grounds. The court reasoned that the construction of similar federal constitutional provisions, though persuasive authority, was not binding on Georgia's construction of its own Constitution. And since the state issues in the case substantially predominated and most likely would have been left for state resolution had they been presented to the federal court, they were not barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court reversed the judgment dismissing the citizen's state law claims as barred by res judicata because the federal court would have likely refrained from exercising its pendent jurisdiction over the state claims in the prior action between the parties.</SPAN></P>

There was no general law that designated the grand juries of the state as arbitrators in disputes involving the number and salaries of deputy sheriffs or the sheriff's fiscal budget.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court ruled that the agency had not complied with the necessary procedure for coming under the jurisdiction of the board in that the requisite number of employees of the agency had not signed a petition requesting an election. On review, the court reversed. When a petition of the electors was required to call a special election, the sufficiency of the petition was generally not subject to collateral attack after the election was held. The sufficiency of the petition requesting a civil service election should not have been subject to collateral attack, as the election itself had already been held and not been shown to be in any other respect unfair or in violation of law. Those persons employed by the agency could have come under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service System if the requisite number of them so chose. The agency personnel remained under the jurisdiction of the Civil Service System after the agency separated from Court Administration. There was no reason why the departmental reclassification automatically resulted in the employees of the department being denied coverage when they had previously decided by unanimous vote to come under the board.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that defendant's Miranda rights were not violated because he was advised of his right to an attorney on three separate occasions before he signed an inculpatory statement. The court ruled that an affidavit containing inaccuracies did not invalidate a search warrant because the inaccuracies were not intentional, and they were of peripheral relevancy to the showing of probable cause. The court determined that testimony that placed defendant's character in issue was cured by the trial court's instructions to the jury. The court held that the trial court properly excluded the deposition of an unavailable witness pursuant to Ga.

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion: (1) in failing to excuse two jurors for cause, which did not prejudice defendant by requiring him to utilize peremptory strikes; (2) in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial because the trial court instructed the jury to ignore an inflammatory closing remark by the prosecutor; (3) in denying defendant's motion for funds to employ experts that were not essential to his defense; and (4) in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue because the jurors selected did not form fixed opinions as to guilt or innocence from unfavorable pre-trial publicity. The court also held that (a) the trial court properly instructed the jury on the state's burden of proving malice as defined by Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions for two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping, which were entered by the Superior Court of Greene County (Georgia). Defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence his pretrial statements given to law enforcement officials, and that the kidnapping statute, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1311, was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed kidnapping with bodily injury to be punished by death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for two murders and kidnapping, and received a sentence of death on each count. The evidence showed that defendant beat his brother to death after a fight ensued, because of defendant's attempt to have sex with his brother's girlfriend. Defendant then beat to death another person living in the house in an attempt to cover up the first murder and the rape and kidnapping of the victim. Defendant contended the superior court committed several reversible errors and argued his sentence was excessive. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and concluded that defendant's pretrial statements to the police were made after defendant had been advised of his right to have an attorney present and that he had knowingly and voluntarily relinquished that right. The court set aside defendant's sentence of death received under the indictment for kidnapping and remanded with directions that defendant be resentenced to life imprisonment, the only permissible punishment under the kidnapping statute. The court held that the sentence of death for the murders was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases considering both the crimes and defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his rape, kidnapping, and armed robbery conviction to the court under the Georgia Constitution. The court, upon its own motion, determined that the general assembly's passage of 1977 Ga. Laws 299 (Act) required examination and a preliminary ruling upon the court's jurisdiction before the consideration of the merits of the appeal. The court found that the Act had been an attempt to reverse the jurisdiction of the court, as originally supplied by Ga. Const. of 1976, art. VI, &sect; II, para. IV, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3104, and the appellate court, as supplied by the Georgia Constitution at Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3108. Because the supreme court had jurisdiction over all capital offenses, an initial determination that the death penalty was no longer a valid sentence over the criminal appeals transferred to the appellate court was required. The jurisdiction of the appellate court was properly amended by the Act. However, the general assembly lacked the authority to enlarge the jurisdiction of the court, and therefore, that portion of the Act was unconstitutional. The court transferred defendant's appeal because under the Act the appellate court had been given jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners conveyed the site of their home to the department after they learned that a highway would be built upon it. After the plans for the highway were cancelled, the landowners sought to cancel the deed. In protracted litigation, they filed equitable counterclaims against the department and argued that the deed was void under theories of mistake, abandonment, duress, misrepresentation, and fraud. The superior court dismissed the counterclaims. On the landowners' appeal, the court held that the theory of mistake was not applicable because it applied only to past or present facts; the highway was indisputably scheduled to be built at the time of the conveyance. Nor was the department's decision to abandon the highway project equivalent to abandonment of the land, which it now owned in fee simple. The equitable claims of duress and fraud were barred by the seven year statute of limitations. An action for misrepresentation in law was not actionable in equity; the landowners' failure to investigate the facts foreclosed their claim for misrepresentation of fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee franchisor granted a franchise to the competitor for the sale of its trucks in a territory also granted to the truck dealer. The truck dealer filed an objection with the commission under the Motor Vehicles Franchise Practices Act of 1974 (1974 Act), Ga. Code Ann. ch. 84-66 (1974). Before the commission entered an order, the 1974 Act was repealed by the Motor Vehicle Farm Machinery Practices Act of 1976 (1976 Act), Ga. Code Ann. ch. 84-66 (1976). The commission concluded that the 1974 Act had not been substantially repealed, and denied a license to the competitor. The superior court reversed and found that the 1974 Act had been repealed and that portions of the 1976 Act were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgement below in part and reversed in part. The court held that: (1) the 1974 Act was repealed by the 1976 Act; (2) the commission membership under the 1976 Act was not unconstitutional; and (3) the 1976 Act was unconstitutional because the limit on the number of dealers to which the franchisor could market was an undue burden on interstate commerce and the legislature could not use its power to protect a special group from competition.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed that portion of the judgement below which held that the composition of the commission under the 1976 Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 114-414 unconstitutional in a workmen's compensation action by appellee children to exclude the deceased's stepchildren from a share of the benefits to dependents accruing because of his death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deceased died while in the employ of the employer. The children brought a workmen's compensation action alleging that the conclusive presumption of the dependency of stepchildren in O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-414 was unconstitutional, denying them due process of law and equal protection of the laws. The trial court declared O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-414 unconstitutional, and the employer and the carrier appealed. The court ruled that workmen's compensation was a creature of statute, and that the beneficiaries of the death benefits of a deceased employee did not purport to be determined by the obligations the employee had to the beneficiaries. Further, the court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-414 designated children holding certain relationships to the deceased as dependents as a matter of law so as to qualify them as beneficiaries under the Workmen's Compensation law. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that the legislature had a constitutional right to designate the children in the classes specified in O.C.G.A. &sect; 114-414 as beneficiaries of a deceased employee, and that the section was not unconstitutional as legislating the truth of facts.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the requirements for making out a prima facie case for discrimination were two-fold: first, the appellant must prove that an opportunity for discrimination existed from the source of the jury list, and, second, that the use of that infected source produced a significant disparity between the percentages found present in the source and those actually appearing on the grand and traverse jury panels. The court reversed the judgment denying defendant's motion challenging the composition of the juries, concluding that defendant showed that a significant disparity existed between the source, the community, and the actual jury lists, and that the juries were illegally constituted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After appellant's convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, he sought a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court denied his motion for an evidentiary hearing on the issues related to the constitutionality of the death penalty and Georgia's review procedures in death penalty cases. Appellant contended that the denial of the hearing violated the Georgia Habeas Corpus Act and deprived him of due process and effective assistance of counsel. In affirming the trial court's decision to deny the petition, the court determined that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's request for a hearing. The trial court denied oral testimony that was offered solely to support the findings of documents, studies, and surveys proffered as evidence. Moreover, an evidentiary hearing was not necessary on the issues that were previously decided adversely to appellant. Appellant had no legal basis for asserting his contentions regarding voir dire during the post-conviction relief procedures. The issues should have been resolved during voir dire. Finally, appellant should have offered his mitigation witnesses during the sentencing portion of his bifurcated trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-1106, the tax collector was entitled to a commission for collecting school taxes, which was to be paid over to the proper fiscal authorities if the collector was on a salary basis.

The lower court found for the board of education, but the court reversed. The court rejected the board of education's argument that the cost of collecting the educational funds was not &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; to public education because the tax commissioner was on a salary basis of compensation. A ruling that the commissions were only &quot;necessary and incidental&quot; when the tax commissioner was compensated on a fee basis would be totally inconsistent with &sect; 32-1106.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was connected to the crimes by items that he stole, by a fingerprint, and by statements that he made to his friends. The trial court convicted defendant of three counts of murder and sentenced him to death for each count. Defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in failing to grant a pre-trial motion for change of venue, in failing and refusing to give defendant's requested jury charge on intoxication, and in failing to command the jury to render a unanimous verdict following the trial's sentencing phase. The court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a change of venue based on pre-trial publicity because the jurors did not have preconceived opinions as to defendant's guilt or innocence and there was a large period of time between the media coverage and the trial. Defendant's request for a jury instruction on intoxication was properly denied because it was untimely. The jurors' reservations to imposing the death penalty did not prevent their verdicts from being unanimous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board denied the owner's application for a variance to use his property as a meatpacking and animal slaughtering operation. The area zoned heavy industry and prohibited the slaughtering of animals within 300 feet of a residential zone. Instead of appealing from this adverse decision, the owner filed an independent suit in equity against the county for declaratory and injunctive relief. Residents of the neighborhood in which the owner's property was located intervened. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and submitted the other issues involving factual disputes to a jury, which rendered a verdict adverse to the owner. On appeal from the judgment rendered thereon, the court noted that Augusta and Richmond County, Ga., Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance &sect; 32-9 (1969) provided an adequate remedy for an aggrieved person to appeal from an adverse Board decision. Because he was not attacking the ordinance as written or the underlying statute upon which it was based, the court noted that the owner should have pursued his right of appeal under the ordinance. The court also concluded that the ordinance was not unconstitutional as applied to the property.</SPAN></P>

The electric company filed a counterclaim contending that the Act was unconstitutional, void, and unenforceable. The trial court declared the Act inoperative and void for uncertainty and indefiniteness in meaning and dismissed counsel's action. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. The court held that the Georgia General Assembly had the authority to provide for such an advocate to challenge actions taken by the commission so long as the legislation was not unconstitutional. The Act contained sufficient information to ascertain the authority, duties, and responsibilities of counsel so as to give fair notice to everyone concerned with the Act of the nature of counsel's position. Although counsel was given discretion in choosing which matters to pursue, such discretionary decisions, which were not unlike those faced by other governmental entities, did not make the Act void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he was convicted by the recorder's court of public drunkenness and disorderly conduct, petitioner was sentenced to 60 days in jail. He filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, in which he alleged that the recorder's relation with the city attorney was prejudicial, that he had been entitled to counsel, and that the ordinance under which he had been arrested was unconstitutional. The recorder filed a general denial and a motion to dismiss, which was granted and affirmed on appeal. The rationale for dismissal was that petitioner had not filed a traverse to the recorder's answer, which made the answer conclusive as to the facts. On appeal, the court explained that amendments to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-302 now set forth the procedure for traversing an answer but did not require it. This answer merely denied the allegations of the petition and was insufficient. Petitioner could require the recorder to set forth his own recitals of fact, to which petitioner could file a traverse. Although the conflict of interest and constitutionality issues were meritless, the right to counsel argument was justiciable.

The court affirmed the trial court's order enjoining the county commissioners from enforcing the adult movie provision of the ordinance. The ordinance was not intended to regulate or control the dissemination of obscene materials, but dealt exclusively with films that were not obscene. Thus, the ordinance was an attempt to regulate materials which were a form of expression fully protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, the ordinance imposed an invalid prior restraint on the freedom of speech and was a violation of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant witness sought review of a judgment of the Cherokee Superior Court (Georgia), which held him in contempt of court pursuant to Georgia's Immunity From Prosecution Statute, Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 38-1715, 38-1716.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered an order requiring the witness to give testimony in a criminal case in which he was allegedly involved. Paragraph 3 of the order directed that the witness &quot;not be required to produce evidence that could be used in any other courts against himself.&quot; The witness, on advice of counsel, refused to testify as ordered on the ground that the trial court's order did not provide him with &quot;use and derivative use&quot; immunity. The court vacated the judgment of the trial court holding the witness in contempt. The court determined that it was the intention of the legislature to grant &quot;use and derivative use&quot; immunity under the statute. The court found that the compelled evidence or any other evidence derived from the compelled evidence could not be used against the witness in proceedings in any other forum. The court concluded that with such an interpretation placed upon the statute, it was not unconstitutional as violative of the Fifth Amendment as contended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment and remanded with direction for deletion of paragraph 3 of the trial court's order and for proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction for distribution of obscene material that was issued by the Fulton Criminal Court (Georgia), following a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The arresting officer went into defendant's adult book store where defendant sold him a certain magazine and an artificial vagina. Other devices were in plain view in glass display cases. The arresting officer arrested defendant for distribution of obscene materials. The trial court convicted defendant of distribution of obscene materials, and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: 1) Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2101(c) was not unconstitutional for vagueness and overbreadth because the 1975 amendment to &sect; 26-2101(c), 1975 Ga. Laws 498, simply defined in more definite terms what had been previously referred to as &quot;material,&quot; and made no substantive change so as to require a new determination as to the constitutional issues of vagueness and overbreadth; 2) the trial court did not err where it overruled defendant's motion to suppress because the evidence seized was displayed in a glass case in plain view; 3) the evidence supported the verdict; 4) neither 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1461 nor the Constitution required proof of defendant's knowledge of the legal status of the materials; and 5) obscene material did not come within the protection of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
