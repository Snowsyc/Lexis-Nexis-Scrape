Defendant challenged his conviction for perjury. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 32-2(b) (1967), which relieved the prosecution of the burden of proving which statement was false in a case involving contradictory statements, did not create an unconstitutional presumption of guilt because proof that a person made contradictory statements proves of itself, without aid of any presumption, that the person made a false statement. The court also found that the failure to warn defendant that his contradictory statements could be used to convict him did not preclude a conviction for perjury. The court found that there were insufficient facts in the record to determine if an acquittal in defendant's first trial on the count of conspiracy to commit perjury precluded conviction in the second trial for perjury. The court also found that whether the immunity waiver signed by defendant before testifying at the grand jury was void because he was compelled to sign was irrelevant because his privilege against self-incrimination did not apply to testifying falsely.</SPAN></P>

The prohibition of the constitution was that one municipality could not force another to levy taxes to pay a debt which id did not incur or for the corporate purpose of the other municipality. The effect of &sect; 36.6 was that the taxpayers living in the townships could have paid their taxes to the township collectors and diverted those funds to the specialized purposes of the townships even though those taxes had been levied for the different corporate purposes of the county-wide taxing bodies.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), sitting in equity, entered judgment against the company. The company appealed directly to the court because the constitutionality of Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Equity jurisdiction authorized the circuit court to appoint a receiver to take over municipal buildings for rehabilitation. The receiver's predecessor was appointed with regard to certain property, and was authorized under Ill. Stat. Rev. ch. 24, para. 11-31-2 (1967) to issue certificates, which were to be purchased by the title and trust company. The certificates were to be a first lien on the property and its rents, superior to all prior existing liens and encumbrances. The company refused to purchase the certificates and the receiver's predecessor filed suit for specific performance. The company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was denied. After the company failed to proceed further the circuit court entered judgment against it. The company appealed and asserted that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order of specific performance. It held that the statute did not violate the United States Constitution's contract clause and that it was a reasonable and legitimate exercise of the state's police power. It held that the extension of the certificates' lien beyond the rents to the real-estate equity did not make the legislation unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was adjudicated a delinquent child for committing the offense of grand theft by exerting unauthorized control over an automobile of a value in excess of $ 150. On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) the nature of the action guaranteed him the right to trial by jury in a delinquency proceeding; and (2) the option given to him under the Illinois statutory scheme to elect to be tried as a criminal and thus obtain a trial by jury constituted an unconstitutional burden on the free exercise of the right to trial by jury. Upon review, the court found that defendant's arguments were without merit. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the extension of a jury trial to juvenile court proceedings. The fact that a juvenile was given the option under the Illinois Juvenile Court Act to be proceeded against criminally, did not work to defeat the beneficial aspects of the Act. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-7(5) (1967) did not place an unconstitutional burden on defendant's free exercise of the right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment below. The court held that Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 4 provisions that truth was a defense in a libel action only when published with good motives and for justifiable ends were incompatible with First Amendment guarantees when applied to defamation of public officials or public figures, that the physician was a public figure, that the articles contained matters of public interest and concern, and that the trial court correctly refused the physician's jury instruction based upon the language of &sect; 4.

Section 24 made it a violation to store material in a place that could harbor rats in a residential area. Defendant appealed on numerous issues, including the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court affirmed and held that (1) the ordinance was not vague because it was clear enough so that a person of common intelligence could distinguish between the storing of items which would and would not invite an occupation by rats; (2) the ordinance did not objectionably delegate legislative authority because the question of whether there was a nuisance was still to be determined by a court or jury; (3) because the condition of the yard could be observed from the street, the taking of photographs did not constitute a search requiring a warrant; (4) defendant was not denied due process because the trial was conducted by a magistrate who was not an attorney because there was no requirement that a magistrate be an attorney; and (5) the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>

No further compensation was paid because the husband was not entitled to compensation as provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.7. The husband then brought a wrongful death action against the employer. The trial court dismissed the husband's action because his remedies were exclusively provided in the Workmen's Compensation Act. On appeal, the court affirmed and determined that even though the husband could not be compensated under the act, he could not maintain a wrongful death action against the employer. The court found that the husband could not be compensated under the act because he had not been totally dependent on his wife.

The divorced wife of the employee obtained a judgment from the trial court for an amount in arrearages in monthly alimony payments. The divorced wife then instituted proceedings against the Texas employer to satisfy the judgment pursuant to the Wage Deduction Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 62, para. 17, et seq. (1967). The Texas employer was served with a wage deduction summons. The Texas employer sought to dismiss the lawsuit of the divorced wife on the ground that Texas law prohibited garnishment of wages. On appeal, the court ruled that Texas was required to give full faith and credit to the Illinois wage deduction proceedings. The court found that the service of summons on the employer impressed a lien not only on the wages due but on subsequent earnings until the expiration of the employer's last pay period prior to 30 days after summons. The court ruled that wages paid in advanced to the employee by the Texas employer could not be garnished because there was no debt in being in favor of the employee that could be subjected to the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for entry of judgment based only on the attachable earnings. The court ruled that the divorced wife's claim did not attach to the advanced wage payments to the employee by the Texas employer.</SPAN></P>

However, the Illinois General Assembly expressly consented to the adjudication of tort claims against the state when it enacted the Court of Claims Act (Act), Ill. Rev.

The court found that, even though the board was not directly elected, it was a duly constituted corporate authority under the constitution, with appropriate authority to levy taxes. The court judged that the district was a distinct corporate entity, with constitutional fiscal limitations independent of those imposed on the surrounding county.

Const. art. IX, concerning a property tax. The state argued that the tax was a nonproperty tax and not subject to the constitutional limitations of art. IX imposed on a property tax. The court held that tax in question was not a property tax and therefore did not come within the limitations art. IX imposed on property taxes, and that under Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, the general assembly had the power to impose a tax on the privilege of earning or receiving income in or as a resident of Illinois. The court noted that the taxpayers had the burden of showing that the challenged classification was unreasonable; however, their only assertion was that corporations were at a disadvantage when they competed in the same type of business with individual proprietorships or partnerships because of the rate differential. The court, therefore, entered a judgment in favor of the state.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature's elimination of ordinary requirements was not unreasonable. The legislature could classify in response to distinguishing circumstances or conditions, as long as a single member of a class had needs that warranted particularized treatment.

The circuit court found the act constitutional in all respects except for a provision permitting public officials to serve as delegates of the convention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff contended that the constitutional grant of Ill. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1 was a limitation on the power of the general assembly to fix any qualification of delegates to the constitutional convention and that neither members of the general assembly nor public officials could constitutionally serve as delegates. The court disagreed with plaintiff. The court stated that membership in the convention did not meet the constitutional definition of an office. The court also stated that the records of the constitutional convention which drafted the constitution indicated that the members did not intend membership in a future constitutional convention to be incompatible with legislative offices covered in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3. Therefore the court held that state office holders covered by art. IV, &sect; 3 who were eligible for the office of senator were consequently eligible as delegates unless made ineligible by another provision of the constitution. The court also held that the governor, auditor of public accounts, secretary of state, superintendent of public instruction, and attorney general as well as impeached officers were disqualified under the constitution as delegates.</SPAN></P>

Police arrived and found that defendant's husband had been dead for a while. Defendant, who was 68, gave different stories about what happened. At trial, she claimed that she had struck her husband with a stick in self-defense. A pathologist testified that death resulted from shock caused by cuts and bruises and blood loss. The court reversed defendant's conviction for voluntary manslaughter. The court held that it was not at all clear that the death occurred as a result of the struggle, but assuming such to be the case, there were few circumstances indicating guilt, other than defendant's bizarre behavior in departing with the body and in making inconsistent explanations of its condition. The court held that if defendant's testimony was disregarded, there was little left but conjecture to establish that death was caused by her criminal conduct. The court held that the evidence did not carry with it a reasonable certainty of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 508a.

The trial court ruled in favor of the treasurer. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that only tax liens that existed against the land on the filing date of the petition could attach to the condemnation award. The court stated that the time of the taking was considered to have occurred as of the date that the eminent domain petition was filed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of the challenged ordinances required detailed records to be made upon the selling or giving away of a firearm. The other ordinance made the possession of a firearm unlawful, except in a person's home or place of business. The circuit court held that the part of the ordinance requiring the registration of silencers was unconstitutional, as it violated the privilege against self-incrimination but upheld the remainder of the ordinance. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that: 1) The power of the city to regulate firearms was not repealed by implication because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 83-1 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was operating a motorcycle without wearing a helmet or goggles when he was arrested by police officers. Defendant was convicted and challenged the conviction on the ground that the applicable statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 189c(a) (1967), violated his constitutional rights. Specifically, defendant argued that the statute classified motorcyclists separately. The court held that the classification had a reasonable basis and applied in exactly the same manner to all persons riding motorcycles. Therefore, it did not offend the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. However, the legislation was also purported to be in furtherance of the state's police power. After careful analysis, the court concluded that the manifest function of the headgear requirement was to safeguard the person wearing it from head injuries. Such a laudable purpose did not justify the regulation of what was essentially a matter of personal safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporate taxpayers appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed the taxpayers' complaint attacking the constitutionality of a minimum annual franchise tax imposed by the Illinois Supplemental Corporate Franchise Tax Act of 1967, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 157.133 (1967). The taxpayers claimed that para. 157.133 violated the uniformity provisions of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers also claimed that the tax violated equal protection because it classified companies according to whether their combined stated capital and paid-in surplus exceeded $ 100,000 per year. On appeal, the court disagreed. The only rule of uniformity required with respect to franchise taxes was that they had to uniformly apply to the class on which they operated. The legislature had broad discretion in establishing the classes to be taxed, and the basis on which classes were determined had to be reasonable. The court found that the classification based on stated capital and paid-in surplus was incidental to the passage of the franchise tax scheme, that the minimum tax was not unreasonable, and that it was uniform because it applied to all corporations. Further, the classification was not arbitrary because it was reasonably related to the subject being taxed and the minimum tax was reasonable in relation to the privilege granted. Thus, the fact that the tax could have weighed more heavily against a smaller corporation was irrelevant, and the resultant distinction between corporations based on stated capital and paid-in surplus did not result in a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment in favor of the lessor, concluding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 80, para. 15(a) (1967) unconstitutionally exempted certain entities from a rule invalidating exculpatory clauses in lease agreements as against public policy. Nevertheless, the relationship of the lessor and the lessee was generally a matter of private concern and exculpatory agreements were ordinarily given effect. That was so absent proof of a great disparity of bargaining power between the lessor and the lessee such that the latter was practically required to accept the lease on the lessor's terms. The lessee offered no facts to support its position that the parties did not deal at arm's length and upon equal footing. Finally, based on the express language of the exculpatory clause, the lessor was not liable to the lessee for damage to the oil station that was caused by the lessor's railroad.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 16-1 (1967). Defendant filed an appeal and asserted that para. 16-1 was unconstitutional and that the State's proof regarding the ownership of a stolen ring did not match the facts alleged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant was arrested, she was wearing a ring that had been stolen several days earlier from a jewelry store. The store was owned by a partnership, but defendant's subsequent theft indictment alleged that the ring had been stolen from one named partner rather than from the partnership. Defendant appealed her conviction and asserted that para. 16-1 was impermissibly vague and that the State's proof that the ring was stolen from the partners conflicted with the indictment's allegation that the ring was owned by one particular partner. In affirming, the court held that the language of the statute was not impermissibly vague when considered in context with longstanding statutory and common law interpretation. As one of the partners who owned the ring, the partner named in the indictment had a sufficient interest to support the indictment's allegation as to ownership. The variance in proof did not prejudice defendant. The partner's testimony could be used to establish the value of the ring because he had been a jeweler for over 20 years. The verdict was valid even though the jury failed to return a finding of the ring's value because jury instructions eliminated any ambiguity.</SPAN></P>

The agreement contained indemnity or exculpatory clauses. The conservator brought a personal injury lawsuit against the agency after the ward was struck by a train operated by the agency. The trial court dismissed the complaint, citing the indemnification clause in the contract between the company and the agency, but an intermediate appellate panel reversed, reinstating the complaint. On further appeal, the court reversed the panel's decision, thereby resurrecting the trial court's ruling and thus dismissing the conservator's complaint once again. The court held that the agreement between the ward's employer and the agency, whereby the employer agreed to indemnify the agency for any of negligence on the part of the agency towards the employer's workers, barred the action. The indemnification clause was enforceable because the agency's conduct was not willful or grossly negligent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bank trustee challenged the grant of summary judgment to appellee state agency from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), in its suit to have the State Toll Highway Authority Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, paras. 100-1 to 100-35 (1967), as amended, declared unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the Act, and appellant sought review directly to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellant was trustee for persons holding more than a certain amount in outstanding toll highway revenue bonds issued by the Ill. State Toll Highway Commission under a 1955 bond resolution. The appellant challenged the constitutionality of the Act, which was successor to and in many respects resembled the Act as void. He claimed it violated various sections of the state constitution. The state supreme court found that later amendments remedied any alleged defects possibly violating Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16; that the appropriation contained in &sect; 35(a) of the Act was for a single general purpose, expressed in its title, and adequately specified the objects and purposes for which it was made; that the Act was passed in accordance with the requirements of the Illinois constitution; that the explicit emergency clauses passed by amendment satisfied constitutional requirements for expression of an emergency; and that &sect; 12 of the Act contained no improper delegation of power to a nongovernmental agency. The judgment validating the Act, as amended, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. The reviewing court did not find the challenged statutory sections fatally vague or imprecise. The method provided for the temporary appointment of directors was not prohibited by state constitution. The allegation of prejudice to bondholders was gratuitous and unreasonable. The statute met constitutional standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the trustees of a village library district and opponents to a different library district, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). In quo warranto proceedings challenging the establishment of the two public library districts, the trial court entered a judgment of ouster with regard to the public library district that was established without a public referendum. It approved the other district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Public Library District Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 81 permitted the conversion of a public library into a public library district, provided that certain notice and hearing requirements were followed. In the event a petition with more than 100 signatures was submitted prior to a hearing on the conversion, the issue would be submitted to the voters. The elected boards of library directors of two villages initiated proceedings under the Act to convert the respective village libraries to public library districts. In one village, the district was established without a public referendum, and in the other the issue was submitted for a vote. Neither board complied with the notice and publication requirements of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 81, para. 1007-1 through 1007-3, which required in part that notices were to be filed with the township supervisors. The trustees challenged the ouster, and interested parties challenged the approval of the establishment of one public library district. On appeal, the court held that the failure of the two boards to fully and completely comply with the notice and publication requirements was fatal. It did not need to address the constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed in part, and remanded. It affirmed the judgment of ouster with regard to the district that was established without a public referendum. It reversed the judgment that approved the established of the second public library district. It remanded the cause with directions to enter a judgment of ouster as to the second district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a senator was elected to the office of lieutenant governor, he submitted his resignation as senator to the governor. The governor issued writs of election to defendants, commanding them to cause a special election to be held for the nomination of candidates to fill a vacancy for the senatorial district and a general special election for the election of a senator to fill such vacancy. The taxpayers filed a complaint asserting that the governor was neither required nor empowered to call a primary or general election and that the issuance of such writs was in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. The taxpayers sought to enjoin defendants from accepting nominating petitions on behalf of candidates and from ordering election supplies or performing certain other acts in connection with the special primary election. The trial court rendered judgment for defendants. On appeal, the court found that upon receipt by the governor, the senator's resignation became irrevocable.

When the employee sought to recover a workmen's compensation award from his employer, the Commission determined that he was only entitled to recover for the loss of a hand rather than the loss of an arm because only the hand was amputated in the workplace accident. The trial court affirmed that decision, and the employee appealed. The court reversed, holding that para. 138.8(e)9 violated Ill. Const. art.

Although the Illinois General Assembly could classify persons and objects for the purpose of legislative regulation, &sect; 22 prohibited the enactment of any local or special law which granted a special or exclusive privilege, immunity or franchise. Because the limitations in Ill. Rev.

Any apparent discrepancy between defendant's confession and the physical evidence was for the jury to consider in assessing the weight and credibility to be given the confession. Defendant also complained that an oral confession was improperly admitted into evidence against him without a preliminary hearing on the question of its voluntariness. The court found that two earlier hearings were held on his written confession, and under those circumstances an additional hearing was not required. The court found that photographs were admissible to show the nature and extent of the victim's wounds and to corroborate the confession, and the prosecution was not barred from introducing them simply because defendant was willing to stipulate to whatever might be shown by them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indigent and was convicted of theft. The court sentenced him to one year in prison and imposed a fine and costs. Defendant filed a petition to vacate that portion of the order that directed that he stand committed to jail in default of payment, contending that his right to equal protection was denied. The court affirmed the denial of his petition. The court held that invidious discriminations in the administration of criminal justice were unconstitutional. However, the court found that imprisonment of an indigent defendant to satisfy his fine did not constitute a denial of equal protection. Paragraph 1-7(k) was intended to enable the State to collect in labor fines that could not be collected by execution, and it applied as well to a case where a defendant was able to pay in labor but not in money as to a case where he was able to pay in money but unwilling to do so. Defendant could not rely on Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 180-6 (1967) because defendants were not permitted to be discharged from imprisonment for nonpayment of a fine unless they were physically unable to work at the institution of confinement or no work was provided there for them.</SPAN></P>

The claimant was assigned to work for a corporation for two weeks. The claimant received his orders and assignments from a foreman of the corporation, but was paid by the temporary agency.

The temporary agency and the corporation were held to be jointly and severally liable, with the corporation having primary liability. The court affirmed the award, holding that the claimant was a borrowed employee, not a dual employee, thus the primary liability was properly on the corporation.

Defendants filed motions to strike the complaints and for discharge, which were denied. Defendants then waived jury trial, pleaded not guilty, and were tried on stipulated facts. Defendants were found guilty and appealed, contending that the disorderly conduct statute was unconstitutional on its face in that it was vague and over broad, that the complaints did not charge the offense with constitutionally required specificity, and that the evidence did not establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court disagreed, holding that the disorderly conduct statute was not vague or over broad and, thus was constitutional. Defendants were adequately informed of the charges against them and the particular conduct that gave rise to the arrest and complaint. At no time did defendants request a more detailed statement of the offense and, therefore, could not maintain upon review that the complaint lacked specificity.

The trial courts reversed the Department's assessments on the basis that the discrimination against the custom-mixed feed was illegal. The court affirmed, holding that the Department's classification was arbitrary and unconstitutionally discriminated against the taxpayers because the classification had no discernible relationship to the realities of life since &sect; 1, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 (1963), of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act contemplated the additives to be taxable or not taxable depending upon whether or not they were incorporated into the resold property and there was no evidence that the products were retained within the animal when consumed as part of a custom-mixed ration but were not retained when consumed in a pre-mixed ration.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 825B (1959), for injuries sustained in an accident allegedly caused by the negligence of defendant private school.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The student sustained injuries when he fell in the private school's cloakroom.

On appeal, the court reversed the limited damage award and remanded the case on the issue of damages only. The court held that there was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the inadequate illumination in the cloakroom, or the slippery condition of the floor, or both, constituted negligence on the part of private school. Also, the trial court properly allowed the student's counsel to interrogate prospective jurors about their or their relatives' possible connection with insurance companies, which was a proper means to exercise the right to a peremptory challenge to prevent bias and prejudice. Further, the $ 10,000 damage limit of &sect; 825B of the Act violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 because it was purely arbitrary as compared with the liability of public schools and other governmental units and institutions, which were subject to unlimited tort liability.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no variance between the charges in the indictment and the proof that was adduced at trial and that the accomplice testimony, which was consistent on all material issues and was corroborated, along with the other evidence before the jury was not so improbable that it raised a reasonable doubt of defendants' guilt. Defendants were not denied access to a witness's statement, which was found not to exist.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The steel corporation unintentionally created an oil slick that would have necessitated the use of a special carbon filtration to keep city water from having a bad taste and bad smell.

The trial court granted the district's request for an injunction against the steel corporation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the district had the authority under Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bank sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted the motion to dismiss of appellee bank. Appellant brought an action of ejection against appellee. Both parties held record chains of title that did not have a common source for the same property. Appellee raised an affirmative defense under the Illinois Marketable Title Act. Both parties filed for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's record chain of title originated in a deed from a grant of the United States dated 1899 and appellee's record chain of title was held for at least 40 years before 1965 but subsequent to the 1899 deed. Appellant and appellee did not have a common source of title. Appellee contended that no verified statement of claim, as required under the Illinois Marketable Title Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, paras. 12.1-12.4 (1967), had been filed by anyone in appellant's record chain of title and that appellant, therefore, could not maintain its action under the Act. Appellant argued that the Act did not apply to a chain of title founded upon a wild deed, which it considered to be a chain of title not originating in a grant from the United States. On appeal, the court concluded that the Act contemplated the existence of only one record chain of titleholder and the Act's application was not intended in a case involving two competing record chains of title. The court held that appellee could not use the Act as a defense to the action. The court reversed and remanded to the circuit court to determine the merits of the parties' claims apart from the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings. The appellee could not use the Illinois Marketable Title Act (Act) as a defense to the action and the circuit court must determine the merits of the parties' claims apart from the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injunction issued by the trial court against the railroad company requiring it to remove ads that it had placed on its private property and prohibiting it from placing such ads without first obtaining permission from the city was based on &sect; 9-112 of the Illinois Highway Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 9-112 (Code), and Chicago, Ill. Code &sect; 36-30 (ordinance). The Code prohibited the placement of any advertising upon any state or local highway or other nearby structure &quot;other than such as may be directed by&quot; the authority having jurisdiction over the highway. The ordinance prohibited advertising upon an array of areas, including sidewalks, cross-walks, and lamp posts, except where such was required by law. In challenging the judgment, the railroad company claimed, among other things, that the Code was unconstitutionally void. In reversing the judgment the court agreed, finding that the Code's failure to provide any rules or standards to guide the city in making exceptions resulted in an unconstitutional delegation of power. The court also found that the ordinance only applied to advertising on public structures, and thus was inapplicable to the ads in this case.</SPAN></P>

At the post-conviction hearing, defendant's relatives testified that they went to the police station and tried to speak with defendant, but were not allowed to do so. Defendant testified that his request to see a lawyer and his relatives was refused. The police chief and three officers denied this testimony. The court pointed out that defendant's retained attorney made no objection to the introduction of the statement. The court concluded that the attorney wanted to use the statement to convince the jury that defendant's action was in self-defense. The court noted that Escobedo rights were not applied retroactively. The court refused to consider defendant's request to reduce the offense to manslaughter, noting that theory of the case was contrary to defendant's position at trial. The court rejected defendant's other arguments.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, fined $ 500 on the disorderly conduct charge, and sentenced to three months imprisonment for resisting arrest. Defendant appealed, contending various constitutional violations. On appeal, the court held that neither Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 26-1 (1967), nor Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 31-1 (1967), were vague or overbroad, that the language in the complaints were adequate to apprise him of the conduct that constituted the offense charged against him, that the state's failure to provide defendant with a complete list of its witnesses prior to trial was neither reversible error under Ill.

XIV, protected the rights to acquire, enjoy, own, and dispose of property, and that where the enforcement of private agreements would be violative of the public policy of the United States, courts could not enforce such agreements. The court noted that it was customary for courts of equity to evaluate the conduct of a plaintiff in terms of public policy apart from the other issues in a case, denying standing to maintain an action where a plaintiff's conduct was contrary to public policy.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's appeal was taken from the trial court's entry of judgment that was affirmed by the appellate court and those judgments were res judicata about all issues actually raised before those courts. Those issues that could have been raised, but were not, were deemed waived by defendant. Defendant's post-conviction petition failed to properly raise any question of constitutional dimension that was not rendered res judicata by the prior appeal from his conviction. His argument against the constitutionality of the statute under which he was indicted was addressed on his prior appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of rape, but after appeal the matter was remanded to the trial court for it to conduct a separate hearing to determine the voluntariness of his confession. In affirming the order and judgment, the court noted that trial court was not required to be convinced of the voluntary character of a confession beyond a reasonable doubt, and that its finding would be overturned only if it was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In upholding the result, the court noted the lack of corroboration of defendant's allegations that he was beaten. The court also held that pre-arraignment detention in excess of the statutory maximum did not make the confession per se involuntary. The court held that the state adequately explained its failure to produce witnesses to the confession.

The trial court held that the Act was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The legislature had the authority to create junior colleges under its power to create public corporations. The court held that the Act gave sufficient standards for the organization of junior college districts because it fixed minimum population at either 30,000 persons or at least three counties and assessed valuation at not less than $ 75 million as minimum standard. The Act also delegated power to the state board to determine adequate standards for the physical plant and facilities. The Act reasonably restricted judicial review of the state board's decision on a petition to organize a junior college district to those who appeared at the state board's hearing. The Act did not deny due process because it allocated state tax funds for local purposes. The Act did not violate the one man, one vote principle.</SPAN></P>

The protesters occupied two lanes of the six-lane roads and left the remaining lanes open to vehicular traffic.

The protesters refused to occupy only one lane, sat down in the middle of the intersection, and refused to move. The protesters, including defendants, were arrested and charged with obstructing traffic and disorderly conduct. Defendants' trials were consolidated and each was convicted and fined. Defendants sought review and argued that Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 27-291 and 193-1 violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 and denied defendants their freedom of speech and assembly. Defendants also argued that the ordinances were discriminatorily enforced and that they were victims of police entrapment. The court found that Ill. Const. art.

Defendant appeared in the courtroom after he had been convicted and the trial court permitted him to make an oral motion for new trial and granted him 10 days in which to reduce the motion to writing. Defendant's motion was denied and he appealed. The State argued that defendant's petition should be denied because the Post-Conviction Relief Hearing Act applied only to persons imprisoned at the time their cause was heard. The court rejected that argument, stating that there was no reason to so narrowly construe the Act. The court stated that defendant had an absolute right to be present at his trial and that such right could be waived only by defendant himself.

On appeal the court affirmed the appellate court decision and held that the will did not contain all of the elements necessary for incorporation of the trust agreement. The court found that the language of the will did not disclose any intention to incorporate the terms of the document into the will. Instead, the will manifested an intent to give decedent's property to the trustee to be administered as part of the inter-vivos trust and did not purport to create a testamentary trust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a bar patron was injured, his family received public aid benefits, and when he received a dramshop settlement, the department of public aid sought to enforce its lien under Ill.

In reversing an order holding the lien statute unconstitutional, the court concluded that while it was true that the statute did not provide comprehensively for a lien upon all potential assets that might be or become available to a recipient of public assistance, the validity of legislation did not depend upon complete comprehensiveness, nor did the constitution require that it conform to an ideal pattern of orderliness. It was enough if the selection of subjects for inclusion and exclusion rested upon a rational basis. Subjecting to public assistance liens those recoveries for injuries which resulted from alcoholic excesses, while excluding others not so connected, was not a completely arbitrary and unreasonable classification.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 68, para. 15 (1965) of the Family Expense Act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The Act did not purport to provide for control or interference in family affairs. The court found that the husband's objections were so beside the point that further discussion was unnecessary. The court rejected the husband's arguments that asserted neither common law nor statutory law specified any particular standard of living to which any man or his family was required to conform. The court found that the Family Expense Act was in force since 1874 with little question of its validity. Family expenses were expenses for articles that maintained the welfare of the family generally and tended to maintain its integrity. The husband failed to advance any satisfactory reason for his proposition that making the &quot;head of the family&quot; liable for such family expenses was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant director of revenue and others sought review a decree of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that held unconstitutional the 1967 amendments to the Service Occupation Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.101 (1967) et seq., the Service Use Tax Act, and the Municipal and County Service Occupation Tax Acts, as well as articles I-III of the Department of Revenue's Rules and Regulations implementing these amendatory acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the director of revenue and others argued that (1) the taxpayers' suit was not a proper case for a class action, in that the taxpayers were entitled to sue only for reimbursement of the tax monies paid by them or to enjoin the collection of those monies owing by them and not by all other &quot;servicemen&quot; in the state, and (2) that in any event, the amendatory acts were constitutional. The court held that the classifications made by the amendatory Service Occupation Tax Act and as incorporated in the other challenged acts challenged unconstitutional. The court determined that the distinctions made between the classes subject to taxation and those excluded were not sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands of uniformity, due process and equal protection of law for the purposes of a gross receipts tax. Thus, the court found the repealing sections of the 1967 amendments were inoperative, leaving the Service Occupation Tax Act and related acts in full force and effect as they existed prior to the adoption of the amendments. The court further held that the maintenance of a class action was proper.</SPAN></P>

The complaint was dismissed, but the trial court ordered that the taxes paid by plaintiffs under the acts be retained in a protest fund pending disposition of their appeal. In addition, pending the appeal, the legislature repealed the two acts. The appellate court ruled that the repeal had no effect upon the case and did not automatically entitle plaintiffs to a refund. In affirming the dismissal of their challenge to the acts, the court noted that the acts had recently been upheld against attack in another case. The court then ruled that the acts did not violate the one-subject requirement of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, and they were not unreasonably discriminatory. Likewise, the exemptions contained in the acts did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. The state legislature had broad powers to establish reasonable classifications in taxation and the exemptions provided in these acts were reasonably calculated to prevent unwarranted multi-state taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were found guilty, either in a jury or bench trial, of disorderly conduct for breaching the peace during a civil rights march. Some were fined $ 200 and some were fined $ 25. The march was to the mayor's home, seeking termination of the school superintendent over his handling of segregation. After several hours and after five requests to leave the area were ignored by defendants, in order to avert what the police believed was about to become a riot, the marchers were ordered to stop their demonstration. Upon their refusal they were arrested. Defendants appealed their convictions. The court affirmed. The record showed a determined effort by police to let the marchers peacefully demonstrate and at the same time maintain order. The record was clear that there was some violence (throwing rocks and eggs) and an imminent threat of extreme public disorder, and that the police made all reasonable efforts to protect the marchers before asking them to disburse. Defendants also argued that the disorderly conduct ordinance was unconstitutionally vague but the court interpreted the ordinance as authorizing the action taken by police under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The police testified that they stopped defendant for speeding. They observed in open view in the car policy writings and tickets. Defendant was placed in the squad car and his person searched. The officers knew defendant from prior gambling arrests. Ill. Code Crim. P. &sect; 108-1, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 108-1 (1965) allowed an officer, after a valid arrest, to search the arrestee and immediate area.

The search of the car trunk was reasonable to ascertain the owner or whether a crime was committed. The court repudiated the prior &quot;mere evidence&quot; doctrine that limited searches to only the instruments used to conduct the crime, the fruit of the crime, and weapons. Discovery of the evidence in plain view created probable cause to arrest. Once arrested, the search of defendant's person for contraband was proper.

The court held that the statutory requirements relating to the initialing of ballots by election judges were directory, rather than mandatory, when considered in relation to an election where the only paper ballots used on the issue or office in question were those of absentee voters, and the only irregularity complained of was the absence of such endorsement.

The county later enacted the sewage treatment and disposal ordinance, which applied to the purchaser's property. The circuit court declared that a provision of the county's ordinance was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement as to the purchaser. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's order because it was plain from the record that the ordinance's requirement that treated sewage waste could only be discharged into a &quot;continuously flowing&quot; stream was unreasonable and that the threat to the public health was distant. The facts illustrated that any possible public benefit which might have been gained from the enforcement of the ordinance was slight and that the hardship it could have inflicted on the individual property owners was great. The court did not perceive from the record a reasonable relationship between the public health and the ordinance's provision. The court concluded, therefore, that the provision of the county's sewage treatment and disposal ordinance represented an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of police power and so was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court noted that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 36-1 through 36-4 (1965) required the State to &quot;promptly&quot; determine whether to seek forfeiture. Finding that a delay of 105 days was not prompt, the court held that the State's action was inconsistent with the statute's commands and held that the trial court should have dismissed the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 91 1/2, para. 8-6 (1965), and then filed a motion to exclude the physician from the jury on the ground that the statutory requirement was unconstitutional. The circuit court overruled the patient's motion, and after the patient was called as an adverse witness by the state, the jury found that the patient needed mental treatment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 5 secured the right of trial by jury in all tribunals exercising common law jurisdiction. Jury trials did not exist in commitment proceedings; therefore, the Illinois constitution did not require a jury trial in a commitment proceeding. Additionally, the legislature could require a physician on the jury to achieve a blend of lay and expert judgment. Because the proceeding was civil in nature under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 91 1/2, paras. 2-3, 8-6, the patient had no privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administratrix argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 24f (1965) properly construed, did not apply to the wrongful death actions or to the actions to recover the funeral expenses of her husband and child. The administratrix contended that such an application of the statute violated several provisions of the state constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The architect argued that the statute gave architects and contractors special immunity. The court found that the statute, which did not grant others involved in the construction of buildings, did violate Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22, and therefore expressed no opinion upon the other constitutional issues that the administratrix raised. The court determined that the arbitrary quality of the statute clearly appeared when the court considered that architects and contractors were not the only persons whose negligence in the construction of a building or other improvement could cause damage to property or injury to persons.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 114-12 (1965), a motion to suppress was to be in writing stating the facts showing how the search and seizure were unlawful. The court determined that such motion should have been made before trial unless opportunity did not exist or defendant was unaware of the grounds for the motion. The court held that defendant could not have been held to have knowingly waived his constitutional right against illegal search and seizure because he was represented by various public defenders at different stages of the proceedings, which mitigated the strict application of &sect; 114-12 requiring that the motion be made prior to trial.

Pursuant to the Chicago Motion Picture Ordinance the films were submitted to the Film Review Section of the Chicago Police Department. The films were rejected. Appellee Chicago Motion Picture Appeals Board (board) then reviewed the films and rejected them for licensing in Chicago. The board then filed a motion in the trial court to enjoin the film corporation from showing the two films. The film corporation filed a motion to strike and dismiss the complaint. After reviewing the films, the trial court granted the injunction finding the films to be obscene. On appeal, the court concluded that the Chicago Motion Picture Ordinance did not violate the United States or Illinois constitutions. The court reasoned that the ordinance was not a prior restraint upon free speech and did not violate any constitutional right of the film corporation. The court further held that the films were obscene under the guidelines of the United States Supreme Court and therefore were beyond the protection of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or the Illinois state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge ruled that the voluntariness issue was waived when it was not raised by preliminary motion. Defendant's post-conviction petition alleged that he was denied equal protection of the law when the trial court refused to conduct a hearing to determine voluntariness and that he was denied due process of law because he was convicted on the basis of a coerced confession. On appeal of the dismissal of the action for post-conviction relief, the court held that defendant's conviction was unconstitutional because no independent determination of the voluntariness of defendant's statements was ever made. The trial court's ruling that such a hearing had to be conducted pretrial was erroneous. And the fact that defendant did not mention the voluntariness issue on the stand did not effect a waiver because by the time he took the stand, the trial judge had already ruled that the issue had been raised too late.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed his wife and sister after an argument. A competency hearing was held after he was indicted and at trial, he raised the insanity defense. A jury convicted him of both counts of murder and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 104 -- 2 (1965) required suspension of trial proceedings pending disposition of the competency hearing only after defendant was required to answer to a criminal charge and that he was not denied due process in that regard. There was no error in allowing two psychiatrists who examined defendant for purpose of the competency hearing to testify at trial because the trial court restricted the testimony to show defendant's mental condition and not the truth of any statement's made by defendant. The court held that recitation in a hypothetical question of intoxication was highly material and prejudicial because the only evidence adduced on the subject was the testimony of a witness and the police officers to the effect that defendant was not, in fact, intoxicated. There was substantial evidence to refute defendant's unsupported allegation of involuntariness and to admit his confession.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-31-1 (1965). The trial court entered an order authorizing the city to demolish the property owner's building on the basis that it was in a dangerous and unsafe condition. The property owner appealed, contending that the statute purporting to provide for such action was unconstitutional and that the finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence. On appeal, the court reversed, remanded, and held that by a fair interpretation of the statutory language of para. 11-31-1 the trial court was required to find the property owner's structure to be beyond reasonable repair before authorizing the extreme remedy of demolition and that evidence relating to the cost of repair compared to value was improperly excluded. The court should have found from the evidence what the specific defects were which rendered the building dangerous and unsafe. If they were such as could readily be remedied by repair, demolition was not to be ordered without giving the property owner a reasonable opportunity to make the repairs.</SPAN></P>

An administrative hearing was held and the driver's right to drive was suspended. The driver contended that &sect; 6-206 unconstitutionally deprived him of a valuable right without due process of law, the statute was void for uncertainty, and that the discretion vested in the Secretary denied him equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 6-206 was a clear and proper exercise of the State's police power and was fairly applied to the driver. Furthermore, the operation of a motor vehicle was subject to such reasonable regulation as the legislature may prescribe, and Secretary's suspension of the driver's license was not an exercise of judicial power and not violative of Ill. Const. art. III. Moreover, because the proceedings were civil and administrative in character, the requirements of due process were met by giving the driver notice and the opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 500.18 (1959), was unconstitutional and entered a decree declaring the organization's property not to be tax exempt in the organization's action against appellee tax assessor for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The organization sought a declaratory judgment that its headquarters building was exempt from taxation and sought an injunction against the collection of real estate taxes on the property. The trial court held that &sect; 19.18 of the Revenue Act, which provided that all property of veterans' organizations used exclusively for charitable, patriotic, and civic purposes was exempt from taxation, was unconstitutional. The trial court entered a decree declaring the property not to be tax exempt. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 19.18 pertaining to veterans' organization was not unconstitutional. It was not a broader exemption than that permitted by the Ohio Constitution. The court further found that the organization's property was not used for purposes that made it exempt from taxation under &sect; 19.18. Although the organization was clearly a veterans' organization, it failed to prove that its property was used exclusively for charitable, patriotic, and civil purposes. The record showed that the property was used primarily for social and business meetings, wedding receptions, and dinners. None of the uses were per se patriotic and charitable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the judgments, and the court affirmed them. Plaintiff city filed a motion to dismiss the appeal pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct.

The court held that defendant's conduct of sitting on a sidewalk, blocking a city hall entrance, and obstructing pedestrian traffic had no connection with the constitutional protections of the rights of free speech and assembly. The court found that the complaints were sufficiently specific and that defendant nowhere explained how she was inadequately informed of the charges against her. The court noted that defendant and her counsel were well aware of the particular conduct that brought about the arrest. The court held that the complaints adequately advised defendant of the nature of the offenses and were sufficient to enable her to prepare a defense. The court concluded that Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking an order requiring respondent county sheriff to release him from custody. The Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit in Will County (Illinois) had ordered petitioner detained for a hearing pursuant to &sect; 8 of the State Penitentiary Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108, para. 112 (1965), in order to determine whether petitioner was a sexually dangerous person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One day before he was scheduled to be released from prison, a petition was filed seeking to declare petitioner a sexually dangerous person. The circuit court remanded petitioner to the custody of the sheriff pending resolution of the petition. Petitioner sought relief, asserting that the proceedings were not valid because the original petition was not brought on behalf of the Illinois Department of Public Safety as required by &sect; 8 of the Act and because all of the proceedings on the petition were not completed prior to the expiration of his sentence. In quashing the writ, the court held that the proceeding was clearly commenced on behalf of the Department; an affidavit was filed documenting that fact and the petition was amended to name the Department as the complaining party. The determination of whether petitioner was a sexually dangerous person had to be made just prior to his release, and the petition had been filed before petitioner was released as required by &sect; 8. It was to be expected that petitioner's release would be delayed so that the proceedings could be resolved. The resulting delay was not unreasonable and did not violate petitioner's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a labor dispute involving the city's firemen, the union filed a mandamus action to compel the city to engage in nonbinding arbitration. The city filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that paras. 10-3-8 through 10-3-11, which provided the nonbinding arbitration procedure for firemen, violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. The court explained that paras. 10-3-8 through 10-3-11 made an unreasonable classification of municipal employees in that it afforded firemen an arbitration procedure not available to other municipal employees. The trial court denied the motion and ordered the city to comply with the statute. The city appealed. The court affirmed, holding that paras. 10-3-8 through 10-3-11 were constitutional. The court found that the hazardous nature of the firemen's employment and the vital interest of the public in prompt and adequate protection against fire justified the classification. Firemen were entitled to receive adequate compensation for their services, commensurate with the hazards of their job. The legislature's belief that the arbitration procedure would enhance the possibility of hiring and retaining firemen was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court found that under the tax ordinance the consumers paid the taxes and the company was but a conduit for the transmittal of moneys to the city. The court concluded that the consumers paid the company its costs of transmitting the funds, and the Company so far as the franchise contract was concerned remained in the same position it occupied prior to the enactment of the utility tax ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was shot and killed in a police station. Defendant was questioned immediately thereafter, and admitted taking the gun from the sleeve of a bulky jacket he was wearing and shooting the decedent. There was no allegation that the confession was coerced until after defendant was convicted. The court held that defendant could not make a constitutional claim for the first time on appeal. The trial of the case at bar occurred before the United States Supreme Court decisions in Miranda and Escobedo. The court therefore held that any failure to advise defendant of his constitutional rights and the failure to provide him with counsel were only attendant circumstances in deciding whether his confession was voluntary. The court held that the admission of the confession into evidence was not error, and affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge agreed with defendant and discharged defendant. Four days later the State's Attorney secured an indictment charging defendant with the same offense. Defendant appealed his conviction arguing that the unappealed ruling of the associate judge was res judicata, and that the trial judge's denial of the subsequent motion for discharge was improper. The court held that the disposition of the case by the associate judge was an allowance of defendant's motion for discharge by reason of the failure to accord him a speedy trial, it was an appealable order, and not subject to later review by the trial judge. Therefore, the court held that a redetermination by the trial judge of the correctness of that ruling was improper. Accordingly, the court reversed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a declaratory judgment action, plaintiffs, real estate board, real estate brokers, and individual and corporate brokers, challenged the constitutionality of the Chicago Fair Housing Ordinance, which declared it unlawful for real estate brokers to discriminate on account of race, color, religion, or national origin in the sale, rental, or financing of residential property. The trial court decreed that the ordinance was constitutional and denied an injunction against defendants, city, mayor, and commission on human relations.

The ordinance could not be deemed a denial of property without due process, though it interfered with the rights of plaintiffs to contract with persons of their choice.

The board upheld its initial decision to terminate the teacher, and the trial court upheld the board's decision. The court affirmed the trial court. The court held that there was no proof that the teacher's statements were protected by the right to free speech guaranteed by the federal Constitution. Though a private citizen could subject the board to false accusations in the absence of malice, the teacher could not harm the board or the schools by speech; as an employee, the teacher did not have a constitutional right to make detrimental statements regarding the board and the schools. As ample evidence established that the teacher's conduct was detrimental to the efficient operation and administration of the schools, the board's decision was not against the manifest weight of evidence and was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which sustained the jury verdict for the widow and concluded that the $ 25,000 monetary limitation of the Wrongful Death Act should not be applied to the cause of action created under the Work Act. The court found the Work Act had never contained a limitation on the amount recoverable for death under the act. The court held that the failure to apply the monetary limitation of the Wrongful Death Act to this action did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art.

The complaint prayed for judgment in the amount of the assessment. The trial court entered judgment against the policyholder. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found the liability sought to be enforced was contractual, and that the policyholder voluntarily entered into the contract that clearly provided for contingent liability. The court held that the mutual company could have, but did not, engage in business by complying with the identical reserve requirements under Ill. Rev.

The court noted that defendant's positive identification by the complaining witness was corroborated by the otherwise unexplained presence of his wallet found beside her bed and by the small, tell-tale marks found outside her bedroom window fitting the description of the heel of his walking cast. Defendant also claimed that he was denied his constitutional guaranties of due process and equal protection of the laws under both the Federal and State constitutions in that no stenographic transcript was made of his preliminary hearing.

The police used a reliable informant under a carefully controlled buy situation, which justified the arrest and search. The court then agreed that knowledge was crucial to the statute.

The board of education filed a motion to dismiss for failure to provide the required six month notice under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, paras. 823-24 (1963). The teacher contended that she did not furnish the notice because she had relied on statements made by the board of education's insurer. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded with instructions that the trial court deny the motion to dismiss. The court held that the statutory notice provision was null and of no force and effect because it granted a special privilege to schools in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. The court concluded that the notice permitted and denied recovery on an arbitrary basis for the filing of the notice within the time period, and that the notice bore no discernible relationship to the realities in life because had she fallen instead on the property of a city, county, or drainage district her action would not have been barred by failure to provide the notice.</SPAN></P>

The petition and its supporting exhibits disclosed that the attorneys incurred financial burdens and hardships far in excess of those normally attendant upon the defense of indigent persons, especially because the state had demanded the death penalty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer filed suit, seeking a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The taxpayer also filed a demand for jury trial. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss, supported by affidavit, under Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 110, para. 48(3) of the Illinois Civil Practice Act. This motion was allowed and the complaint was dismissed. The taxpayer filed a direct appeal to the court, alleging that he was denied a jury trial in violation of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 5. The court affirmed, noting that the issues presented in the case and the relief sought would not have entitled a party to a jury trial under the common law at the time of adoption of the Illinois constitution. Thus, the trial court correctly held that there was no right to trial by jury and no constitutional rights of the taxpayer were violated. Although no substantial constitutional questions warranting a direct appeal existed, the court decided to render an immediate decision rather than transferring the case to the appellate court. The court noted that it had already determined that the Act was constitutional upon grounds encompassing the taxpayer's issues and held that the trial court properly dismissed the suit.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-8 (1965), which required a person making bail for another to deposit cash or stock and bonds equal in value to the amount of bail or unencumbered real estate in value to twice the amount of bail, violated Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner, indicted for burglary, obtained a bail bond with a licensed surety company. The bond was refused because no security was deposited with the clerk of the court as security for the bond as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-8 (1965). The prisoner claimed that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-8 (1965) violated Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, which provided that all persons were bailable by sufficient sureties, expect for capital offenses. The court denied the prisoner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional. The purpose of the bail bond statute was to ensure the attendance of an accused at trial through the threat of economic loss. The employment of a professional surety alone did not result in the threat of economic loss furthering the purpose of the statute. Moreover, the court held that the alternative methods of bail provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 110-7, 110-8 (1965) did not violate the constitutional provision that all persons shall be bailable by &quot;sufficient sureties&quot; because &quot;sufficient&quot; meant adequate to assure the accused's attendance at trial, not merely adequate to pay the bondsman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both defendants were charged with violations of the obscenity statutes. The first defendant alleged that the books were illegally seized from his bookstore. On review, the court agreed, finding that only one of the books found was actually contained in the search warrant. The court stated that the other seized books were not contained in the warrant. The court determined that the constitution required that the warrant had to be very particular in describing the items to be seized when those items included books. In addition, the court found that the police officers that conducted the search did not have a general warrant, but they treated the warrant they did have as a license for a general warrant. The court held that the officers did not stumble across the books seized and therefore the evidence was illegally obtained. The second defendant alleged that the obscenity statute was unconstitutional and that he was not aware that the books in question were obscene when he sold them. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the second defendant's conviction. The court reasoned that there was no evidence that the cover of the book sold was obscene.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IV &sect; 13 and were otherwise unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the permanent injunction, holding that the new acts and the amendments to the existing acts were part of a common scheme of taxation and the constitution was not violated. Each amendment excluded transactions subject to the new taxes to prevent double taxation. There was no discriminatory burden on lessees due to the different bases for computing taxes. If any discrimination resulted, it was between purchasers and lessees; however, there was no constitutional requirement that these two groups be treated equally. Further, exemptions of property moved by interstate carrier avoided a conflict with the Commerce Clause and did not affect the plaintiffs. Neither the incorporation by reference of sections of another act nor the refund procedures were unconstitutional, and the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the city had no implied power to regulate the privately owned school buses and noted that the legislature expressly exempted school buses and drivers from specified areas of municipal regulation. By providing for comprehensive regulation, it was implied that municipalities had no power to regulate the activity.

His motion for an inquiry into abuses that he might suffer from Alabama officials was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor issued a warrant of rendition for the fugitive in an extradition process. The fugitive had been convicted of armed robbery in Alabama and had escaped from prison. A writ of habeas corpus was issued. The sheriff relied on the warrant as justification for the detention. The fugitive did not attack the sufficiency of the warrant, but only sought inquiry into the abuses. The trial court remanded him to the sheriff's custody for his return to Alabama authorities. Without a formal offer of proof, the fugitive argued that the Alabama prison and law enforcement officials, without a practical opportunity to remedy such abuses in Alabama state or federal courts, would subject him to unconstitutional treatment upon extradition. He made no claim of any prior violation of his constitutional rights. The court found the trial court was correct in quashing the writ of habeas corpus and remanding the fugitive to the custody of the sheriff. He made no showing that relief was unavailable to him in the Alabama courts and to hold otherwise would permit fugitives to use the judiciary of Illinois as a supervisory agency over the federal and state judicial systems in the other 49 states.</SPAN></P>

The statutory requirement that the trial court enter an order discharging a person who had been granted an absolute discharge by a hospital superintendent was merely a ministerial duty to clarify court records and to show that the person hospitalized on court order was discharged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's denial of the patient's motion for an order discharging the patient from a state hospital. The court remanded the case with directions to the trial court to enter its order discharging the patient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff brewing company appealed from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which refused to enjoin defendant, the Illinois Director of Revenue, from taking any steps to assess against and collect from the company any use tax or service use tax, or penalties, with respect to certain items of tangible personal property located in the state. The Director's motion to dismiss the company's amended complaint had been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The brewing company provided advertising materials to retailers in Illinois by directing the fabricators to ship the items to wholesalers who would then distribute them to retailers. The company argued that these materials were not subject to the use tax because they were never in its possession and because it had not intended to acquire title to or property in them. The company also alleged that prices to wholesalers were not increased to cover the cost of these materials. For purposes of the service use tax, the company alleged that it provided signs to retailers but that it did not lease these signs or receive any payment for them. The court held that, for purposes of the taxing statute, the company was the owner of the advertising materials. The company caused these items to be made, paid for their manufacture, and had complete control over their disposition. The court also held that the company's use of the signs for its benefit in the natural way in which signs were used was the exercise of an incident of ownership rendering the service use tax applicable. The court finally ruled that the company could be subjected to penalties for failing to file tax returns.</SPAN></P>

The commission found that the employer falsely recorded the examination grade of a black applicant for employment in order to avoid hiring him. The lower court affirmed the commission's ruling that the employer had committed an unfair employment practice. The employer sought review. The employer challenged not only the sufficiency of the evidence, but also the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Fair Employment Practices Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 851-66 (1963). On appeal, the court reversed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court in dismissing the complaint. The court rejected the argument that because the printing process was substantially the same, and the inks used were basically the same, it was unconstitutional to not assess certain taxes against a subclass of publishers who printed news material versus the class who primarily printed letterhead and stationary. The court held that the Service Occupation Tax Act and the other taxing acts being challenged did not establish an arbitrary or unreasonable classification by excluding from the tax the service occupation of printing for the primary purpose of conveying news. The court noted that while it was true that all those engaged in the broad category of &quot;printing&quot; performed similar functions in that they all imprinted ink on paper and transferred the finished product to a customer, they were not engaged in the same service occupation. Although both occupations employed a similar physical process, the finished products were used for clearly distinct purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After considerable difficulty in seating an impartial jury, a juror informed the trial court that she had a longstanding fear of closed places. The trial court questioned the juror and informed defense counsel of the juror's condition, but refused to grant a motion for the juror's withdrawal or disclose the juror's identity. On appeal, the court held that the trial court committed reversible error in not granting defendants' motion because to accept the juror and not provide defense counsel the opportunity to interrogate the juror constituted prejudicial error under the circumstances. Additionally, the court held that the trial court erroneously admitted secretly made tape recorded conversation into evidence against those defendants who had not consented to the making of the recordings because, under Ill. Crim. Code, art. 14, &sect; 14-1, the evidence was obtained without the consent of defendants and could not be admitted into evidence against them in either a criminal or civil trial.

The court found that there was a sufficient showing of identity of the state officials as the persons whose conversations were recorded. The court also found that H.R. 2269 authorized a commission to investigate the charges arising out of the tape recordings. The court further found that H.R. 2269 expressed a clear intent that a legislative investigation be conducted for the purpose of impeachment or expulsion of the state officials and that the eavesdropping statute, Ill.

Lastly, the court found that there was no intention on the part of the general assembly to permit the use of the tapes in court because the other provisions of that Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Packages were taken from the person of the defendant at the time of his arrest. They contained heroin. The arresting officers had neither an arrest warrant nor a search warrant, but allegedly acted upon information received from an unidentified informant. Defendant contended this was an unlawful search and seizure. He challenged the use of the informant. In his bench trial, the trial court sustained the objection of the prosecutor to cross-examination of the arresting officer as to the identity of the informer, overruled defendant's motion to suppress, and denied his request to produce the informer. Defendant contended the reliability of the confidential informer was not sufficiently established. The court disagreed, finding there was sufficient proof of trustworthiness in the officer's testimony. The trial judge properly determined the officer's credibility. The Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 22-3, -40 (1963) were not unconstitutional as applied to narcotics addicts. Portions of the act were invalid only insofar as they penalized the status or condition of addiction. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The complaint was filed in Illinois, but the cause of action arose in Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow and her husband were in an automobile accident in Florida that resulted in the husband's death. The wife filed a complaint in Illinois against the husband's estate for negligence and the trial court found in favor of the administrator. The widow appealed and contended that both the Illinois statute and the Florida common law that granted interspousal immunity were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the Illinois immunity statute was determinative of the question and found the immunity statute constitutional. The court reasoned that the fact that the alleged tortious act took place in Florida was of no significance in determining which law should have governed the determination of the issue. The court found that the question of whether one spouse could have maintained an action in tort against the other spouse was clearly a matter that was governed by the law of the domicile of the persons involved. Illinois had the predominant interest in the preservation of the husband-wife relationship of its citizens, and to apply the laws of Florida to the issue of interspousal tort suits between Illinois residents would have been illogical.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court decision that granted the administrator's motion to dismiss the widow's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners challenge to the validity of the ordinance was directed at its requirement that an attendant be present at all self-service, coin-operated laundries between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 11:30 P.M., and the provision that prohibited the operation of coin-operated, self-service laundries between the hours of 11:30 P.M. and 6:30 A.M. The owners contended that neither of those provisions bore any reasonable relation to public health, safety, or welfare. After a master made his report concerning the ordinance, the city council amended the ordinance in an attempt to meet his objections, but the trial court refused to consider those amendments when they were offered in evidence before the decree was entered. The court held that the trial court erred in refusing to consider the ordinance as it existed when the case was decided. The attendant and compulsory closing provisions of the ordinance were neither arbitrary nor unreasonable and they did not violate the Illinois Constitution or the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The issue was the orderly allocation of jurisdiction among in-state circuit courts that dealt with petitions and actions in multiple counties for custody of the child. Respondent had violated an out-of-state court decree awarding custody of the child to petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An out-state-state court awarded custody of the child to respondent mother, but later transferred custody to petitioner father. Respondent violated the out-of-state court decree and brought the child to the forum state. Respondent filed an action in a circuit court, asking that the child's custody be transferred to respondent. Petitioner filed a habeas action in another county's circuit court (habeas county court) and was awarded custody of the child, and respondent appealed. The record did not reveal in which lawsuit service of process was first effected. The court assumed that jurisdiction was first secured in the habeas county court, and the court assumed that without personal jurisdiction the circuit court for respondent's action would have been unable to grant the relief that respondent sought. However, the habeas county court ignored the pending action in the circuit court, which could have granted the relief that petitioner sought. Petitioner should have raised the objections to respondent's claim in the circuit court for respondent's action. The court reversed the decision of the habeas county court.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 132.6a-1 (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature declared the construction of certain facilities on a University of Illinois campus to be in the public interest under the Illinois Building Authority Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 213.1, et seq. (1963). The Board advertised for bids, but the bids received were rejected as excessive. Instead of re-advertising as provided by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 132.4, the Board agreed that the Authority would advertise. However, in soliciting bids the Authority did not comply with the separate bid procedures set forth in para. 132.6a-1 but employed a single bid system. In appellees' action for declaratory judgment as to the applicability of the Act to bids solicited by the Authority, the trial court found for appellees. The court reversed, finding that the Authority was not a state agency under the Act and thus not subject to the requirements of para. 132.6a-1 because it did not expend or encumber state funds. The financing of the construction at issue was wholly derived from the sale of revenue bonds by the Authority under Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 127, par. 213.5(d) (1963), which did not create a debt of the state because the Authority was a separate corporate entity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the purpose of the statute was to discourage illicit traffic in narcotics and was reasonably related to the public safety and welfare. The meaning of the section was clear and adequately described the evil to be met and the practiced to be avoided. The section was not violative of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, which required the subject of a legislative bill be expressed in its title. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant where the jury disbelieved defendant's and his witness's version of the events. The entrapment defense was unavailable to defendant because he denied any participation in the crime. There was no proof that the jury read prejudicial newspaper articles. The trial court's description of the case as a narcotics matter was justified and substantiated by the indictment. The admission of the sack of dried leaves and defendant's conversation about prostitution and stimulant pills was proper. The jury instructions were correct.

The trial court granted the school board's petition. The superintendent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to the legislature's authorization at 122 Ill. Comp. Stat. 2/3.12(1963) to establish minimum standards for school health and safety, the superintendent published a 151-page circular. The Superintendent's Rule 102.04 stated that the rules superseded all other codes and ordinances relating to schools. The school board had recently spent $ 550,000 to bring its schools up to the fire code. The school board estimated that the superintendent's specifications required survey would cost $ 60,000, and the required changes would cost $ 1,000,000. The superintendent alleged that, if any specification was invalid, that provision was separable from the whole. The school board alleged that the statute unconstitutionally delegated law-making power to the superintendent. The court reversed the trial court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional, but affirmed the trial court's finding that the superintendent's specifications were unconstitutional. The court held that the superintendent's rules were not separable and that the superintendent exceeded his authority. The superintendent was authorized to define &quot;minimum&quot; standards, but not to replace existing codes and ordinances.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the taxpayer's affirmative defense alleged sufficient facts to challenge the validity of the Board's composition. Further, the taxpayer was not required to exhaust administrative remedies before asserting the defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An arbitrator awarded worker's compensation benefits for 60 weeks each for the worker's fractured vertebra and for his fractured skull. The Industrial Commission partially reversed and awarded a total of 60 weeks of compensation for the fractured vertebra, but made no award for the fractured skull. The worker sought review, and the trial court affirmed. The worker appealed, contending the provision of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.8(d) (1963) that limited recovery to a total of 60 weeks was unconstitutional as violative of due process and equal protection and was discriminatory. The court disagreed, holding that both the skull fracture and the fractured vertebra arose in the course of the worker's employment. The statutory provisions for 60 weeks of compensation were unrelated to the worker's ability to work, to the severity of the fracture, or to any decrease in earning power as a result of the injuries. In the absence of proof of a decrease in the worker's earning power, the worker was not eligible for more compensation than that payable for either of the individual injuries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for the armed robbery of a deliveryman and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in that he was so inadequately prepared at the time of the trial as to effectively preclude meaningful representation. The record did not clearly establish that counsel performed his trial duties in an incompetent manner and that defendant was substantially prejudiced. The complaining witness's testimony was clear and positive and was corroborated by the testimony of a police officer and the testimony concerning the oral admissions of guilt. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court was required to appoint an attorney other than the public defender pursuant to defendant's request even though such attorney originally appointed had been allowed to withdraw and this action had been acquiesced in by him. The sentence was justified as defendant had been twice previously convicted of felonies and had violated probation granted after his first conviction.</SPAN></P>

The officers proceeded to the bedroom and observed defendant standing near the bathroom door. The officers entered the bathroom and discovered several packets containing narcotics floating on top of the water in the toilet. The officers asked defendant if the packets belonged to him, to which he responded affirmatively. Defendant was found guilty of the crime of unlawful possession of narcotic drugs pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 22-3 (1961), which declared narcotics addiction a crime, and admitted to probation, which was later revoked. Defendant appealed the order revoking his probation and his conviction. The statute under which defendant had been convicted was declared unconstitutional, thus defendant argued that because his conviction was based under an invalid statute, the order revoking his probation was also void. The court claimed to have no way of knowing whether the trial court's reason for revocation was due to the conviction of narcotics addiction or based on subsequent convictions, and ordered the cause remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board argued that this proceeding was improperly filed as an original mandamus action since it was, in reality, a suit for declaratory judgment and injunction.

The court therefore granted the writ to compel the performance of an affirmative duty, that being compelling a board member, the Secretary of State, to advise those inquiring that: the existing congressional apportionment statute was unconstitutional and hence void, that no nominating petitions circulated within the existing districts would be accepted by the board for certification, and that future congressional elections were to be conducted pursuant to a constitutionally valid plan yet to be devised.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department obtained a permanent injunction against the child care agency's continued operation without a license pursuant to a special enforcement statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 63b11. The child care agency appealed based on a provision of the Child Care Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 2301 et seq., which provided that the operation of an unlicensed child care facility was a misdemeanor. The child care agency therefore argued the denial of a jury trial was unconstitutional, because any action to enjoin its operation amounted to a criminal proceeding. The court found that the child care agency was without standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act because they had not submitted a renewal application upon a Department-issued renewal form. The court rejected the child care agency's argument that the requirement that the renewal applications have been made upon the Department-issued forms was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because the areas of inquiry upon the application were specifically limited by statutory designation, therefore sufficient legislative standards existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature passed the Bond Act to provide for improved financing for recreational facilities in state parks. On appeal, the resident asserted that the Bond Act was confusing in light of the financing and management contemplated by other state conservation statutes. The court distinguished the other legislation because it governed registration, licensing and regulation, and the funds generate were general revenue. Funds collected under the Bond Act went to a specific trust fund. The State Parks Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 105, para. 468.3, was amended so as not to conflict with the Bond Act. There was no conflict between the Bond Act and the Illinois Building Authority Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, &sect; 213.1 et seq., because it was not offensive to the state constitution for the state agencies to exercise similar powers and the Building Authority was not authorized to construct facilities without the approval of the legislature. The court rejected the resident's argument that the State Parks Revenue Bond Commission was empowered to prohibit appropriations that could have violated Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voter filed a complaint for declaratory relief arising out of constitutional legislative reapportionment.

Const. art. IV did not violate Ill. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 2 because it was not necessary for the proposed amendment to describe the precise geographical boundaries of the district and all other details and the legislature was given discretion. The court held that the first and second paragraphs of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 were unconstitutional because geographical area alone was a constitutionally impermissible basis for districting. However, the court upheld the balance of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 6, 7, 8 because the principle of dividing the state into three major regions based on political subdivisions was not was not constitutionally unsound if they were compatible with population requirements. Also, the purposes sought to be achieved were clearly multiple, independent, and severable. The court held that the general assembly had inherent power to redistrict the senate.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that no statute could have overrode the constitutional mandate.

Defendant was fined $ 1000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was the managing partner of an enterprise that specialized in books of a salacious character. She testified that most of the books sold by the enterprise dealt with sex in a contemporary nature. She prepared advertising circulars describing these books, and she knew that some of the books sold by the enterprise from its specialized stock were not to be sent through the mail because they had probably been declared obscene. The enterprise's method of doing business was devised to insulate the managing partner from scienter. The court upheld the circuit court's judgment. First, the court rejected defendant's argument that the statutory definition of obscenity found in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20 (1963) and that the statutory provisions relating to the admissibility of evidence were unconstitutional. Not only was evidence admissible as to the social importance of the allegedly obscene materials, a determination as to the presence or absence of social importance was essential to a judgment.

The father contended that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and remanded for further proceedings. The court found that the statute was arbitrary and unconstitutionally discriminated against the father. The court found that the legislature had enacted statutes, which allowed injured parties to recover against city parks and school districts in personal injury actions. The court found that it was inappropriate for the legislature to enact &sect; 12.1, which completely barred recovery against forest preserve districts. The court found the distinction between city parks and forest preserve districts was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

He was tried in the municipal court, was found guilty, and was fined as to each book. From the said judgments and fines, the owner prosecuted an appeal. Upon review, the court reversed the decision. The court found that it was proper for the trial court to submit the publications to the jury under proper instructions as to the applicable standards for judging obscenity. The court also found that it was proper for the books to be taken to the jury room without having been read to the jury in open court. However, the court determined that the literary merit of the books did not go substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. The court found that the books were not utterly without redeeming social importance. Accordingly, the court held that the jury improperly found the books to be obscene.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 10-7-55 (1961) was unconstitutional and enjoined defendants, retirement board and its members, from giving pension credit to certain policemen pursuant to the statute. Plaintiff taxpayers filed a cross-appeal from the decree insofar as it assessed them with one-half of the master's fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two taxpayers brought an action to enjoin the retirement board and its members from giving pension credit to policemen for time spent in military service pursuant to an amendment to &sect; 10-7-55. Two policemen who were eligible for benefits under the amendment intervened. The cause was referred to a master who found the provision invalid because it gave preferential treatment to policemen who were eligible for civil service in 1938 and did not give similar treatment to policemen who became eligible after that time. The master recommended that the balance of the provision be upheld. The circuit court held that the amendment was invalid in its entirety and granted the relief requested by the taxpayers. The court affirmed and held that the provision giving preferential treatment to certain policemen with military service was not reasonably related to the object of the legislation. The court also found that the balance of the provision could not be upheld after striking the offending portion because to do so would create an entirely different law, in no sense an expression of the legislative will. The court ruled that the trial court correctly held the statute invalid as a whole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district filed a petition with the board for a variation in the use of a parcel of property in order to build a sewage disposal plant. The property was zoned residential and light industrial, but neither zone permitted a sewage disposal plant. The landowners objected to the district's petition because their property was adjacent to the property for which the district sought a variation. The board granted the district the variation. The landowners filed a complaint against the board and the district for administrative review. The circuit court and the court affirmed the board's decision. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, paras. 3154-3157 (1963), which authorized the variations, was constitutional. The court held that the board was specifically authorized by the county zoning ordinance to grant variations. The board's decision to grant the variance was supported by substantial evidence because the proposed sewage disposal plant was needed for the public welfare, was not objectionable, and was needed at that particular site.</SPAN></P>

The court first noted that when, as in this case, the jurisdiction of the court upon direct appeal was sought to be invoked upon the ground that a constitutional question was involved, the constitutional claim must have been raised and passed upon in the trial court. However, even if it could be said that a substantial constitutional question as to the validity of section 1 of the Uniform Arbitration Act, Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the crime of advertising for employees during a strike without stating in the ad that a strike was in progress. Defendant attacked the validity of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 2c, 2d (1961) on several grounds, but the court did not reach the constitutional questions. The evidence failed to prove that the advertisement was published while a strike or lockout was in progress, and for that reason the conviction could not stand. The state clearly failed to prove the existence of a strike, as charged in the information, at the time the advertisement appeared. The fact that there may have been picketing, or a &quot;labor dispute&quot; with the union, was not sufficient. The statute said &quot;strike or lockout,&quot; and it had to be proved that a strike or lockout was in progress before an accused could be properly convicted thereunder.

The court quashed the writ of habeas corpus and rejected the prisoner's claim that the schedule at issue, promulgated pursuant to Ill. Rev.

The court ruled that the legislature could constitutionally delegate the duty to prescribe a schedule of good-time credits; that the statutory standards prescribed by the legislature, though minimal, were intelligible and sufficient to guide the Department in the performance of its duty to prescribe rules for good-time credit; and that the schedule of good-time credits as promulgated by the Department was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant citizens challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which sustained the motion of appellees, city and board of education, to strike the citizens' complaint, denied them leave to file an amended complaint, and dismissed their suit seeking a declaration that the statutes creating the board were unconstitutional and an injunction against the collection of taxes for the support of the school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizens sought a declaration that the statutes creating the board were unconstitutional, alleging that they unlawfully granted of the power to tax to the board, whose members were appointed rather than elected. The trial court dismissed the suit and the court affirmed. While the language of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 34-53(1963) implied that the board could levy a tax, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 34-55(1963), expressly negated such an implication by stating that the statute did not authorize the board to levy or collect any tax, but the city council, upon the demand and under the direction of the board, would annually levy all school taxes. Further, the restriction of art. 34 of the School Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, art. 34(1963), to cities having a population exceeding 500,000 was constitutional because it was based upon exigencies found in such metropolitan areas and did not create local or special legislation. Finally, art. 34 was not an arbitrary delegation of police power and governmental functions to a board nor did it repose unregulated discretion in an appointive board, as the board's functions and powers were expressly defined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, which sustained appellees' motion to strike the citizens' complaint for declaratory judgment and for injunction, denying them leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint, and dismissing their suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner of a tract of land sought a special use permit to allow construction of a hospital. After a hearing, the permit was recommended by the zoning commission, but the municipal board of trustees denied it. In affirming an order which overruled the action of the board and that directed that the permit be issued, the court held that a hospital was in the residual category of special uses. The court noted that both the commission and the trial court found that a hospital would not be incompatible with other uses in the neighborhood and would not have an adverse effect upon them. The evidence clearly supported those findings, and the record was devoid of proof that a hospital would cause depreciation in the value of adjacent properties. The denial of a special use permit had to bear a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Neither a preference for a publicly financed hospital or a fear of potential economic disadvantage to other hospitals were proper considerations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city treasurer appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Marion County (Illinois), which dissolved an injunction previously granted by the trial court against defendants, the city and its governing officers, and entered an order finding the Industrial Building Revenue Bond Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-74-1 et seq., and an ordinance constitutional in all respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The treasurer brought an action to restrain the holding of a referendum election to approve or disapprove the issuance of revenue bonds authorized by the Act. The complaint alleged that both the Act and the city's ordinance calling the election were unconstitutional and that the expenditure of public funds to defray the cost of holding the referendum would therefore be illegal. The trial court granted a temporary injunction, but after defendants had answered and evidence was heard, the trial court dissolved the injunction and entered an order finding the Act and ordinance constitutional. The treasurer appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in considering the constitutional issues presented by the parties because it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter presented by the complaint. The court held that the courts had no right to interfere with or prevent the holding of an election which was one step in the legislative process for the enactment or bringing into existence a city ordinance. The court held that it had no power to render advisory opinions, and until the legislative process had been concluded, the controversy was not ripe for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners argued that: (1) Ill. Rev.

Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The broad guidelines embodied in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 7-2.1, were as specific as they needed to be, and were consistent with an effective legislative plan for the changing of school district boundaries. With or without the consent of the inhabitants of the school district, even without notice or hearing, the state was allowed to take the school facilities in the district and vest them in other districts or agencies. The trial court correctly held Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 7-2.1, was applicable to the special charter school district since by its terms it applied to all special charter districts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and several co-defendants were charged with the victim's murder.

Defendant asserted that his confessions were the result of coercion by the police, and that the existence of one of his confessions was not revealed to him in violation of statutory law. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction by the trial court. Defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment and Ill. Const. art.

Defendant told the police where to find guns hidden in the basement of his home and his brother consented to the search when the police arrived at the home. The trial court's admission of the confessions into evidence was not an abuse of discretion based on the record.

The court noted that the City had to have an express grant of authority from the general assembly to enact ordinances unless the power was necessarily implied in or incidental to power or powers expressly conferred. In this case there was no express grant of authority and the City argued that the ordinances necessarily flowed from a series of enactments that allowed the City to license electrical contractors, plumbing contractors, heating/air-conditioning contractors, masons, and boiler operators. The court disagreed. The court concluded that the existence of such enumerated statutory power had just the opposite effect and precluded the regulation of contractors in fields other than those to which the City had been given express regulatory power. The City's ordinances attempted to cover every contractor who had anything to do with a building or structure and were an attempt to add links into its chain of power that were not supplied by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village filed a petition to levy a special assessment for storm sewers. Objections were filed on the ground that the ordinance upon which the special assessment was based did not describe a local improvement and that property outside the village would have been benefitted. The trial court agreed, and dismissed the petition. The village filed a motion to vacate the order and grant a new hearing, which was denied, and the village appealed the decision. The court noted that where the complaint was merely that the power had been exercised without legislative authority, no attack being made on the statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 9-2-140 (1961), itself, direct review could not have been had merely because parties affected call it &quot;unconstitutional&quot;.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff police officers filed an action seeking to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance and rules promulgated by defendants, the City of Peoria (Illinois) and its police and fire chiefs, which authorized defendant city manager to assign police officers and firemen to do work for other departments. The officers appealed after the Circuit Court of Peoria County (Illinois) granted defendants' summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City's ordinance authorized the city manager to assign police officers to fight fires and fire fighters to perform police-related duties. The chiefs promulgated departmental rules to implement the ordinance and offered training so that their employees would be able to perform the assigned tasks if necessary. The officers unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the ordinance; they claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was beyond the express powers granted to the city, was inconsistent with state law, and was contrary to public policy. In affirming the summary judgment entered for defendants, the court held that the Illinois Municipal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 1-1-1 et seq. (1961), conferred ample authority upon the City to prescribe the duties of the police and firemen and to assign them to duties in other departments. The City's powers under the Code were cumulative to other powers it possessed; the City was acting pursuant to the State's legislative direction. The court looked to state statutes, governmental practice, and judicial decisions to determine public policy; the ordinances and rules did not violate Illinois's public policy.</SPAN></P>

The Commission's liens were based on old age assistance payments and a &quot;medical capitation&quot; charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contended that &sect; 8-19 of the Public Assistance Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23. para. 819 (1961), which allowed the Commission to impose liens on causes of actions initiated by its recipients, created an arbitrary classification because it provided for charging only those personal injury judgment creditors who were on relief and did not include other plaintiffs who recovered such judgments. The court upheld the trial court's order. In so holding, the court found that: (1) the constitutional guaranty of equal protection did not prevent the adjustment of legislation to differences in situation, but required merely that the classification was to be based on a real and substantial difference having a rational relation to the subject of the particular legislation; (2) &sect; 8-19 was not unconstitutional for failing to require a connection between an accident for which recovery was had, and the public assistance appellant had received; and (3) the trial court properly included the full medical capitation charge in determining the amount of the lien.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant corporate taxpayers filed a class action seeking to enjoin appellee county tax collector from distributing personal property taxes collected from the taxpayers. The taxpayers claimed that they were discriminated against because they were assessed and billed separately for tangible and intangible property taxes. They appealed after the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the complaint for want of equity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, paras. 498, 502 (1959) provided that the taxpayers' personal property taxes would be assessed and billed by local authorities, but that their intangible property taxes would be assessed and billed by the state. The taxpayers did not dispute that the total amount that they were billed for these taxes was correct, but claimed that &sect;164 of the Revenue Act of 1939, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 645 (1959), prohibited the local and state taxing agencies from generating separate tax bills. The taxpayers claimed that they were discriminated against in violation of their equal protection rights and the Illinois Constitution because they were singled out to receive two separate tax bills. In affirming the dismissal of the suit, the court held that the generation of two tax bills did not violate statutory or constitutional law. Although the Act prohibited the taxpayers from receiving more than one tax bill for their personal property taxes, it did not prohibit the state from generating a separate bill for intangible taxes. The local assessor was not required to include the state's intangible tax assessment in the taxpayers' locally assessed tangible property bills.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered judgment for the appellee and the Appellate Court, Fourth District (Illinois), dismissed the appeal, holding that validating legislation rendered the case moot. The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The disputed community unit school district included property outside the corporate limits of the City of Decatur, Illinois and also included three islands completely detached from each other and totally separated from the unannexed portions of the district. The court held that the issue for consideration was whether the annexation and its attendant separation of the remainder of the territory of the district from which the tracts were detached violated the constitutional mandate for a &quot;thorough and efficient&quot; system of schools prescribed by Ill. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 1. The court invalidated the legislation in question. The court held that, where the legislature could not constitutionally create a school district of noncontiguous territory or authorize boundary changes that would leave a district with noncontiguous territory, it followed that it could not validate a school district so created or changed. The court therefore reversed the judgments below and remanded the case to the trial court for the entry of a judgment in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The objectors contended that the 1963 act amended the Code in a manner contrary to the constitutional prohibition contained in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. That constitutional section stated that no statute shall be amended by reference to its title only, but the section amended shall be inserted at length in the new act. The court held that &sect; 3-1 dealt with annexation of territory to park districts. The new section also dealt with the disconnection of territory. It did not amend &sect; 3-1 and did not purport to do so. It simply added a new section to the Code, article 3 of which dealt with annexation and disconnection of territory.

The division between elementary schools and high schools was found historically in the education system of the state and it was not unconstitutional to provide funds to one without providing similar funds to the other. The court also rejected the town supervisor's claim that the distribution violated Ill. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The village enacted an ordinance that required the village to license each scavenger operator within its limits. The ordinance further stated that only two operators were licensed each year. The scavenger operator received a letter informing him of the ordinance and requesting that he cease operations and apply for a license next year. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held among other things that the village had the authority to license the operators and limit the number of licenses issued each year. The court rejected the scavenger operator's contention that the licenses were prematurely issued and that he was deprived of an opportunity to apply for one because it did not bear on the validity of the ordinance and did not provide a basis for an injunction totally restraining the enforcement of the ordinance. The scavenger operator next alleged that the two licenses were issued to &quot;nonentities.&quot; However, the court found that the scavenger operator cited no authority that indicated that the other operators' failure to register under the assumed-name statute precluded the right to receive a municipal license.</SPAN></P>

The judge assessed a fine lower than the amount prescribed by para. 229a.

The judge contended that the schedule of fines in para. 229a was directory and that he was vested with discretion in assessing the amount of the fine. The court granted the writ. The court held that para. 229a was mandatory and that the judge, upon the determination of guilt, had no discretion or authority beyond assessing a fine according to the statute. The court reasoned that the legislature intended to provide for a fixed and inflexible schedule of fines for truck overweight violations, which had to be applied upon a finding of guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county school board transferred territory from one school district and annexed it to the acquiring school district. The losing school district filed an action in the trial court under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, paras. 264-279 (1961), one month later, to challenge the board's decision. The acquiring district filed a motion to dismiss for failure to file within 10 days of the decision as required by ch. 122, para. 7 --7. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint. On the losing school district's appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the right of appeal was not essential to due process, but that the legislature's power to provide for appeals was limited by the exercise of reasonable bases for discrimination or classification of types and times for appeal, and that the strict 10 day period for appeal of board actions versus more liberal time for other appeals had no reasonable basis and was, therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer's action had alleged that Ill. Rev.

The taxpayer contended that the acts violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19 by providing extra compensation to public servants after their service had been rendered. The court held that the acts were constitutional. The acts allowed a teacher to decide whether she would make payments so that she could receive the supplementary payments. Thus, the voluntary nature of each teacher's participation meant that a contractual relation between a teacher and the state was created when he or she elected to participate. The court also held that the supplementary payments were similar to insurance annuities. The relationship being contractual, the teachers' rights were not measured as pensioners. The court also held that the contributions required of a participating teacher had a reasonable relation to the amount of payments provided to her so that the amount of contribution did not change the contractual relation.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the trial court enjoined further collection of the tax upon sales of the kind involved in the dispute and reserved jurisdiction for the purpose of ordering the refund and return by the Director of any and all amounts paid under protest. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly declared the provisions unconstitutional, pursuant to Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. In pertinent part, the court determined that the amendments were unconstitutional attempts by the legislature to bring occupations essentially of a service nature within the ambit of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. Thus, the court held that the trial court's decision was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a county collector and a town, challenged an order of the County Court of Macon County (Illinois) sustaining appellee park district's objections to the application for judgment for taxes assessed against certain real and personal property owned by the district. The property had been found exempt from taxation under &sect; 19.18 (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 500.18) of the Revenue Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 500 et seq. (1959).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The park district was a municipal corporation with less than 500,000 inhabitants. Appellants claimed that the property should not have been exempt and that the trial court erred in finding &sect; 19.18 of the Revenue Act to be constitutional. The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) section 19.18 of the Revenue Act was plain and unambiguous because it exempted from taxation all property of every kind belonging to a park district of less than 500,000 inhabitants without regard to its location or use; (2) the district was placed squarely within the provisions of the exemption provided by &sect; 19.18, so any further showing as to qualification for exemption of district property was obviated; (3) the district's burden of showing that the property was within the exemption statute was discharged by a stipulation of counsel, so the burden shifted to appellants who contended the statute granting exemption was unconstitutional as special legislation in violation of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 (1870); and (4) &sect; 19.18 was not unconstitutional because there was no affirmative showing that the legislative action was clearly unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the exemptive provisions of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, Ill.

(1961), as amended by Senate Bills 564 and 565 (Laws 1961, pp. 1738 and 1772) were unconstitutional and void, and severable from the acts which they amend, and that Rule 38 of defendant director of internal revenue (director), interpreting said acts, was void and of no effect. The trial court granted the director's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action and for want of equity. On appeal, the court held that plaintiffs alleged sufficient facts to establish their interest in the controversy, thus coming within the requirements of the Declaratory Judgment Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 57.1 (1961). The court concluded that the exemption from tax was provided for a person organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, or educational purposes and limited to sales by such person to its members, students, patients, or inmates of tangible personal property not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for profit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the bulletins and rule issued by the director enlarged an exemption contrary to the amendatory sections in question and were hence void.

The driving schools contended that the provisions of the School Code that conferred authority on the boards of education to provide driver education to persons over 21 were unconstitutional. The boards of education successfully moved to dismiss the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the School Code, particularly &sect;&sect; 10-22.20 and 27-24, permitted the boards of education to offer driver education classes for persons over the age of 21 who qualified for classes in those districts. The court noted that &sect; 10-22.20 had to be construed with the other provisions of the School Code, and found that the legislative scheme provided a means for persons over 21 to overcome educational deficiencies. The court determined that &sect; 27-24.8 authorized the superintendent to promulgate rules and regulations for the administration of the Driver Education Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 122, para. 27-24.1 et seq. (1961). The court found that nothing in the Code or the Act prohibited boards of education from offering driver education to adults.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners, who owned an apartment building in the city, filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment holding that &sect; 78-15.9(b) of the Chicago Municipal Code (code) was invalid. For many years the code provided that in all multiple dwellings there had to have been at least two public vertical means of exit leading to the main exit level of the building, accessible from each dwelling unit. Previously, the secondary means of exit for certain apartments could have been by access to a second stairway through another apartment, provided that the door between the two apartments was equipped with a glass panel having a certain size and strength. Section 78-15.9(b) provided that the glass panel doors could not have been used in any building as a secondary means of exist after a certain date. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which held that the ordinance was invalid as applied to buildings in which such doors had been legally installed under the provisions of previous ordinances.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decree. The court held: 1) that the city had the power to proceed in equity even in the absence of &sect; 23--70.3 of the Act and therefore the owners were not unconstitutionally deprived of their jury trial right; 2) that laches did not apply and no estoppel could be claimed because the owners had never verified the building's code compliance themselves; 3) that the testimony of the responsible building authority was sufficient to establish proper notice; 4) that the city could require changes in existing buildings for the protection of health and safety; and 5) that the bathroom requirement was presumed valid and had a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank alleged that it, as a national bank, was an instrumentality of the federal government and, therefore, exempt from the disputed tax under Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 120, para. 441 (1953). In this classification the court saw no arbitrary discrimination. The court held that the reason behind the exemption did not require that the exemption extend to privately owned enterprises where no reduction in governmental costs would result. There was neither allegation nor proof in the record that the repealed exemption operated to the benefit of any privately owned corporation chartered by the state that could reasonably be classed with national banks. The court concluded, therefore, that the exemption of the proceeds of sales to the state and to local government did not discriminate against national banks. Therefore, the trial court erroneously held that the Retailers' Occupation Tax discriminated unconstitutionally against national banks during the period that the exemption was in effect and its decree was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner owned a three-story building that contained seven apartments. The owner was notified to reduce the number of apartments and discontinue use of the third floor for living quarters. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected the owner's argument that he had a constitutionally protected right to continue his nonconforming use of the property. The failure of the trial judge expressly to rule on the constitutional issues raised by the owner did not preclude direct appeal to the court. The court held that the owner's use of the property was not one that existed lawfully. The owner having built in violation of law could not benefit by such illegal conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which dismissed his amended complaint against defendant county challenging the elimination of the office of township collector and the county's subsequent collection and disbursement of certain funds, stemming from the elimination of that office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer brought suit against defendant county challenging the elimination of the office of township collector and objecting to the accumulation and disbursement of certain funds by a county commission, stemming from the elimination of that office. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss and plaintiff was allowed to file an amended complaint. The essence of plaintiff's amended complaint was that defendant's action in regards to certain funds was unlawful and beyond the authority of the acting commission. Plaintiff sought injunctive relief restraining defendant from accumulating and transferring certain funds. The lower court granted defendant's motion to strike the amended complaint for want of equity, holding that plaintiff's remedy, if any, existed under the Revenue Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120. Plaintiff appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that plaintiff's suit was not timely and was a belated attempt to convert a court of equity into a forum for the trial of tax objections contrary to Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18. The court characterized plaintiff's arguments as absurd and found his constitutional arguments to be void of merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decree of the lower court that dismissed plaintiff taxpayer's complaint against defendant county. The court found that the complaint generally lacked merit, was untimely, and that remedies, if any, for his allegations of illegal taxes, existed under state statute and not in a court of equity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was present when his co-defendants struck the victim, took her to another location, and raped her. Defendant claimed he got disgusted and left after he was asked if he wanted intercourse with the victim. The victim died as a result of her wounds. Defendant was found guilty of murder and the court affirmed. It rejected defendant's claim that he was just an innocent spectator as he did more than just see the co-defendants commit the crime; instead, he was present at the commission of a crime without opposing it. Further, defendant provided no other reasonable explanation that for the group's activities and, as such, there was an inference that he participated in a common understanding and design to have sexual relations with the victim against her will. The fact that the group might not have intended to bring about her death cannot relieve them of their legal responsibility. Further, it was not error to admit photographs of the victim as she was found and those taken at the morgue because they showed the condition of the victim's clothing and bruises on her body and were admissible for showing the amount of force used.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant taxpayers appealed the orders from the Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), which entered judgment on a jury verdict in an eminent domain proceeding on remand after two earlier appeals. The court consolidated the current appeal with an appeal from an order of the trial court that denied a petition by the taxpayers and others for leave to file a taxpayer's complaint for injunction against condemnor school authorities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On this appeal, the taxpayers sought to challenge orders issued by the trial court to implement the mandate of the court in an earlier appeal. The taxpayers again raised challenges to the validity of the taking. The court held that no point that the taxpayers raised or could have raised in a prior appeal on the merits could be raised on this appeal, and those issues not raised were waived. The court held that the proper question was whether the orders were in accordance with the mandate and directions of the court. The court held that a purported challenge to the jurisdiction to the trial court was merely an attack on the powers of the condemnor, which was a nonjurisdictional matter that had been waived by the failure to raise it at the proper time. On the taxpayers' petition, the court held that the trial court had discretion to grant the petition, grant or deny it in part, or deny it entirely. The court examined the calculations set out in the petition and the proposed complaint, and held that the pleadings contained errors and failed to show a violation of the debt limitations found in Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 12, or in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 113, para. 44 (1961).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the orders of the trial court that implemented the eminent domain judgment against the taxpayers and that denied the taxpayers' petition for leave to file an action to restrain and enjoin the disbursement of public monies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a purchaser of special assessment liens from a city, sought review of a decision from the Appellate Court, Second District (Illinois), which found in favor of defendant property owners and reversed a decree of a circuit court. The circuit court had granted to the purchaser a final decree foreclosing the liens and directing the sale of the real estate parcels of the property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city levied special assessments against the parcels of the property owners, and in 1951 the city offered the liens for sale. The circuit court granted the request of the purchaser of the liens to foreclose on the liens in 1961, but the appellate court reversed on the basis that the five year statute of limitations, passed in 1957 and contained within &sect; 84-56a of the Illinois Revised Cities and Villages Act (Act), later codified at Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 9-2-70 (1961), barred the action. The court reversed, finding that the retroactive application of &sect; 84-56a of the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the alteration of the purchaser's right by subsequent legislation was void because it impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution. Procedural or remedial statutes, such as the creation or change in a statute of limitations, were not to be construed retroactively where to do so would deprive an owner of a vested property right. The court ruled that special assessment liens were vested and valuable property rights, and such property rights could not be taken away without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the appellate court and affirmed the decision of the circuit court. The decree of the circuit court to foreclose the liens on the parcels of the property owners and to order of the sale of the parcels, at the request of the purchaser of the liens, was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A child was born to complainant in Germany. A German court found that appellant was the father of the child and ordered him to pay support. Complainant later came to the United States, married another man, and settled in Wisconsin. Appellant also came to the United States, married another woman, and settled in Illinois without ever having lived in Wisconsin. Appellant contended that the warrant of the Governor of Illinois was invalid because it was in conflict with the demand and supporting papers, which showed that appellant had never been in Wisconsin and was therefore not a fugitive from that State. The court stated that the supporting papers and the Wisconsin Governor's demand were not in conflict because they were based on the allegation that appellant was charged with conduct in Illinois that resulted in his commission of a crime in Wisconsin. Appellant also contended that he was not subject to extradition since he was not in Wisconsin at the time the crime was allegedly committed and was therefore not a fugitive from that State. The court concluded that States had the power to provide for the extradition of persons who were not fugitives in the technical sense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission filed condemnation proceedings against the taxpayers. The awards were deposited with the treasurer, and he was authorized to withhold from the awards money to cover taxes on the land. He was also authorized to withhold funds to cover the second half of the taxes. The taxpayers filed petitions to prorate their taxes relying, on &sect; 28.1 of the Revenue Act of 1939 (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 120, para. 509.1 (1961). The trial court dismissed the petitions. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the phrase in &sect; 28.1, &quot;transferred for a use exempt from taxation under the Act, included a transfer to a municipal corporation whose property was necessarily exempt from taxation under the Act by reason of ownership alone. The commission was a municipal corporation falling within the category of those whose property was exempt from taxation under &sect; 19.15 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. chap. 120, para. 500.15 (1961), because of its ownership The compensation to be paid to the taxpayers when their property was condemned had to be fixed by the valuation of the property at the time of the filing of the petition.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that certain parts of the Du Page County, Ill., Du Page County Liquor Control Resolution were invalid. On review, the issue raised was whether or not an ordinance licensing bartenders was reasonably necessary to make effective the specifically delegated power to license retail liquor establishments, and to establish such further regulations and restrictions upon the issuance of and operations under local licenses not inconsistent with law as the public good and convenience might have required. The court held that because of the comprehensive nature of the licensing powers, and the specific powers of prohibition granted by the Illinois Liquor Control Act, it could not say that the licensing of bartenders was reasonably necessary to effectuate the specifically granted powers of the municipality. Therefore, the court held that the county board was without the power to enact the provisions of the local liquor control ordinance relating to the licensing of bartenders.</SPAN></P>

The village plan commission recommended the proposed motel.

The trial court declared the zoning ordinance unconstitutional as applied to the property owners' land. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the denial of the proposed use was unreasonable because the evidence presented regarding a detrimental aura surrounding the proposed motel was too uncertain or minimal to restrict the construction of the motel. The court noted that the character of the boulevard in question in the vicinity of the property was commercial. The court held that the presence of single-family residences to the west of the property and a nearby high school did not make it reasonable to prohibit the proposed motel which was entirely within the commercial character of the area.</SPAN></P>

On review, the trial court reversed and allowed the claims, holding, among other things, that the amendment to the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act was unconstitutional in that it embraced a subject not expressed in its title in violation of Ill.

The department of revenue argued that the circuit court improperly held that &sect; 2a of the Act was unconstitutional. The department also claimed that under &sect; 2a of the Act the lessee had to file a claim with the department before it could bring an action seeking a refund of the taxes that the lessor had collected. The court did not address the constitutionality of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant owned property where it wanted to build a ready-mix concrete plant in a district zoned for industrial uses and adjacent to where another company already operated a large ready-mix concrete plant.

The building commissioner denied the application, and the zoning board of appeals affirmed denial of the permit. The trial court had issued a writ instructing the village to issue the permit. The court modified the judgment of the trial court and affirmed it as modified. The court held that: (1) even though in form the ordinance was an ordinary zoning restriction, in its operation and effect it excluded from the village all ready-mix concrete plants except that of the company that had already received a permit; (2) the ordinance did indirectly what it could not do directly; it permitted a monopoly to exist; (3) the ordinance was unconstitutional because it created a monopoly; and (4) the judgment of the trial court was overbroad because it struck down the entire ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 127, paras. 213.1 - 213.14, and an act declaring it a public interest for the authority to construct a building for the attorney general's use.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to dismiss the action for want of equity, which was allowed. The trial court then entered a decree declaring that the acts were not subject to the constitutional objections raised. The citizen appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. A separate corporate entity, such as the authority, was not an arm of the state merely because it leased property to the state. The fact that the general assembly appropriated money to pay rent did not create a debt. Moreover, the issuance of bonds by the authority did not create a debt against the state. Thus, the Act did not violate Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18. Assuming that the Act in some way permitted the state to lend its aid or credit to the authority, the furnishing of adequate office facilities for state government was a public purpose and a proper expenditure of state funds. The claims that the Act violated Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 26 and art. II, &sect;19 were founded upon the false assumption that the bonds created a debt against the state. The Act did not impliedly authorize suit against the state, or leave the bondholders without a remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Cook County Criminal Court (Illinois) that convicted him of the sale and unlawful possession of marijuana, that imposed a 10-year prison sentence for his sale conviction, and that imposed a two to 10-year prison sentence for his possession conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal of his convictions, defendant argued that the evidence established the defense of entrapment and that there was a material variance between the indictment and the evidence. Defendant also argued that the statute under which he was sentenced was unconstitutional because it imposed a penalty that was disproportionate to the nature of his offenses. The court upheld defendant's convictions and sentences. The evidence failed to establish that defendant was entrapped into committing the sale offense by an informer. There was no material variance between the indictment and the evidence; the indictment charged that defendant sold marijuana to an undercover police officer, and the evidence established that defendant delivered the narcotics to the undercover police officer, whom he knew was buying and paying for them. Finally, the court upheld Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 192.28-38 (1959). There was no proof that the penalty provided by the statute was disproportionate to the nature of defendant's offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order convicting and sentencing defendant for the sale and possession of marijuana was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.5(b) (1957). The building owner requested reimbursement of payments he made to the contractor's employee under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee of the contractor received a workmen's compensation award from the building owner for permanent loss of vision in his eye that occurred while he was working on the owner's building. The trial court dismissed the building owner's complaint against the contractor for reimbursement of those payments because the complaint was filed more than two years after the employee's injury. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that the building owner had a right of subrogation to the claim of the employee pursuant to &sect; 5(b) of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.5(b) (1957). The court held that as a subrogee, the building owner could not assert the claim against the contractor because pursuant to &sect; 14 of the Limitations Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 15 (1959), he had been subrogated to a right which had been barred by the two year limitation period. The court noted that the subrogee could have no greater rights than the subrogor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant adjoining property owners sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which granted a motion by appellee rezoning applicants to vacate a judgment in favor of the adjoining property owners in their action contesting the rezoning of land as commercial property. The applicants filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rezoning applicants entered into agreements to sell their property, subject to rezoning of the premises for commercial purposes. The adjoining property owners protested the rezoning, then filed a complaint when the city council declared the ordinance passed despite the fact that it did not receive the favorable vote of two-thirds of the council. The trial court ruled in favor of the adjoining owners. The applicants' motion to vacate the decree was granted, the adjoining owners sought review, and the applicants filed a cross-appeal. The court reversed and remanded. Under the protest statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 73, 8 (1957),discretion as to what the law should be rested with the municipal authorities. Although the effect of a written protest was to require a greater percentage of the vote of a municipality's governing body, no delegation of legislative power resulted. The adjoining owners' protest was sufficient to require a two-thirds vote of the council. The trial court was not justified in vacating its decree. When the zoning was tested for reasonableness, a debatable question was presented. The question of rezoning belonged to the city council, not the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff congregation sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, on administrative review, affirmed the action of defendant Board of Appeals of the City of Chicago (board) in denying the application of the congregation for a special use permit pursuant to the city's zoning ordinance. The congregation wanted to use contiguous store buildings as a church.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The congregation applied for a special use permit pursuant to Chicago, Ill., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 8.4-4 to use two contiguous store buildings as a church. The property was in a B4-2 restricted service district. A church was denominated a special use, which was allowed in B4 districts only pursuant to the variation provisions of Chicago, Ill., Zoning Ordinance art. 11. The board denied the application, finding that the proposed church was not necessary for the public convenience, and that such use would cause substantial injury to the neighborhood's property values. On appeal, the congregation argued that the ordinance as construed and applied in this case was unconstitutional and that the refusal of the special use permit was arbitrary and capricious. The court agreed and reversed the order. It held that right of freedom of religion rose above mere property rights and above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest. Denying the congregation the right of worship at this location, upon speculative fears of traffic congestion, bore no reasonable relation to the general health, safety and welfare, nor was the church more harmful to business continuity than the other permitted uses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded with directions to order the issuance of the special use permit to the congregation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county brought an action against the property owners seeking to enjoin them from operating a business in a residential district in violation of an ordinance. The property owners asserted for a defense that the ordinance was unconstitutional and void. The property owners filed a counterclaim seeking an injunction against the county to prevent it from enforcing the ordinance. The trial court granted a judgment in favor of the property owners on all issues. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that the property owners were not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance because the county instituted the action against them and to compel the property owners to seek such relief would have been a patently useless step. The court found there was sufficient evidence that the residential classification contained in the ordinance was arbitrary and unreasonable where the evidence revealed that 70 percent of the land in the area was devoted to nonresidential uses. The court concluded that the gain to the public was small when compared to the substantial hardship it would impose upon the property owners.</SPAN></P>
