The court vacated defendant's conviction and held that the superior court's failure to properly instruct the jury on each of the essential elements of the offense charged affected defendant's substantial rights under Me. R. Crim. P. 52(b). The confusion created by the error in the initial instructions was compounded by the superior court's repeated incomplete and inaccurate attempts of reinstruction, thereafter. A verdict based on a misconception of the law was against the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff unsuccessful bidder sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, Androscoggin County (Maine), which dismissed its complaint upon a decision to affirm defendant State Purchasing Agent's award of a state contract for the lease of photocopying machines to defendant successful bidder rather than to plaintiff. The court also had denied plaintiff's motions for an evidentiary hearing and for leave to depose the Purchasing Agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, plaintiff contended that it was entitled as a matter of law to a trial of the facts, and to conduct discovery, pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 11006(1) (1979) and Me. R. Civ. P. 80C, and that the lower court erred in failing to find the State Purchasing Agent's decision arbitrary and capricious. The court, however, disagreed and accordingly affirmed. The State Purchasing Agent's interpretation of plaintiff's bid was reasonable; under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 1816(7), it was clear that the additional capabilities of the copier defendant proposed to supply could be taken into account by the State Purchasing Agent in determining which bid was actually the lowest. The court then addressed plaintiff's contentions that he was entitled to conduct the deposition and to have an evidentiary hearing. The assertion that the State Purchasing Agent and the principal of defendant were &quot;social friends,&quot; without more, did not constitute a sufficient showing of prejudice to entitle plaintiff to take the deposition. Moreover, there was no abuse of discretion in the determination that the taking of additional evidence was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), that affirmed the decision of the Maine Board of Commissioners of the Profession of Pharmacy (commission) that denied his application for registration to practice as a pharmacist in Maine under the reciprocity provision of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 2902 (Supp. 1983-1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, a registered pharmacist in Massachusetts, applied to the commission for registration to practice in Maine under the reciprocity provision of &sect; 2902. The commission denied the application, finding that Massachusetts did not require as high a degree of competency for original applicants as Maine did because it did not require a bachelor's degree from a school that was accredited by the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education (ACOPE). The trial court agreed with the determination. The court affirmed. The commission reasonably concluded that the educational difference demonstrated a lower competency requirement. It considered that the applicant's qualifications may have exceeded the minimum required for registration in Massachusetts and determined that his specialized graduate program was no substitute for a general accredited pharmacology bachelors program. Section 2902 was not an unconstitutional delegation of a legislative function to ACOPE, a private organization, because it was appropriate to incorporate by reference ACOPE's accreditation process, which had significance independent of the legislative act.</SPAN></P>

The landowner alleged a taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a town road was permanently closed, appellee had requested that a private way be established across the landowner's land. The referee had found that the private way was not a necessity or a common convenience because it only benefitted the landowner. The landowner contended that the private way constituted a taking under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3006, and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for judgment to be entered for the landowner. Given that the referee found that the private way across the landowner's property was not required by necessity or common convenience, an unconstitutional taking resulted and Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 3006, and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, were violated. In light of the application of Me. R. Civ. P. 80B in cases involving government agencies' action or inaction, it was not outside the lower court's jurisdiction to appoint the single referee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Cumberland County (Maine), which convicted of him cruelty to animals, a violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 510 (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of recklessly depriving his horse of necessary sustenance. As a specific condition of probation, he was required to pay restitution to the Maine State Society for the Protection of Animals (MSSPA) for the expenses incurred in nursing the horse back to health. Defendant appealed the legality of the sentence. In affirming, the court held that the MSSPA was an authorized claimant for restitution because restitution was authorized for &quot;victims&quot; of crime, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1324(1) (1983), and it was clear that if reasonable charges for the horse's care were incurred, the MSSPA would be a &quot;person&quot; who suffered economic loss, pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 2(20), and was authorized to make a claim. Defendant's argument that the payment of restitution would create an excessive financial hardship on him and was therefore not authorized was without merit because it was clear that the superior court considered the factors in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1325(2)(D)(1-5), in determining the sentence. The court held that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1204, which authorized conditions of probation, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators ran establishments that served liquor and offered amplified musical entertainment. Among other things, the challenged ordinance prohibited amplified music. It also required applicants for amusement permits to post a bond naming the town as beneficiary. The operators filed their action seeking a declaratory judgment that the ordinance violated their due process rights under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, as well as U.S. Const. amend. I and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. They argued that the bond constituted an invalid tax. The trial court entered a summary judgment for the town, and the operators appealed. The court held that the ordinance was enacted in substantial compliance with state law. The court ruled, however, that the ordinance was not a proper exercise of the police power and that the bonding requirement exceeded the town's statutory powers. The court ruled that noise control was a proper subject for exercise of the town's police power, but that the other stated purpose for the ordinance, to decrease the attractiveness of bars, was not. Moreover, the town's ban on all amplified music, whether loud or not, was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

The board found the children to be truant. The trial court found that the parents committed a civil violation for being in control of habitually truant children. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the state's responsibility for education of its citizens justified the requirement that parents seek approval of home education plans. The court ruled that &sect; 911 did not violate the parents' constitutional rights because it did not prohibit home education, but merely required approval of their proposal. The court noted that the parents never submitted a home education plan; thus, the school board could not consider their request and did not deny the parents' asserted right. The court found that prior approval of home education plans was a reasonable requirement and not unconstitutional, rejecting the parents' self-incrimination argument as not applicable to a civil violation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court, Penobscot County (Maine), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment against him that charged defendant with having in his possession or under his control some firearms, a violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 393.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been previously convicted of grand larceny, which was punishable by one year or more imprisonment. He was subsequently indicted for possessing or controlling firearms. The court vacated the order of dismissal of the indictment. The trial court determined that if defendant was prosecuted under the then-current law for the larceny committed in 1961 then he could not be convicted of a crime punishable by one year or more imprisonment. Thus, he would have presumably been beyond the reach of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 393 because the Legislature did not intend for &sect; 393 to apply to past convictions for crimes that would not be punishable by one year or more imprisonment. Further, if &sect; 393 were construed to be applicable to defendant's case, then the statute as applied would have been unconstitutional for the imposition of a bill of attainder in violation of defendant's constitutional rights. The trial court's first basis for dismissal had been rejected in a recently decided case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court, Penobscot County (Maine) that convicted him having a firearm in his possession or under his control in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 393, which prohibits a person who has been convicted of a crime punishable by one year or more imprisonment from owning or having in his possession or under his control any firearm without a permit from the Commissioner of Public Safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1962, without the assistance of counsel, defendant pled guilty to felony theft. He was discharged from probation. In 1981 he was found in possession of two firearms without the requisite permit. On appeal, the court found no error. Although defendant's underlying offense was no longer punishable by one year or more imprisonment, as required by the version of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 393 on which he was charged, the statute was to be interpreted broadly and not constricted within narrow channels. Therefore, defendant's conviction of an offense, which, at the time of conviction, carried a punishment within the terms of &sect; 393, brought him within the class of persons covered by &sect; 393. The application of the statute was not an ex post facto application of the law and did not violate either U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 or Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because there was a sufficiently rational connection between a defendant's past conviction of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or more and the protection of the public against indiscriminate use of firearms by that class of convicted persons. The court held that defendant could not collaterally attack his 1962 conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners contended the town's zoning ordinance was facially unconstitutional because it improperly delegated discretionary authority to the Board to regulate land use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners brought their action against the Board after the Board denied petitioners' request for a zoning use exception for construction of multi-unit apartment buildings within the town. The relevant ordinance granted the Board discretionary authority to grant exceptions. Petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance which vested in the Board absolute power to determine if the proposed use would adversely affect the health, safety, or general welfare of the public and whether the petitioned use would alter the essential characteristics of the surrounding property. The court on appeal reversed the trial court's judgment affirming the Board's denial decision based on its determination that the local ordinance improperly delegated legislative authority to the Board and was therefore void. The court noted that the general language of the ordinance did not provide sufficient guidance to meet constitutional requirements required to guide the discretion of the Board's enforcement authority in granting and denying use exceptions. The zoning ordinance failed to provide the Board with a basis for determining that petitioners' use was unsuitable.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court stated that compliance with the prerequisites set forth in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1312(6) was prima facie evidence of blood-alcohol level in any court and subsequent changes in police departmental regulations did not render the test results inadmissible. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that his defense was hampered because he was charged under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1312-B, which used the disjunctive &quot;or.&quot; Finally, defendant attacked the constitutionality of Maine's drunk driving law, which created both a criminal, (Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department disallowed certain depreciation expenses claimed by the nursing home in connection with its purchase of the facility.

On appeal by the Department, the court reversed the judgment of the superior court and affirmed an administrative decision upholding the Department's determination. The Department used the $ 75,000 tax-return figure as the depreciable basis for the facility after its transfer; the court held that this was consistent with the spirit and purposes of the federal and state Medicaid regulations, even though the transactions involved did not come precisely within the letter of any particular regulation. The court ruled that the nursing home's depreciable basis for Medicaid purposes could not exceed that of the seller.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On January 14, 1981, the employee sustained a back injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realty company commenced proceedings against the town inhabitants to establish title to two parcels of land. The realty company had been owner of record in the early 1930s. In 1934 through 1937, the town recorded tax liens against the property in question. The town conceded that because the realty company was a non-resident owner of the land enforcement of the liens was unconstitutional and did not divest the realty company of its title. The town, however, argued that it established title by adverse possession and that the realty company lost the ability to maintain the action after the company dissolved it corporate status in 1979. The court affirmed the directed verdict rendered in the realty company's favor. The realty company filed its articles of dissolution in July of 1979, which terminated the company's corporate existence. Enactment of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 13-A, &sect; 1122(1) (1981) changed the common law, however, and provided for the survival of lawsuits by and against dissolved corporations. There was no distinction between lawsuits pending at the time of dissolution and suits brought after dissolution. The statute was designed to ensure the survival of both.</SPAN></P>

The teachers' association submitted the teacher's dismissal to grievance arbitration.

The board appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in finding that the dispute over the teacher's dismissal was arbitrable under the collective bargaining agreement between the board and the teachers' association. The court ruled that the final decision on substantive arbitrability was the function of the court and not of the arbitrator. Further, the court held that the collective bargaining agreement included a general agreement to submit to arbitration any grievance still unresolved after the formal levels of grievance procedure. The court affirmed the decision confirming the arbitration award, concluding that the dismissal of the teacher was an arbitrable grievance under the collective bargaining agreement.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 23, &sect;&sect; 1901-1925 (1980). The company appealed, and prior to the superior court's decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held the Act unconstitutional. The legislature repealed the Act and re-enacted it in amended form to meet the First Circuit's objections. The Department sent the company a new sign removal notice under the re-enacted Act, and the company obtained a stay of the Department sign removal proceedings from the trial court. The company argued that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling required the superior court to vacate the decree ordering the removal of the sign, and the court agreed. The court found that the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the First Circuit's decision that the Act was unconstitutional, and that such a ruling did not permit the superior court to elect to enforce particular portions of the Act that it deemed severable and constitutional. The court found no manifest injustice in ordering the vacation of the Department's order because it was seeking to enforce a statute found violative of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action for breach of contract between two companies, the main issue addressed was whether the trial court erred in granting the declaratory judgment in view of the fact that when the action was commenced, there was already pending in the federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico, an action between the same parties that would settle all the factual and legal issues presented. The court found that the record gave no clue to why the trial court thought that a useful purpose would be achieved by granting the declaratory judgment. The court held that comity should have been accorded to the federal court in Puerto Rico and the action there permitted to run its course without the intrusion of a Maine declaratory judgment. The court found that it was an improvident exercise of discretion for the trial court to entertain the declaratory judgment action. The court vacated the case and to ensure that the dismissal would have no res judicata effect on the action in the federal court, the judgment of dismissal was to be entered expressly without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1941, the city constructed its airport with federal funds. In its agreement, the city promised that the airport would at all times be operated for the use and benefit of the public during its &quot;useful life.&quot; In 1959, the city received additional funding for runway resurfacing and land acquisition. Nine years later, the city entered into a confidential option agreement with a corporation to purchase the airport. The company paid $ 10,000 for the option, which was amended and extended from time to time. After several unsuccessful attempts by the city to secure a release, the Federal Aviation Agency notified the city in 1980 that it could dispose of the airport. After agreeing with the trial court that the taxpayers had standing to bring its action seeking to declare the option agreement null and void, the court then upheld the judgment in favor of the taxpayers, holding that the option agreement violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1349(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, which prohibited the exclusive use rights of any landing area or air navigation facility upon which Federal funds have been expended.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant business owner challenged an order of the York County Superior Court (Maine), which dismissed the request of plaintiff, Town of Kittery, Maine, for injunctive relief but fined defendant for violating Kittery, Me., Obscenity Ordinance (1980) in his daily live entertainment shows. The trial court denied the business owner's counterclaim for an injunction and held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the Town's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner claimed that the ordinance was facially overbroad, in that it prohibited activity protected by the First Amendment, and that it violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the Town's ordinance carefully restricted its prohibition to offensive conduct contemplated by the United States Supreme Court in Miller. Further, the ordinance on its face applied only to obscenity and did not infringe upon any interests protected by the First Amendment. Thus, in the court's view, the business owner's facial overbreadth challenge to the ordinance failed. The court also rejected the business owner's claim that the terms &quot;lewd,&quot; &quot;profit,&quot; and &quot;commercial enterprise&quot; were vague. With regard to the business owner's claim that the ordinance impermissibly discriminated against commercial enterprises, the court held that there was a rational basis for prohibiting only those enterprises from presenting obscene exhibitions. Patently, the Town could rationally have decided that prohibiting commercial enterprises from featuring obscenity would foster greater results in eliminating a perceived evil.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that the use of public funds in the manner contemplated by defendants' agreements would amount to taxation for private purposes in violation of state and federal constitutions, that the state's incurrence of debt for the corporation's benefit was a lending of the state's credit prohibited by Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 14, and that the issuance of bonds for the project was not authorized by the state's electorate as required by art. IX, &sect; 14. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment, although on different grounds than the trial court. The court determined that plaintiffs had standing to seek an injunction against state funding of the project as violative of Me. Const. art. IV, part third, &sect; 1, and art. IX, &sect; 14. However, the court rejected plaintiffs' challenge to the validity of the referendum on the project and held that its questions did not mislead voters. Further, the court held that the project's indirect benefits to the state's economy constituted a public purpose sufficient to validate the project's subsidy to private enterprise.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed a judgment of the Oxford County Superior Court (Maine), which affirmed the county commissioners' decision to deny an abatement of the landowner's property taxes in defendant town. The landowner had appealed to the superior court pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 844 (1978) and Me. R. Civ. P. 80B, arguing that the Chase Law, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect;&sect; 563, 564 (1978), applied to his assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county commissioners concluded that the landowner had failed to meet the burden imposed by the Chase Law of showing that the tax created an incentive to abandon the land. The superior court affirmed, and on appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the evidence before the county commissioners was sufficient to support their denial of a tax abatement. The court did not find it necessary to reach the landowner's constitutional arguments. Noting that the issue was whether there was compliance with the Chase Law, the court found that the issue presented an evidentiary question. To qualify for an abatement, the landowner had to show that notwithstanding efficient operation of the land, the land's after tax annual net return was inadequate in the light of the risks involved and that the tax burden created an incentive to strip or abandon the land or otherwise operate contrary to the public policy declared in the statute. The court found that the commissioners were not compelled to reach any other conclusion than that the landowner had failed to meet his burden of proof. Although the commissioners did not make specific findings, the landowner did not challenge the failure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, town, building inspector, and members Durham Zoning Board of Appeals, appealed the order of the Superior Court, Androscoggin County (Maine), which enjoined the town from enforcing its mobile home ordinance against plaintiff owners, who had sought a permission to move their mobile home to land they owned in town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners sought to move their mobile home from a mobile park to their property, which was not zoned for mobile homes. The trial court held that the broadly construed grandfather clause of Durham, Me., Ordinance &sect; 4, rendered the ordinance, Durham, Me., Ordinance &sect; 6(c), unconstitutional because of the breadth of its grandfather clause, and enjoined the town from enforcing the ordinance so as to prevent the owners from moving their mobile home. The court disagreed with the trial court. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the meaning of terms in a zoning ordinance was a question of law for the trial court, such that it did not have to accept the commission's interpretation of the ordinance; (2) an administrative construction of an ordinance or statute was never conclusive upon the trial court; (3) the courts had to construe legislative enactments so as to avoid a danger of unconstitutionality; and (4) under the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions, the town ordinance bore a reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare and was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or discriminatory based upon the reasonably foreseeable future.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the commission's decision, rejecting the land company's arguments (1) that the administrative decision was not supported by substantial evidence of record; (2) that the continuous and long-term use of the lands at issue as a commercial forest constituted a pre-existing nonconforming use that the controlling statute,&nbsp;Me.

Moreover, the terms required a minimally acceptable level of performance in similar circumstances by American dentist generally.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty, which the trial court accepted with allocution deferred at the request of defense counsel to sentencing. During the sentencing hearing the trial court became convinced that defendant denied possessing any culpable mental state, and the trial court then rejected the plea and set the matter for trial. In affirming defendant's conviction the court first held that the trial court redeemed its breach of Me. R. Crim. P. 11 by canvassing defendant about the plea at sentencing and acted properly in belatedly rejecting her plea of guilty to the information after he had accepted her plea. Clearly the plea was not knowing and intelligent, and defendant's was not an Alford plea. Rejecting the plea did not violate any state or federal rule, statute, or constitutional right; on the contrary it vindicated the right of due process. Although the trial court erred in its instruction on justification under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 108(2), the error was harmless because the defense theory was accident, not self-defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was notified by the State in a letter that his driver's license was suspended for his refusal to submit to a blood-alcohol level test.

The licensee claimed that he requested, by telephone and by letter, a hearing on the suspension. The letter stated that the licensee was unable to comply with the 10-day period because of mental incapacity due to depression and inability to understand the consequences of his failure to so notify the State. The State rejected the request, and the licensee appealed to the trial court. The trial court denied the appeal and ruled that the 10-day period was constitutional and was not tolled. The licensee appealed and contended that the trial court erred in its finding that the licensee's disability did not toll the running of the statutory time period. The court affirmed and held that the statutory period was not unreasonable given the limited nature and significance of the action required of the licensee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an individual Maine dairy farmer and a Maine corporation whose members were Maine dairy farmers, all of whom produced milk for sale in Massachusetts, filed suit against defendants, the state tax assessor and the state treasurer, to contest an increase in the milk tax. Three groups of Maine producers of milk for the Maine market moved to intervene. The Superior Court (Maine), awarded damages to plaintiffs, and all parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The milk tax was levied on dealers, who could collect it from milk producers by deducting the amount of the tax from the purchase price. 1979 Me. Laws 452 provided for repeal of old Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 4505, which set a flat rate, and enactment of a new &sect; 4505 establishing a floating rate. The act was not to take effect unless the new tax was approved by a majority of &quot;certified&quot; Maine milk producers. On appeal, the court upheld the finding that the balloting process was so egregiously defective as to be invalid. 1979 Me. Laws ch. 452, &sect; 9 was unconstitutional on its face. The legislature surrendered its power of taxation by letting the producers by majority vote determine the form of the tax as ultimately imposed. Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9 plainly appeared to forbid the legislature from surrendering to the producers the final decision on the form and amount of the tax. By enacting 1979 Me. Laws ch. 452, &sect; 9 the legislature unconstitutionally surrendered its power of taxation. The remedial provision of the superior court's judgment was correct. The milk tax of five cents per hundredweight was still in effect and was the proper basis for determining plaintiffs' recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Franklin County (Maine), finding that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1106 was constitutional. The lower court issued a report pursuant to Me. R. Crim. P. 37A(b), which allowed defendant to pursue to an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of marijuana. Defendant argued that the presumption found in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 1106(3) had no rational basis because it created an arbitrary distinction between possession of one and one-half ounces of marijuana and a lesser amount, and that it required the finder of fact to apply the presumption, given proof of the basic fact. The trial court determined that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court discharged the report. The court held that a court should avoid expressing opinions on constitutional law whenever a nonconstitutional resolution of the issues rendered a constitutional ruling unnecessary. The policy of judicial restraint was compelling when questions of constitutional dimensions were brought before the court on report. The court concluded that resolution of the instant issue at the present appellate stage of the proceedings would fly in the face of the above policy consideration. It was noted that defendant could be acquitted of the offense and, thus, the constitutional issue would be avoided. Further, the resources of the judicial system would be better served by resolving the matter to a final judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Penobscot County (Maine), which convicted him of aggravated assault under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 208(1)(B) (1981). Defendant claimed that the statute under which he was charged was unconstitutionally vague, that the denial of his motion in limine to exclude the testimony of the six-year-old victim was error, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a six-year-old child in his household failed to respond to a fire drill, defendant showed the child what heat was and that &quot;it could really hurt you&quot; by passing the flame from a propane torch over her hand, causing a second degree burn. Defendant worked regularly with a propane torch and inferentially was acquainted with the fact that the torch was capable of burning human skin. Appealing from a conviction for aggravated assault under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 208(1)(B) (1981), defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court rejected that claim, holding that a person of ordinary intelligence could not fail to understand that it forbade the conduct for which defendant was criminally charged. The court also held that, given his familiarity with propane torches he had adequate notice using it as he had vis-a-vis the child made it a dangerous weapon within the meaning of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 2(9)(A) (1981). The trial court did not abuse it discretion in determining that, under Me. R. Evid. 601(b), the child was not incompetent to testify.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 4450-4508.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The benefits claimant contested Lewiston, Me., Rev. Ordinances ch. 13A, &sect; 13A-51(B) (1979) because it prohibited municipal assistance to property owners but not to renters. After losing in the trial court, the benefits claimant appealed. She secured partial relief. The equal protection challenge that the benefits claimant made under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 failed because there existed conceivable states of facts which justified the distinction. The Equal Protection Clause did not demand perfection or precision in governmental attempts to remedy economic ills. The city's general assistance overseer was a proper party to the suit, but the city's fair hearing officer was not. The Lewiston General Assistance Ordinance violated Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 4450-4508 because the statutes did not permit the city to implement a blanket policy of denial for mortgage payment assistance applicants. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 4504(3)(A) stipulated that need was the sole criterion for eligibility. The benefits claimant had established her need for such relief and was entitled to immediate aid. The superior court erred in denying it to her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment that found the Lewiston General Assistance Ordinance to be constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a separate action, the court invalidated the Maine Milk Commission's order establishing minimum retail milk prices. The case was remanded to the trial court but no further action was taken pursuant to the court's mandate. An emergency rule issued by the Commission was invalidated by the trial court. The legislature then enacted Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 2961, which adopted the minimum prices set forth in the Commission's emergency rule. The Commission then sued the grocers for selling milk below the minimum price established by &sect; 2961. The grocers argued that because the parties to the first suit had not complied with the court's mandate in that case for the trial court to determine the last valid order relating to retail milk margins that could govern minimum milk prices, the enactment of &sect; 2961&nbsp;unconstitutionally interfered with the judiciary's powers. The court held that &sect; 2961 did not violate Me. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 because it did not deprive the grocers of a judgment or affect claimed rights that had been adjudicated by the courts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the secretary of state and other officials of the State of Maine, sought review of a decision of the Superior Court, Kennebec County (Maine), which determined that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 246-A violated the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause by discriminating against plaintiffs, the class of owners or operators subject to the truck tax. Defendants contended that the truck tax was offset by domestic taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 246-A required owners and operators of foreign-based trucks using Maine highways to pay much higher permit fees than Maine-based trucks. The court rejected defendants' contention that the truck tax, which discriminated against interstate commerce on its face, was offset by registration fees and excise taxes that Maine imposed on its own domestic trucks. For a domestic tax to serve as an offset to a state tax that by itself discriminated against interstate commerce, the domestic tax had to be in some sense equivalent or complementary to the tax under attack. Excise taxes were similar to personal property taxes and could be used by municipalities for any purpose, not just for highway maintenance. The State had also entered reciprocity agreements with 45 other states pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2243(2) and had exempted foreign-based vehicles from the excise tax pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 1483(1). The court concluded that the State could not waive the right to impose registration fees and excise taxes on foreign-based trucks and then use such fees and taxes to offset an otherwise discriminatory tax on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The benefits were originally granted but upon the employer's administrative appeal the Commission held that the resignation was &quot;without good cause&quot; and the benefits were denied under Me.

On review the court held that imposing &sect; 1193(1) would result in a substantial interference with the claimant's free exercise of religion. As long as the claimant was sincere in his belief, there was no fraud committed against the state for the purpose of obtaining benefits. Even to prevent such fraud, a legitimate &quot;state interest,&quot; the state could not use a blanket denial of benefits but had to find a less severe means in restricting the claimant's rights.

The court affirmed, finding that there was sufficient evidence to find that defendant, knowingly or by conduct manifesting a depraved indifference to the value of human life, caused the death.

There was also evidence that defendant withheld food from the child for a significant time. Further, medical evidence of bruises and burns on the child's body was admissible, even though defendant offered to stipulate to the cause of death, as the testimony was directly relevant to defendant's state of mind and an objective assessment of the nature of his conduct, as well as his credibility and his defense of accident. Photographs of the child taken during his final hospitalization and a prior hospitalization were also admissible, as they established the existence of a consistent history of abuse for more than six months, were relevant to the issue of defendant's criminal culpability, and refuted the defense of accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff housing corporation, together with the State of Maine and the State Bureau of Mental Retardation, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court for Kennebec County (Maine), which affirmed a decision of defendant city denying the corporation an occupancy certificate to use property as a group home for retarded persons. The city cross-appealed from the superior court's order denying its motion to dismiss for improper venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation agreed to buy a house in a district zoned for single-family residential use. The corporation applied to the city's code enforcement officer for an occupancy certificate. The officer denied the application. The zoning board of appeals held a hearing and rendered findings of fact affirming the officer's decision that the proposed use could not be classified as a single family use under the city's ordinance. With the State and the Bureau, the corporation sought judicial review of the board's decision. The trial court entered an order denying the city's motion to dismiss the action for improper venue, and it entered judgment on the merits in favor of the city. The court affirmed the venue order because the State and Bureau acted in the capacity of public guardians of incompetent persons. The court affirmed the judgment because (1) Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 4962(1)(E) (1978) did not authorize unrestricted suspension of legitimate zoning regulations for nonprofit corporations serving state interests absent a showing of compelling need; and (2) the proposed group home did not qualify as a family use under the city's ordinance, which was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. Rule 80B review of action taken by defendant the State of Maine Department of Human Services under the Maine State Plumbing Code, which, as applied by the department, prohibited him from installing waste disposal systems to service two parcels of waterfront property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department denied the owner's applications for permits to install a septic and sewage system. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that affirmed the department's decisions. The owner contended that the department's application of the Maine State Plumbing Code was unconstitutional because Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 42 (1980), under which the Maine State Plumbing Code was promulgated, provided insufficient standards. The court concluded that the safeguards found in &sect;&sect; 42(1), 42(3) and Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect;&sect; 8055, 8058 satisfied the constitutional requirements of a lawful delegation of legislative authority. The court held that the department's interpretation and application of Table 9-1 of the Maine State Plumbing Code was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. The department's conclusion that the owner did not satisfy all the criteria for a variance, as set forth in &sect; 3.6 of the Code was proper. Although &sect; 36(2) on its face constituted an unlawful delegation of authority, the court noted that the owner also failed to satisfy &sect; 3.6(1), (3), and (4), which were valid provisions that independently expressed legitimate rationales for denying a variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute originated in negotiations between the school committee and employee unions. The parties were unable to agree upon a new labor agreement. One point of disagreement focused on a union proposal to limit the subcontracting of bargaining unit work. After the arbitration panel determined compromise language, the school committee sought review, and judgment was entered affirming the arbitration award and declaring Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 26, &sect; 965(4) to be constitutional. In affirming, the court noted that the arbitration award did not purport to limit the right to subcontract work. Rather, the award limited the impact of a decision to subcontract by prohibiting the discharge or layoff of any bargaining unit member as a result of subcontracting. That limitation clearly affected &quot;wages, hours, and working conditions,&quot; and the court concluded that the arbitrator's award was binding. The court also concluded that the provisions of the Municipal Public Employees Labor Relations Law, Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners alleged that a series of conveyances of real estate involving the land developers and the builders constituted the creation of a &quot;subdivision&quot; within the definition of that term in Me.

The homeowners sought a judgment declaring the alleged subdivision illegal and also equitable relief in the form of an injunction to compel rescission of the alleged illegal conveyances. The trial court interpreted the homeowners' action as a direct appeal from a decision made by the Board and dismissed the action for failure of compliance with the time requirement for the commencement of such an appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The girlfriend and boyfriend were convicted of murdering the girlfriend's former husband. The girlfriend confessed before and during trial. The boyfriend was convicted as an accomplice. On appeal the court set aside the murder convictions and affirmed the conspiracy convictions. The court held that the investigating officer violated the girlfriend's constitutional rights by preventing her from terminating questioning after she had originally waived her Miranda rights. The girlfriend's in-court admission alone was not enough to support the conviction because it was &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; of the illegally obtained out-of-court confession. The boyfriend's murder conviction as an accomplice also could not stand because there was not competent, properly admissible evidence against the boyfriend that showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the girlfriend had murdered her former husband. The Miranda warning given to the boyfriend, while not complete, was adequate and his incriminating statements concerning the conspiracy admissible. The girlfriend's illegally obtained confession did not bear on her conspiracy conviction and was therefore harmless as to that conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power company raised various issues on appeal from the decision and supplemental order of the PUC that disallowed a proposed rate increase, which was designed to increase gross revenues, authorized a smaller increase, and approved the substitute rates. With regard to a discount offered to all of its employees, the power company argued that the PUC was powerless to order the discount phased out because such state regulatory action was pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act, and, if not, violated Maine law. The court set aside the order to phase out the discount and remanded the issue to the PUC. The order to submit a plan phasing out the discount did not violate Maine law. Under the Electric Rate Reform Act, Me Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 91 et seq., under a finding that the discount unjustifiably inhibited energy conservation, the PUC had the authority to order submission of a proposal terminating the discount altogether. However, fairness demanded that the court sustain the constitutional challenge regarding a matter that the PUC brought forward for the first time by its order and that the power company had no reason to anticipate as being involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeal in part, including that part that raised issue as to whether the PUC's ordering a phase out of the employee discount violated the federal Constitution, and remanded the case to the PUC for further proceedings.

The real estate owner filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that the city's zoning ordinance and trailer ordinance were unconstitutional. The superior court upheld the zoning board's decision. The real estate owner appealed. The court held that the mobile home park was not necessarily a commercial activity, which would not have been allowed in a residential zone, and that the zoning board acted without authority in denying the permit in the residential zone.

The commissioner ordered the self-insured employer to pay 50 percent of the full benefits for the earlier injury. The superior court affirmed. The employee contended that no matter how the responsibility for compensation be apportioned, the amount should have been based on his 1977 average weekly wage, not his 1975 wages. The employer challenged the admission of a transcript of medical testimony taken before a different commissioner. The court held that injured employees could not be subjected to overall reduced compensation due to a change of insurers. Both insurers were ordered to pay 50 percent of the full wage benefits as reflected when the injuries occurred. Although the admission of the transcript was error as hearsay, it was harmless as the testimony was corroborated by the employee's account, by another doctor's deposition, and by several medical reports, which were all admitted without objection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The paper company and the helicopter company were sued by landowners in connection with an herbicide spraying operation. The state, acting through the Attorney General, commenced a civil action against the companies for violations of the pesticide laws. The companies moved to stay the state's action pending resolution of the landowners' action. The district court granted the companies' motions. The superior court dismissed the state's appeals because the appeals did not come within the exception to the final judgment rule. The court rejected the superior court's decision and held that the state's appeals fell within the separation of powers exception to the final judgment rule. The district court's stay of the state's civil action was tantamount to judicial interference with an exclusively executive function. The judiciary would be preventing the executive branch of the state from enforcing the pesticide laws for the benefit of the people.

Petitioner sought review of an order of the Kennebec County Superior Court (Maine) that denied his application for permission to participate in a release treatment program under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 104(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was placed in an institution for the mentally ill. Less than one year later, petitioner sought permission to participate in the mental health institute's supervised off-ground activities and to make unsupervised visits in the area with family members. The trial court determined that petitioner failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he could be released without likelihood of causing injury to himself or others as a result of his mental defect. The trial court therefore denied petitioner's application to participate in the release treatment program. While petitioner's appeal of the trial court's decision was pending, another application was made on his behalf for his participation in another release treatment program. The second release treatment program was of a more restrictive nature than the first program. The second application was granted. As petitioner had no right to insist upon the terms of the earlier program, petitioner's appeal from the dismissal of his application to participate in the first program was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were denied a permit to place a single-unit modular home on their property because a local zoning ordinance did not permit &quot;mobile homes&quot; to be located in the owners' district except within mobile home parks, subject to the local mobile home park ordinance. After the denial of the permit was upheld by the zoning board of appeals, the owners filed suit to challenge the zoning ordinance. The court held that the owners lacked standing to argue that the ordinances entirely excluded single-unit modular homes because the owners failed to allege that they had attempted to locate their home in a mobile home park or that the mobile home park ordinance would be enforced to prevent them from doing so. The court further held that the owners failed to rebut the presumption that the zoning ordinance was constitutional because they did not establish the absence of any state of facts supporting the need for the zoning ordinance, nor did they establish that the extended range of developmental flexibility of multiple-unit modular construction was an irrational basis for distinguishing between single-unit and multiple-unit modular homes in regulating their location under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The town filed a tax lien on the property, thereby creating tax lien mortgages on the property and commencing the running of the homeowners' 18-month redemption period pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 943. The town then sent a notice of the impending automatic foreclosure, which was unclaimed by the homeowners. The homeowners learned from reading a newspaper article that the town, considering the home to have been tax-acquired by the town, had decided to sell the home. The homeowners initiated an action for an injunction to prevent the sale of their home and to compel the town to accept payment of their property. The trial court found for the town, and the homeowners appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant applied to the Board of Environmental Protection for approval of his proposed construction of a trailer park. The governing statute,&nbsp;Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38, &sect; 481, contained a financial capacity requirement. The employee determined that financing was unavailable for the applicant's project and returned the application. The court upheld the dismissal of the complaint against the Department. Assuming that the returning of what was deemed to be an incomplete application could be taken to be reviewable because it constituted &quot;final agency action,&quot; such judicial review was not available under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 11001(1) because the applicant did not appeal within 30 days of receipt of notice of the agency's action. Any claim for injunctive relief was barred because the applicant made clear it was too late to salvage the project. The claim for money damages was barred because the Department was immune from liability under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 8103. The trial court erred in rejecting the applicant's motion to amend to add the employee as a defendant because the trial court lacked evidence on which to conclude that no cause of action existed.</SPAN></P>

The lower court held that pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 752, it had no power to review factual findings of the Board. The court agreed and held that the Board was not a proper party to an appeal from its own decision as it was purely adjudicatory and had no prosecutorial powers or enforcement responsibilities. The lower court could not review the Board's factual decision under a substantial evidence test because &sect; 752 provided that the Board's decision was final and binding. While Me. R. Civ. P. 80B provided for review of Board decisions, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 752 strictly limited the scope of review. Because plaintiffs did not allege that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction or acted unconstitutionally, the lower court properly dismissed the complaint. The APA did not supersede the limitations of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 752 because the APA judicial review did not apply to the Board's decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contended that the trial court erred in ruling that they lacked standing to suppress the items seized from a safe in their attorney's office. The State attacked the decision that the owners had standing to object to the warrantless search of a retail store, which sold the owners' gems on consignment. The search warrant was based upon an affidavit containing information from a former partner. Police believed that boxes of gem tourmaline disappeared while being transported from a mine the owners' once owned. Because there was no probable cause to believe that the seized tourmaline was contraband, the trial court ordered the property returned to the owners, except the items taken from their attorney's office. The court affirmed that part of the judgment granting suppression and return of items, but reversed the denial of suppression and return of the items found in the attorney's safe. The court held that Me. R. Crim. P. 41(e) provided that the seized property must be returned unless it was otherwise subject to lawful detention. The court also held that because a retail store invited the public to enter, it had not consented to wholesale searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a nuclear generating plant was shut down for almost 15 weeks while it underwent repairs, the utility supplied its customers with more expensive power from other sources, passing on the extra expense to its customers under certain fuel adjustment clauses of the utility's rules, on filed with the state public utilities commission. Several customers challenged these excess charges as illegal and discriminatory. The commission dismissed the customers' complaint on the grounds that no prospective relief could be granted.

After consolidating the actions, the court reviewed the record and concluded that the commission lacked power to revise a utility's rates and order refunds to its customers when the utilities began the administrative proceedings, and that authority could not be supplied retroactively by the passage of subsequent legislation. Because the commission's order dismissing the customers' administrative complaint was not unlawful, the court dismissed the customers' action for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The wife, who had been stabbed several times, stated that she knew she was going to die and that defendant had stabbed her. He appealed his conviction on various grounds and the court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant acted knowingly or intentionally or with depraved indifference. At a suppression hearing, the presiding justice found by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant had given the police permission to search for ammunition in his car. The finding was not clearly erroneous, and thus the court rejected defendant's argument regarding the denial of his motion to suppress. The judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding defendant's questions to medical experts because they were geared to elicit legal conclusions beyond the specialized knowledge of the experts. The judge had discretion to exclude provocation evidence under Me. R. Evid. 403. The jury instructions were proper because the judge followed the definition of adequate provocation in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 203(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured inmate received disabling injuries to his right hand and arm when he fell through a window while participating in a basketball game supervised by the prison staff. The injured inmate filed his action pursuant to a private resolve enacted by the legislature. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss, holding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the private resolve violated the equal protection clause and special legislation clause of the Maine Constitution. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded. A prisoner living under state custody and control, who was injured under circumstances alleged to constitute gross negligence or misuse of authority, was in a significantly different position from that of other persons injured by the state's ordinary negligence in areas routinely used by the general public. The State could rationally, because of the difference, decide to assume a greater responsibility for the prisoner's injuries. The legislature could waive sovereign immunity for as limited a class as it saw fit as long as the limitation was not arbitrary and there was equality of right to persons similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed a summary judgment granted by the Superior Court of York County (Maine) favoring defendant assessors in the property owner's appeal of the assessors' denial of his claim to a property tax exemption under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 653.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner purchased a house in Maine in 1976 and became a resident of that state a year later. Subsequently, he filed for a tax exemption pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 653 on the grounds that he was totally disabled and a recipient of a veteran's pension. The assessors denied the request because the owner had not been a resident of the state for 10 years as required by the statute. On appeal, the owner argued that the exemption was applied differently to equally classified veterans without a legitimate government purpose. The court held that the portion of the statute that required a 10-year durational residency to qualify for the tax exemption was unconstitutional because it placed a direct impediment upon veterans' constitutional right to travel. The court found that the 10-year residency portion of the statute could not be justified because there was no compelling state interest to be achieved by the classification; however, the court found that the portion of the exemption, which exempted veterans who had entered the military as residents of Maine, was constitutionally valid. The court held that the owner had no legal right to receive a tax exemption.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that under the Maine and United States Constitutions, the due process requirement was satisfied in probation revocation proceedings when criminal conduct in violation of probation conditions was proved by a preponderance of the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner provided topless female dancing at his tavern. The town enacted an ordinance purporting to regulate live entertainment offered in businesses licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, and specifically prohibited the actual or simulated displaying of any portion of the female breasts at or below the areola area. The owner sought an injunction prohibiting application of the ordinance as unconstitutional. The trial court refused to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance and held that the town did not unconstitutionally encroach upon speech or expression. The owner appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the fact that the topless entertainment may have occurred on a slightly elevated area designated a &quot;stage&quot; did not transform it into a live musical or theatrical production involving a sufficient communication to consider whether prohibition of such nude dancing was an unconstitutional abridgement of speech. The prohibition of the nude dancing was an exercise of powers conferred by the Twenty-First Amendment, which did not transgress the independent protections afforded speech or expression by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

The disposition of the case violated the juvenile's rights because he was not allowed to be heard concerning the proper disposition and the 24-hour sentence to the county jail was impermissible absent a suspended sentence to the Maine Youth Center. The evidence of verbal abuse of a police officer was insufficient to support the trial court's adjudication of guilt. The juvenile's language while engaged in the permissible activity of verbally protesting his sister's arrest was not so egregiously offensive and likely to provoke a violent response from the police officer as to forfeit the protection of the First Amendment. Assuming that the words and conduct would have been sufficient, if directed at some other person, to constitute fighting words, an ordinary police officer would not have been so taunted as to respond violently. As a police officer, he was trained to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary question presented was whether or not it was necessary for the county commissioners to make an express finding on their return that the selectmen had acted unreasonably in refusing to lay out the requested private way. The court agreed with the referee to the extent he held that an express recitation of the municipal officers' unreasonableness was not required in the county commissioners' return. The court held, however, that it was essential to the authority of the county commissioners to lay out a way that they in fact determine preliminarily that the municipal officers had indeed been unreasonable in neglecting or refusing to act. The court remanded the case for the superior court to take evidence on the very specific question of whether the county commissioners actually made a preliminary determination that the selectmen acted unreasonably in refusing to lay out the requested private way.The court concluded that the laying out of a private way here would have been constitutional.The court further found that the damages as fixed by the county commissioners were grossly inadequate.</SPAN></P>

In its opinion to the legislature, the court found that the bill violated neither provision. The provisions concerning the appointment of judges of probate merely specified the requirements for appointing officers to such positions if the legislature, in its broad authority to create a court of probate, elected to create courts of probate. Further, the bill would have effectuated the purpose of a 1967 amendment that repealed Me. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A high-speed chase occurred between defendant and a police officer. Defendant's vehicle finally went off the road and struck a tree. When the officer approached defendant, he was threatened. The Officer told defendant that he was under arrest and to place his hands over his head. Defendant fled and after a short foot chase, the officer apprehended defendant. On appeal from his convictions for escape from arrest and two counts of terrorizing, defendant argued that the trial court committed error in instructing the jury. The court vacated defendant's conviction for escape from arrest because the trial court failed to instruct the jurors on the requirement of submission to the officer's authority. Without an adequate instruction requiring the jury to address the question of submission, it was possible the jury convicted defendant without properly finding all the elements of an arrest. Regardless, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for two counts of terrorizing because the complaints against him, which alleged that he threatened to murder the same person to whom the threat was communicated, were plainly sufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Somerset County (Maine), which convicted him of criminal homicide in the second degree under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 202(1)(A) (Supp. 1976). Defendant alleged that the admission in evidence of the confession he made after his indictment and prior to the appointment of counsel violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel despite his knowing and intelligent waiver of that right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested shortly after the body of the victim was found. He was given Miranda warnings and taken to a cell. Although he declined to waive his rights, he did not request a lawyer. Later that evening, defendant requested to speak with a certain state police detective. The detective gave defendant his Miranda warnings, and they discussed other matters. When the detective suggested that it was late, defendant insisted that he stay. The detective asked defendant if he wanted to discuss the murder, and when defendant agreed, the detective advised him of his rights again. Defendant confessed to the murder, and his statement was reduced to writing. Before he signed the statement, he was read his rights again. On appeal of defendant's conviction, the court affirmed. The court held that neither U.S. Const. amend. VI nor Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 required a per se rule barring the admission of a post-indictment confession made after a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel. The court also rejected defendant's challenge to the admission of an in-court identification where the witness's out-of-court identifications were free from constitutional defects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former husband sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Androscoggin County (Maine), which divided the marital home purchased by the husband and plaintiff former wife in 1956, ordered the husband to pay alimony to the wife and maintain health and life insurance for her benefit, and ordered the husband to pay $ 1,000 toward the counsel fees in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the husband argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction to divide the marital property of the parties acquired prior to January 1, 1972, without a specific request in writing by both of them, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 722-A could be applied to pre-1972 property without raising any constitutional difficulty. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in creating a tenancy in common in the property, thus avoiding the significant hardship to the wife if the property were sold. Although the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the husband to pay alimony, it did in requiring him to maintain life and health insurance for the wife's benefit because there was no evidence of either the availability or cost of such insurance and the husband's ability to obtain and pay for it. The husband failed to raise his claim that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 722 (Supp. 1979) violated equal protection and could not raise it for the first time on appeal, and the trial court's allowance of $ 1,000 was clearly within its discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeal in part and denied it in part, vacated that portion of the trial court's judgment relating to the maintenance of insurance, remanded the matter to the trial court for the limited purpose of receiving evidence on that issue, and affirmed the trial court's judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner applied for a permit to build a deck within 75 feet of the shore on his shorefront property. Defendant town's building inspector denied the permit. The landowner then built the deck within 20 feet of the shore. Defendant zoning board of appeals affirmed the denial of the permit. The landowner and the town filed suit. The Superior Court, Lincoln County (Maine), granted summary judgment against the landowner, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court held that the deck violated the town's shoreland zoning ordinance and, exercising its equity jurisdiction, ordered removal of the deck and assessed a fine. The landowner's principal contention was that the deck was not a &quot;structure&quot; proscribed by the town's zoning ordinance. The court affirmed. The deck was 24 by 27 feet in size, enclosed by a wooden railing, constructed of lumber, and anchored to the land by concrete, and it obviously came within the intendment of the ordinance that prohibited &quot;all structures&quot; within 75 feet of the normal high water mark. The court found nothing even remotely raising a genuine issue as to any invalidity or impropriety in the adoption of the ordinance. While it may generally have been true that the granting of equitable relief on summary judgment was a rare occurrence, under the special circumstances of this case, the court held that there was nothing improper about the issuance of the order to remove the deck. Under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 4(3), the town, as the public body to which the fine inured, could properly sue in its own name to recover the fine.</SPAN></P>

After defendant released his mother and left, his mother summoned the police; defendant was arrested and was charged with and convicted of criminal threatening in violation of Me. Rev. Stat.

In affirming, the court concluded that, evidence of defendant's actions, together with his mother's testimony that she was &quot;scared,&quot; was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Further, the evident established that defendant acted knowingly and intentionally. Although defendant's statements were somewhat irrational, the threat uttered by defendant made plain his awareness that he was holding a knife against his mother's body.

Rev. Stat. tit. 32, &sect;&sect; 2717-2723.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act was enacted as compliance legislation with the Federal Power Beautification Act of 1965 and established limitations upon the type and number of outdoor off-premises advertising signs permitted along roadways in Maine. The Act made some of the company's advertising signs nonconforming signs. On appeal, the court affirmed and denied the company's appeal, holding that (1) the Commission was not required to take any formal action in order to implement per se a removal policy, (2) it would be irresponsible to nullify the completed amortization program on the ground that the Commission failed to make an initial formal choice on its removal policy, (3) the Commission's failure to formally decide on a uniform time period for removal of all signs did not require that the court nullify the entire amortization program, and (4) the State of Maine's decision to use the amortization program conformed with the requirements of substantive due process and was not an arbitrary or capricious action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court (Maine) that was made in favor of defendants, the inhabitants of the Town of Sabattus and others, in the applicant's case brought on the basis that the Sabattus, Me., Mobile Home Park Ordinance &sect; III(1), which limited to four the number of construction permits that could be issued each year per mobile-home park developer and per mobile-home park, was illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant challenged the illegality of the ordinance. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 1917 granted home-rule powers to municipalities. Moreover, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 4956 provided for municipal review and regulation of land subdivisions. The court rejected the contention that the repeal of &sect; 4956(3)(H), which required that a municipality determine that a subdivision would not place an unreasonable burden on the ability of the local government to provide municipal or governmental services, denied municipalities the power to enact regulations to regulate growth. The Court relied on &sect; 4956(2) and tit. 30, &sect; 1917 in making that ruling. Further, however, the court found that the ordinance violated the Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6-A and the U.S. Const. amend. XIV in that it denied equal protection and was arbitrary because it unlawfully discriminated against mobile-home development; by limiting mobile-home parks to four permits per year, it limited those parks to four new dwelling units per year. In contrast, any subdivision that was comprised of conventional buildings was faced with no such limitation. Apparently, there was no rational basis for the distinction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Superior Court of Knox County (Maine), defendant, who was 17 at the time of the alleged offense, was convicted of night hunting in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 2455. He appealed, arguing that excluding the offense of night hunting from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Stating that it appeared defendant was making an equal protection argument, the court noted that states were not required to establish juvenile court systems. In establishing a juvenile court, states were free to include or exclude offenses from the jurisdiction of that court. The purpose of the prohibition against night hunting was the conservation of wildlife, and the legislature could rationally have concluded that a person under the age of 18 who was guilty of night hunting was not in need of the rehabilitative processes of the juvenile court system. There was no constitutional infirmity in such a classification. Next, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 3101(3)(A), requiring dismissal of a complaint against a juvenile who had been charged as an adult, applied only when the offense for which the juvenile was charged as an adult came within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Finally, defendant argued that the mandatory three-day jail sentence in the night hunting statute was cruel and unusual punishment when applied to a person under 18. Because defendant had no constitutional right to special treatment as a juvenile, there was no merit to his contention.</SPAN></P>

The assessors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Assessors argued that the taxpayers were barred from a right of abatement of real estate taxes because they failed to file lists of their estates under Me.

Because the taxpayers did not receive reasonable notice as required by &sect; 706, the court held that they were not barred by their failure to file lists. The trial court did not err when it found the Referee's findings adequate to comply with its order and to support a judgment in favor of the taxpayers. The court found that the taxpayers established that the assessments were unconstitutional by showing that the methods by which the assessments were made had the potential for unequal apportionment, even if the assessments were in excess of just value. Assessments made with the potential for unequal apportionment of the tax burden violated Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband was ordered to pay weekly child support to appellee wife. After the wife obtained employment, the husband temporarily ceased payments and then resumed them at a reduced rate. The wife sought arrearages and the husband sought modification of his support obligation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband claimed that the appellate court's judgment violated the Equal Protection Clause by holding him primarily liable to support his children. Because the appellate court applied an erroneous legal principle, the court did not consider the husband's constitutional claim. The court held that the trial court properly considered the relative financial circumstances of the parents and did not abuse its discretion in ordering a reduction in child support payments. However, the court held that the trial court did not have authority to order a retroactive modification of child support. Accordingly, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the appellate court's judgment. The court found that jurisdiction over divorce was statutory and that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 752 (Supp. 1978) only authorized prospective modification of child support orders, subject to exceptions for the death, emancipation, or majority of the child and an order that was retroactive to the date an application for modification was filed.

It held that &sect; 1112(1) did not impose a burden on defendant to prove anything.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court adjudicated the juvenile guilty of burglary. At the disposition hearing, the juvenile court sentenced the juvenile to the Maine Youth Center for an indefinite period, which terminated no later than on his 18th birthday. The juvenile appealed. The Superior Court in Cumberland County (Maine) denied the juvenile's appeal of both the adjudication and the disposition. Again, the juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the juvenile maintained that the denial of his right to be release on money bail was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to release the juvenile on money bail. The court noted that releasing a juvenile to the custody of responsible person was more likely to assure his presence at trial than relying on the juvenile's own ability to obtain cash for bail. The juvenile also argued that he had a right to a jury trial at the adjudication under the Due Process Clause of the Maine Constitution. The court held that the Due Process Clause of the Maine Constitution followed the federal constitution and did not mandate jury trials for juvenile offenders. The court reasoned that the Maine Juvenile Code's adherence to the traditional goals of the juvenile justice system, rehabilitation and treatment, rather than punishment of the juvenile outweighed the juvenile's interest in a jury determination. The court rejected the juvenile's arguments that he was entitled to a grand jury indictment and that the disposition violated his equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the juvenile's case to the superior court with instruction to enter a judgment that denied the juvenile's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners acquired the property long before the current ordinance was enacted. The landowners argued that the ordinance was invalid because the town lacked authority to enact the ordinance and because the ordinance resulted in a taking without compensation. On appeal, the court affirmed but on different grounds. The court held that the cardinal rule in statutory interpretation was to void the constitutional issue. In doing so, the court held that the ordinance had prospect application only. The ordinance, as amended, was silent in regard to an intendment that it be applicable to parcels of land ownership of which was acquired prior to the effective date of the ordinance, or that it be applicable to bar a use previously available under its original terms, was required to be construed as limited in these regards to only prospective applicability. The court concluded that the amended ordinance could not validly apply to force the removal of a building on the landowners' property that was acquired prior to the enactment of the ordinance. To interpret the ordinance any other way would result in an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 361, violated Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8. The Superior Court, Hancock County (Maine) entered summary judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant approved the creation of a CSD. Both towns voted to accept the per-pupil sharing of costs that was permitted by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 361. For the first two budget periods, all operating expenses were apportioned between the two towns on the basis of their respective number of pupils attending CDS schools. For the third budget period, CSD expenses were allocated between the two towns largely on the basis of the Uniform Property Tax Law, while the remaining portion was allocated on the per-pupil basis. After the Uniform Property Tax Law was repealed, the CSD allocated its entire budget between the two towns on the basis of the per-pupil arrangement. Plaintiff brought suit to declare that arrangement and &sect; 361 unconstitutional. The court affirmed a judgment in favor of defendant. The taxation differential between the towns fell within the judicially recognized exception to the general prohibition against &quot;special purpose&quot; taxation in Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8. The higher tax burden placed on plaintiff's property taxpayers was proportional to a greater local benefit enjoyed by plaintiff and its residents as a result of the higher taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House propounded questions regarding whether a provision of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 979 et seq., the State Employees Labor Relations Act, was constitutional as interpreted by using Me. Const. art. VI, &sect; 3. The Court weighed three questions revolving around the validity of a &quot;fair share&quot; clause, which required payment by non-union employees of 80 percent of the normal member's dues. Specifically, did that provision violate the non-union member's freedom of speech? The Court found that the issue had already been addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States. Using their decision as a guide, the Court held that the subject of such a &quot;fair share&quot; clause was a matter ripe for collective bargaining and was not prohibited by public law. Nor was it a violation of any free speech right as the bargaining agent was required to bargain for both union and non-union members. The Court also found that a prior evidentiary hearing as to the amount of the fee required to be paid by the non-union members was not essential to the validity of the clause in the agreement requiring the payment as a contribution to the expenses of the collective bargaining agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court answered the House's questions regarding the constitutionality of appropriations bill provisions in the negative.</SPAN></P>

At trial, defendant had offered evidence that he was not aware that the firearm had been placed in his vehicle by a drunken acquaintance. The court ruled that the trial court did err in failing to provide an instruction regarding defendant's awareness of the control and possession of the firearm, noting that defendant could not be found guilty for possession of the gun unless his possession was voluntary. The court held that, based upon the evidence presented, the jury could have found defendant had not been aware of his control of the rifle.

Defendant challenged the conviction first contending that the provision under which he was convicted was unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that while the provision lacked a scienter recommendation, one could have been inferred from the provisions of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 10(4). The court extracted criminal negligence from &sect; 10(4), and included it as the minimum scienter requirement for conviction under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1314. With such an addition, the statute was constitutional. However, defendant then urged that the evidence failed to sustain the conviction, and here the court agreed. The findings of the trial court were unclear with regard to criminal negligence. Accordingly, there was a failure to find an essential element of the crime charged, and the conviction was subject to reversal.</SPAN></P>

The case was tried, jury waived, upon an agreed statement of facts, and resulted in a finding that defendant was guilty. Defendant appealed and claimed that &sect; 3451 was unconstitutional. He based his refusal to pay the renewal tag fee upon a contention that the dog licensing statute violated both the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the Maine and United States Constitutions, and he also asserted that &sect; 3451 represented an improper exercise of legislative power under the Maine Constitution. The court denied the appeal and affirmed the conviction. The court held that the State had a significant interest in regulating and controlling dogs, and a dog's potential for rabies and substantial violence generally set it apart from other popular domestic animals. As such, the court reasoned, the licensing requirement of &sect; 3451 was rationally related to such differences and bore substantial relationship to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.</SPAN></P>

The Senate propounded questions to clarify &sect; 15 and to prospectively ascertain the potential restrictions on persons elected as constitutional officers and their former partners. The court held that it lacked constitutional power to issue an advisory opinion. The Senate had no function or duty to perform with regard to the election of an Attorney General. Under Me.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former convict was convicted of murder in 1949, after he pled guilty at a probable cause hearing without the assistance of counsel. In 1968, he was released from prison after it was determined that the right to counsel attached at such a hearing. In 1969, he filed a complaint against the State, after the legislature had waived sovereign immunity by granting him a private resolve. The trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of the State. On appeal, the court instructed the trial court to vacate the order of summary judgment, to enter an order dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, and to grant leave to amend the complaint. The court held: (1) that the resolve did not create a new cause of action; (2) that the resolve did not violate the equal protection clause or the special legislation clause because it was highly improbable that there were other similarly situated persons being denied the privilege granted by the resolve; (3) that there was no basis for his claims of false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process because of his guilt; and (4) that he received no injury compensable under the State's jurisprudential system.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the appeal of one diver for lack of standing. Although the allegations of the complaint gave him standing to challenge the ordinance, his failure to appear at trial or otherwise prove that he was affected by the ordinance caused him to lose the right to appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant detainee was held as a fugitive from another state. He was held over a month without a rendition warrant, and thereafter pending the receipt of an extradition warrant. Upon receipt of that extradition warrant, which included a complaint stating that he committed a crime, appellant was ordered extradited. He sought habeas relief, claiming the extradition order was improper. Denied habeas relief, he appealed. The court rejected all three of his appellate claims. He first argued that the demanding state's documentation was inadequate owing to the lack of an affidavit; this claim was rejected on the grounds that there was no requirement of an affidavit as the demanding document. He next argued that his state's failure to make an independent probable cause determination was improper and that the claim was rejected under the doctrine of comity, with it being deemed enough that the demanding state certified that it had made such a determination. He lastly claimed that he was improperly detained without a rendition warrant. The claim was rejected on the grounds that the remedy for this admitted illegality was not dismissal of the extradition charges.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the strip search of the inmates after contact with non-inmates was reasonable. The court held that the hearsay exception of Ma. Rev. Stat.

The court held that because defendant was not prejudiced by the introduction of the marijuana, pictures of the marijuana, and the chemist's tests, the trial court did not err in refusing to sanction the State for failing to give notice of the evidence pursuant to Me. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(A). The court held that marijuana was clearly contraband because prisoners were prohibited from possessing it.</SPAN></P>

When the victim was at defendant's house visiting his daughter, defendant had sexual intercourse with her over her protests.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for statutory rape because &sect; 3151 did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution or the Maine Constitution. Section 3151 punished males for engaging in sexual intercourse with females under the age of 14, but did not similarly punish females for engaging in sexual intercourse with male under the age of 14. The sex-based classifications were lawful because they served important governmental objectives and &sect; 3151 was substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the town council was authorized under the town's charter to enact ordinances without submitting the subject matter to a public referendum.

However, the court remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of the town. The ordinance was not facially overbroad because the town's interest in preserving the quality of urban life and the aesthetic conditions in a tourist area outweighed any minimally protected First Amendment interest in nude dancing. The ordinance did not violate due process because it was not arbitrary or capricious in minimizing the commercial exploitation of nudity. The court also determined that the ordinance did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because there was a rational basis for permitting displays of nudity in theatrical productions while prohibiting such displays in the intimate atmosphere of bars and taverns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandson instituted an action, seeking compensation for injuries allegedly incurred due to the faulty construction of a lawnmower owned and operated by his grandfather. The lawnmower company that made the lawnmower filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted. The grandson appealed. The issue on appeal was whether an amendment reducing the age of majority applied to persons who would have been considered minors under the previous law, but who attained the age of majority prescribed in the amendment.. The court noted that the grandson was afforded six full years to assert his claim and that the lawnmower company had a sufficient corporate identity during its period of dissolution over which a Maine court could assert jurisdiction, thus the lawnmower company was not &quot;absent&quot; for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations. The court found that the grandson's claim against the lawnmower company based on retroactivity of injury and a tolling of the statute of limitations based on his past minority was not cognizable and affirmed the trial court's dismissal.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that it was rational for the trial court to decide either that defendant and the other prisoners did not engage in &quot;comparable criminal conduct,&quot; or that the prosecution of defendant was not based on an &quot;impermissible and unjustifiable standard,&quot; because the weight of the testimony established either directly or circumstantially that defendant was solely responsible for the murder. Further, the court held that because defendant made no claim in the trial court directed to his confession's trustworthiness or voluntariness, but objected solely on the ground that the confession was elicited without affording defendant the benefit of requisite &quot;Miranda&quot; protections, defendant failed to preserve any voluntariness or trustworthiness issue for appellate review.

The trial court ordered a decrease in rates to produce $ 1,900,000 less income. A justice of the court stayed the effect of the commission's order pending a determination on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company filed a revised schedule of rates to increase revenues. The commission denied the application and ordered the company to reduce its annual revenues. A justice of the court issued a stay of the commission's order pending review of the commission's decree. The court overruled the commission in part, sustained in part, and remanded. The court held that the commission improperly disallowed, as an expense, federal income taxes deferred by use of an accelerated depreciation instead of straight-line depreciation. The court stated the commission failed to give adequate consideration for the effect of a double leveraging adjustment upon 14 percent of the company's stock and improperly ordered the company to bear the costs of an external audit. The court also ruled, however, that the commission properly allocated a portion of interest owed to the company. The court stated that the commission correctly determined the cost of the debt to be 6.99 percent, and the company's cost of equity to be 11.5 percent. The court also sustained decisions regarding an attribution of a rate base, a working capital allowance, investment tax credits, and the company's charitable expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December, 1971, the wife was divorced from the husband and was awarded alimony. In June, 1976, the wife brought a motion seeking to recover arrearages of alimony. The husband asserted that the Maine alimony statute subjected divorced men to claims of alimony while not subjecting divorced women to similar claims. The issue was whether the discrimination denied the husband's class the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6-A. The court held that the discrimination had no rational relationship to any legitimate state objective and therefore denied the husband equal protection of the laws. In choosing between invalidation of a discriminatory statute or treating it as inclusive of an impermissibly excluded class, the court was required to ascertain and effectuate the predominant legislative purpose behind the statute. The court held that the dominant legislative purpose of the alimony statute, as it stood when this action was brought, was correctly served by treating it as extending eligibility to men as well as women.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to compel the billboard owner to remove signs erected along an interstate and other highways within the State between October 22, 1965 and January 1, 1968, without the payment of compensation. The billboard owner claimed that the statute upon which the State relied for authority to compel such a result, 1969 Me. Laws ch. 257, &sect;&sect; 2719(6) and (7), denied it equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in that the classification of signs erected between the specified dates differently from signs erected before those dates for which an owner would be entitled to compensation was arbitrary. The court set aside a judgment for the billboard owner. The &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test did not apply in determining whether the statutory classification was invidious because outdoor advertising did not involve either a &quot;fundamental&quot; interest or a &quot;suspect&quot; classification. A classification scheme that was adopted to further the State's legitimate interest in keeping the costs of controlling highway advertising to a minimum had some reasonable basis and did not offend the Equal Protection Clause because it resulted in some inequality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was sustained, the judgment was set aside, and the case was remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged error in admitting the blood test results, arguing that the results were obtained through the coercive effect of what he asserted was an unconstitutional statute because the provisions for suspending his license violated his due process rights by depriving him of that license without providing any prior notice or a pre-deprivation hearing. The court affirmed his conviction, concluding that the claim of unconstitutionality did not justify excluding the test results. The scientific evidence was obtained by a chemical test that was shown to have reliably indicated intoxication or sobriety. Excluding the test results would not have furthered any significant public interest. Defendant should have pursued his constitutional argument either by refusing to take the blood alcohol test and enjoining a threatened suspension or by appealing any license suspension that was actually effected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Ann. tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 2611(3) and 2661(1), under which he was bound over for trial as an adult, were unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 2611(3) listed the general areas of inquiry permitted to the juvenile court. Section 2661(1) merely provided for a de novo hearing on appeal if the criteria listed in &sect; 2611(3) were not met. The legislature properly imbued the juvenile court with great discretion in bindover cases. The statutes were not vague or overly-broad. Both hearings held by the juvenile court were transfer hearings, not adjudicatory hearings, and did not violate the rule of Breed v. Jones. The State was not required to prove that defendant had subjectively derived sexual gratification from the offense, only that the purpose of the offense was to obtain sexual gratification.</SPAN></P>

Shortly after midnight, the same warden observed them driving down a dead-end dirt road where deer were known to abound. After stopping the truck, the warden arrested defendants for &quot;night hunting.&quot; Defendants were convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The indictments, which alleged that defendants had unlawfully hunted wild animals other than raccoons one half-hour after sunset until one half-hour before sunrise of the following morning, were legally sufficient to charge the offense described in Me.

By expressly specifying as an element of the crime that the natural and probable consequence of a threat was either to place the person to whom the threat was communicated in reasonable fear that a crime would be committed, or to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly or facility of public transport, application of the statute was restricted to a kind of speech that produced or was likely to produce a clear and present danger of substantive evils that the State was constitutionally allowed to prevent. The indictment was not deficient for failure to allege a specific intent because tit. 17-A, &sect; 210 (1977 Supp.) did not prescribe a culpable mental state and no culpable mental state had to be pleaded or proved by virtue of the general rule in Me.

The legislature requested an opinion of the court as to whether the legislation violated Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8. The court found that the proposed legislation did not violate art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Penobscot County (Maine) convicting him of violating 17-A Me.

Ann. &sect; 204 for recklessly causing the death of another human being.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a juvenile when the crime was committed but had turned 18 when his guilty plea was accepted and sentence imposed. Since a juvenile citation had originally issued following the homicide, and a hearing had been held for the purpose of determining whether defendant should be treated as an adult, defendant argued that the juvenile statute, as then constituted, was unconstitutional because it did not provide for a transfer hearing separate from an adjudicatory hearing and, therefore, placed defendant in double jeopardy. The court found that when defendant entered his plea, he was aware of the theoretical double jeopardy defense. After defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment for a violation of 17-A Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 202 was denied, he entered his voluntary plea to the information charging a less serious crime. Having been convicted following a guilty plea, defendant could only appeal if the indictment was sufficient, the superior court lacked jurisdiction, or the punishment was excessive. The court found that although double jeopardy could be a defense to a criminal charge, it was not a constitutional impediment to jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried on two counts of assault and one count of disorderly conduct. The jury found him guilty on the assault charges and not guilty of disorderly conduct. The thrust of defendant's appeal from the judgments of conviction of the trial court (Maine) that followed the guilty verdicts on the assault charges concerned his asserted right to resist an illegal arrest with force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that trial court erred in refusing to rule as a matter of law that his arrest for disorderly conduct was illegal. From examination of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect;&sect; 108, together with Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect;&sect; 107 and 752, it was clear that the legislature did not intend Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, &sect; 108 to give a person the right to resist an officer's use of reasonable, nondeadly force to effect an arrest, whether legal or illegal. The court read those sections of the Criminal Code as an integrated whole declaring the entire law relating to criminal responsibility for violence during an attempted arrest. The legislature had cast the advantage on the side of law enforcement officers, leaving the person arrested in most cases to pursue his rights, not through violent self-help, but through prompt hearing before a magistrate with prompt consideration for release on bail or personal recognizance. The instruction requested by defendant, which stated a rule that was no longer the law was properly denied; the charge that was given correctly stated the principles of law relevant to the defense of justification. The remaining claims of error lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the power company filed a revised schedule of rates, the PUC used its suspension powers under Me. Rev. Stat.

Appellants filed both appeals and complaints, challenging the PUC's orders. In affirming the determinations, the court held that: (1) the PUC's order, issued within the suspension period, which fixed a new revenue increase level, prevented the power company's proposed rate schedule from being automatically implemented under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 64; (2) the court was not limited under Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 1742 was inapplicable because the statute required, as a pre-requisite for applicability, that it be alleged and proved that defendant had been previously convicted of a crime and sentenced to a state prison. Defendant contended that the &quot;previous conviction&quot; contemplated by &sect; 1742 meant a final conviction and not a conviction subject to or under appeal at the time of the commission of the current offense, which in his case was possession of a firearm by a felon. The court, however, dismissed defendant's appeal. The court found that defendant had a manslaughter offense in January 1965, of which he was convicted in June of that year. While the appeal from the conviction pended, defendant committed the firearm possession offense. After that charge, the manslaughter conviction was affirmed. The court applied the rules of statutory construction and determined that the former conviction, for manslaughter, was affirmed before the indictment under the habitual offender statute was rendered. The court also found that there was no equal protection violation by the prosecutor's decision to seek a separate indictment and to prosecute defendant pursuant to &sect; 1742.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission set the companies' federal income tax expense at a percentage that reflected their shares of the actual tax liability paid by a common parent corporation on a consolidated basis, instead of the 48 percent tax rate theoretically applicable to their separate income. The commission also: used the indebtedness of the parent and its subsidiaries, and made a comparison with other water companies, but not gas and electric companies, in setting a fair rate of return; reduced the amount allowed for management fees paid to the parent; refused to permit the companies to normalize accelerated depreciation on property acquired prior to January 1, 1970; disallowed depreciation on certain items of contributed property; and allocated allowable costs of the proceeding to affiliated corporations that were not parties. Three of the companies also challenged the commission's decision requiring the flow-through of accelerated depreciation on state income taxes. After holding that the companies' appeals and complaints were timely, the court determined that the commission's decrees were just and reasonable, and not an abuse of discretion, except for the disallowance of a minor adjustment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had left a one-half interest in the property to her son and daughter jointly. The testator's daughter filed a petition for a license to sell the property.

The decedent's son did not appeal the order granting the license pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect;&sect; 401 or 403 but, instead, filed an action in the superior court to set aside the sale. The parties agreed that the license was obtained in compliance with all expressly mandatory statutory requirements. However, Me. Rev. Stat.

Because the probate court's order did not conflict with the express terms of the notice statute, Me. Rev. Stat.

The petition alleged that he had committed acts on December 5, 1975 sufficient to constitute the offense of robbery with a firearm if committed by an adult. The juvenile judge ordered that defendant be committed into the custody of the Department of Human Services for six months. While in custody, defendant got in trouble and the juvenile judge rescinded the order. In September 1976 the grand jury returned an indictment charging that defendant had committed robbery with a firearm on December 5, 1975. At trial, defendant sought to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. The motion was denied. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court held that the superior court never acquired jurisdiction over him. The court found that once the juvenile court committed defendant to the Department of Human Services and defendant commenced to serve his term of custody, that court's jurisdiction over defendant terminated, and it could not thereafter rescind the adjudication and substitute a finding of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

The inclusion of the per diem incentive charges in net railway operating income did not cause a mal-apportionment violative of the Supremacy Clause or the Commerce Clause. &quot;Net railway operating income&quot; included the per diem funds. The per diem income was a credit to a railroad arising from the equipment rent of its general service railroad boxcars. The tax was not unapportioned. An apportionment formula was used.

The husband caught defendant and police found the victim's stolen items in the bag. Defendant was convicted for breaking, entering and larceny, in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 2103. Defendant appealed and contended that the evidence of a break was insufficient. The court affirmed and held that the testimony was sufficient to show that there had been a break in through the back door. Defendant argued that a jury instruction was in error when the jurors were told that they could infer that one found in possession of stolen goods was the thief. The court held that although the instruction was erroneous, defendant failed to object and he was not deprived of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All parties appealed from an order of the Superior Court (Maine), which held parts of two minimum pricing orders of defendant Maine Milk Commission invalid because they violated recent revisions to the Maine Milk Commission Law. Plaintiff dairy brought the action, pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 80B to challenge the Commission's first two orders based on the revised statute. A trade association and a producer cooperative intervened as defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Law was substantially amended by 1975 Me. P. L. ch. 517. The trade association sought reconsideration of the Commission's first order setting minimum prices for producers, dealers, and stores. The Commission issued a second order. The dairy sought judicial review of both orders. On appeal, the court concluded that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 2954 (Supp. 1976) required the Commission to conduct an independent investigation before issuing an order changing dealer and retail margins. The inquiry actually made by the Commission did not satisfy the statutory requirement. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 2954.2.B (Supp. 1976) required the Commission to determine the lowest prices at which milk purchased from Maine producers at minimum producer prices could be received in the state at a just and reasonable return, even if no Maine dealer operated at those prices. Then, the guidelines at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 2954.2 had to be considered. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 2954.1 authorized producer prices to be set on the basis of the Boston Federal Market Order and authorized passing the minimum producer prices through into dealer and retailer minimum prices without public hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirm the superior court's reversal of the Commission's orders to the extent those orders set dealer and retail margins. The court denied all the appeals from the superior court's order. The court did not order a remand of the matter as the Commission had begun a new round of investigation and hearings.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the Maine courts were without jurisdiction to entertain the inmate's petition for habeas corpus relief, on the ground that the inmate, who conceded that he had been fully discharged from any sentences imposed on him by the State of Maine, did not qualify under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5502 as a person convicted of a crime and incarcerated thereunder or fined.

In the husband's divorce case, the trial court found that, except for the wife's inherited one-third interest in the first parcel, both parcels were marital property. The trial court awarded the remaining two-thirds interest in the first parcel to the wife and awarded the second parcel to the husband. On appeal, the court held that the enactment of &sect; 722-A did not unconstitutionally impair any vested rights of the wife where it became operative when a divorce or separation proceeding was involved and where it did not prevent married persons from owning property separately during the marriage. The court also held that &sect; 722-A was not unconstitutionally vague where, in enacting the statute, the legislature recognized the need to give the trial court flexibility to fashion orders on marital property division which were appropriate to each individual case.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that since that was the law at that time, the one year period of redemption was as much a part of the mortgage then executed as though it had so stated in precise language of the mortgage itself. The court further held that the redemption provisions of Pub. Law of 1975, ch. 552, &sect;&sect; 6321-6325 were unconstitutional when applied to the mortgage because the mortgage was executed prior to the effective date of that statute. Absent specific language in the mortgage permitting foreclosure under any legal method existing at the time the mortgage went into default, the court held that the mortgagor was entitled to a redemption period under the law in effect at the time the mortgage was executed.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, ruling that the requirement that motorcyclists wear protective headgear had a rational relationship to the furtherance of the legislature's legitimate police power interest in promoting public safety and, thus, comported with the constitutional mandate of due process of law. The court also rejected the contention that the statute discriminated against motorcyclists in violation of equal protection guarantees, because the dangers to public safety posed by an unhelmeted motorcyclist greatly exceeded the dangers posed by an unhelmeted person in a car. Further, the court denied the claim that the protective headgear statute abridged defendant's freedom of speech, because the essence of the activity of operating a motorcycle was not &quot;speech,&quot; even if there was a nonspeech component, and could be regulated to promote the public safety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department store argued that &sect; 3204 was unconstitutional because it violated due process as it was overly vague and because it created a classification of stores that were permitted to be open on Sunday that was so arbitrary as to deny the department store equal protection of the laws. The court denied the department store's appeal, opining that the department store's claim that &sect; 3204 was vague was without merit, and that the distinction based on size between stores selling the same type of goods was not so unreasonable as to be arbitrary because the federal constitution did not require that things that were different were to be treated as though they were they same. Thus, the court found that the application of &sect; 3204 to the department store was constitutional. The court noted that the principle governing the &quot;void for vagueness&quot; doctrine was that a law would not be struck down unless business people of ordinary intelligence were not able to determine what business were exempt from the statutory prohibition, and that, applying that principal to &sect; 3204, it was clear that the exemptions contained in &sect; 3204 were not vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist pled guilty to driving under the influence, and an alcoholism counselor recommended sentencing as upon a first conviction. Respondent was notified of the conviction and suspended the motorist's license for three years because of two prior convictions. The motorist appealed and the lower court dismissed the appeal. The motorist appealed the dismissal, and the court dismissed that appeal. The legislature had entrusted the complete enforcement of the motor vehicle license suspension and revocation provisions of the law to respondent, to the exclusion of the judiciary except for statutory review of the administrative decision. The appellate review of respondent's decision in suspending the motorist's license to operate a motor vehicle under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2242, provided a complaint was filed within 30 days, was an adequate remedy in which the motorist as an aggrieved party could present for adjudication all issues in connection therewith, including the constitutionality of Me.

The revision was designed to achieve an increase in appellant's gross annual revenues. The appellant's rate schedule was suspended by appellee. Hearings then began on appellant's new schedule, but those hearings were postponed when one of appellee's three members retired. Appellee then stayed its proceedings, resuming them only when a third member was named. This postponement was a matter of significance since appellee's authority to suspend a rate schedule was for eight months, and, the suspension exceeded eight months. Appellee found that the proceedings had begun and had already been stayed, and that such a circumstance had the effect of stopping the eight-month clock that was ticking. After hearings resumed, appellant was denied approval of its rate schedule, and it appealed. The court reversed and remanded. Appellee's authority to suspend a rate schedule was limited to eight months, and a purported stay of the proceedings did not toll that deadline.

However, she subsequently decided not to do so and refused to communicate further with the seller. The broker contended that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 4056(1)(N) was unconstitutionally vague and that the trial court erred in affirming the Commissioner's determination that she violated &sect; 4056(1)(N).

The statutory terms used were neither so general that persons of common intelligence must guess at their meaning nor so indefinite as to defy evenhanded judicial interpretation.

The court ruled that the trial court did not err in refusing to admit evidence of the past convictions of the intended victim who was State's principal witness because such convictions took place 15 years prior to this trial. The court ruled that defendant was not deprived his right to a closing argument where his counsel was permitted to make an argument in support of his motion for acquittal at the close of the State's evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Superior Court (Maine), which affirmed a decision of a district court that convicted him of violating the state's disorderly conduct statute, Me.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Only a fine was assessed for the offense. Defendant paid that fine before he initiated his appeal. Relying on precedent, the court held that the appeal had to be dismissed because defendant had voluntarily paid the fine before filing an appeal. The court rejected defendant's argument that the amount he paid to the superior clerk was not payment of the fine, but was a &quot;deposit&quot; of the &quot;whole of the fine,&quot; pursuant to Me. R. Crim. P. 38(2). The court found that the rule was promulgated to address the issue of whether a court had power to stay a sentence to pay a fine. The court found that the docket entries in the superior court made no reference to a &quot;deposit&quot; but affirmatively stated that defendant &quot;paid&quot; the fine. Although Rule 38(2) would have allowed defendant to avoid imprisonment pending an appeal by making a deposit of the whole fine, it was clear that had paid the fine voluntarily before making any appeal. The presiding judge who admitted him to bail pending appeal acted too late. Defendant's voluntary payment of his fine terminated the action and left nothing on which an appeal could operate.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, because such motion was only intended to test the indictment as a sufficient charge of a crime and had nothing to do with whether the crime charged was sufficiently proved. Moreover, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of the evidence. To make a sale, the court said, only required that defendant believed he was selling a narcotic substance, not that he entertained a belief as to the exact identity of the drug being sold. Finally, it was not a violation of due process to subject defendant to mandatory imprisonment on the basis of the objective circumstance that he was selling LSD-25, where mandatory imprisonment was not required for mescaline, because the objective considerations were related to legitimate State penological interests.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that certain decisions were vested in the discretion of the commission, including a determination of proper accounting procedures and the interests of public policy. The commission rejected the study because of its accounting procedure. The court declared that it was unable to review the commission's decision because it was one vested in the commission's discretion. The court, however, examined the other reasons for the commission's rejection of the study and found them to be erroneous. The commission's decision to phase out rate inequities as a reason for rejection of the study was improper, thus the matter was remanded to the commission for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 556 be held null and void on the ground that its provisions for the determination of the tax rate involved a delegation of legislative power violative of Me. Const. art. III, art. IX, &sect; 9. The state officials sought to dismiss the action on the grounds that the municipalities (1) were not taxpayers, (2) collected the unconstitutional tax from the individual taxpayers, (3) retained a portion of the tax so collected by them for local school purposes, (4) made no effort to return any of the school tax collected by them to the individual taxpayers, (5) were not aggrieved by the setting of the tax rate, and (6) did not properly represent the interests of the individual taxpayers. In dismissing the action, the court held that the property owners were not entitled to have been repaid after voluntarily paying the taxes, and the municipalities gained no benefit under the law from an adjudication of the constitutionality of the State property tax and could not have retained the money. Thus, no claim entitling the municipalities to relief was stated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who owned a 30-acre parcel of land located in the town of Kennebunk, sought to use the parcel as a camping ground for transient camping vehicles and tenting. The Board voted to sustain the building inspector's denial of a permit to plaintiff. Plaintiff sought relief from the Board's decision. The court below ruled in plaintiff's favor, and the Board sought review. On appeal, the court concluded that the court below correctly held that tents and trailers intended for transient use by vacationers and campers were not &quot;dwellings&quot; as that term was used in &sect; 6.21 of the Kennebunk Zoning Ordinance. Thus, plaintiff's campground was not subject to the density requirements of that section. Further, the court held that, in disapproving plaintiff's permit, the Board failed to render its decision in accordance with the requirements of the Ordinance, adopted pursuant to the required comprehensive plan. The Board had not raised plaintiff's failure to comply with local health requirements as a reason supporting its disapproval of the plan. The court held that the Board's denial of plaintiff's permit was ultra vires and without force.</SPAN></P>

The foreign corporation owned piggyback trailers, which could be loaded on a railroad flat car to provide long haul transportation for shippers or receivers. Once in the hands of the railroads, the foreign corporation would cease to exercise any further control over the movement of a given trailer until it was returned to it at certain points, the nearest one to Maine being in New Jersey. The foreign corporation was paid a daily rental by the railroad that had possession. The court remanded the action to a trial court for entry of a declaratory judgment that the State Tax Assessor of Maine was not authorized to assess a use tax on the foreign corporation's trailers because the trailers, having no established locus in Maine, did not acquire a taxable status within the definition of &quot;use,&quot; as used in Me.

The testatrix died while a patient at the state hospital After the statutory lien redemption period expired with no payments forthcoming from either the testatrix or her estate, the property was sold to the tax sale purchaser. No offer to pay the taxes was made during the time an extension of the period for redemption was granted. Contrary to an assertion raised on appeal, the court found that the Maine tax lien statute was not constitutionally wanting. Moreover, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 3601 did not require town officials to apply for the appointment of a guardian for the incompetent testatrix.

Further, the purpose of the ordinance was to promote traffic safety by reducing accidents on the road or roadside. The court held that the classificatory and regulatory format embodied in the ordinance was pursuant to the police powers of the town, and the ordinance was enacted upon an adequate basis of public necessity, and was enforceable.

All the trusts were devoted to the kinds of charitable uses or organizations described in 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 501(c) and therefore, by virtue of Me. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the sale of Cannabis. On appeal, defendant argued, among 10 points of error, that the charge failed to identify the specific type of Cannabis and that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 2384&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated equal protection of the laws and provided cruel and unusual punishment. In denying the appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 2384 proscribed the sale of all types of Cannabis and that the use of the generic term &quot;marijuana&quot; was sufficiently informative to a person of &quot;common understanding&quot; (the constitutional standard by which the precision of criminal statutes was measured) to clearly describe the substance prohibited. The court held that, even if the dangers attendant upon the use of marijuana were proven to be no greater than those of alcohol, such evidence did not necessarily prevent the State from regulating one and not the other. The court ruled that the sale of hard or narcotic drugs was regulated by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 2361-2380, while Cannabis was treated separately and with significantly milder penalties. The court held that a penalty bearing a rational relation to a valid public policy was given full effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unnecessary acceleration of his motor vehicle so as to cause a harsh, unreasonable and objectionable noise, to wit: squealing tires, in violation of Me.

The motion was denied and the trial judge ordered the matter reported to the court for an interlocutory ruling upon his denial. Although the district attorney agreed that the statute was vague, the court found that it was not invalid. The court held that although the statute did not set exact decibel limitations, its proscriptions were framed in words of common understanding and use. The court also found that the complaint properly charged a criminal offense. The specification of squealing tires described the noise in words of common use which was caused by unnecessary acceleration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction from the York County Superior Court (Maine) for selling dextropropoxyphene, a potent medicinal substance, in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 2210. Defendant's main contention was that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 2201 was unconstitutional because it unlawfully delegated legislative authority to the Board of Commissioners of the Profession of Pharmacy without sufficient standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant theorized that &sect; 2201 was so lacking in standards that the Board was uninhibited in its designation of what are &quot;potent medicinal substances &quot; and, therefore, &sect; 2201 violated state and federal due process rights. If that contention was correct, the indictments were void and the trial court lacked jurisdiction over defendant. For the reason that defendant's argument raised a jurisdictional point it was subject to judicial scrutiny although it was advanced for the first time on appeal. The court found no constitutional infirmity in the statute. A careful reading of &sect; 2201 made it apparent that the enactment, rather than being overly broad, contained limitations, readily understandable by experienced pharmacists, on the type of materials to be designated as &quot;potent medicinal substances.&quot; Such substances, whatever might be their elements or constituencies, had to have a tendency to depress or stimulate and, additionally, be injurious to health if improperly used. The Board, with its statutorily guaranteed expertise, would have no problem in recognizing this general legislative intent. Defendant's other claims of error also lacked merit. The convictions were not disturbed.</SPAN></P>

They argued that that the persistence of defendants, a judgment creditor and his legal counsel, in attaching the truck after a new procedural due process rule in attachment cases was released by the United States Supreme Court violated the debtors' constitutional and statutory rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck had been attached before the rule of Fuentes v. Shevin, broadening procedural protections in state attachment cases, was announced by the United States Supreme Court. On appeal, the court held that the attachment had been effected in compliance with Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 4151 et seq. and Me. Dist. Ct. Civ. R. 4A. The trial court correctly rejected the debtors' contention that the attachment was illegal because it was made on property exempt from attachment under Maine law. The truck was subject to attachment as a chattel constituting an integral unit with a value exceeding the $ 500 maximum value limitation established by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 4401 (1967). The court held that the Fuentes v. Shevin rule, which expanded debtors' procedural due process rights in state pre-judgment attachment cases, was not retroactively applicable to establish an illegality in the attachment itself. The trial court's judgment implicitly held that the instant attachment was not an arbitrary or unfair encroachment on the debtors' rights. Thus, the debtors were precluded from maintaining an independent action based on the Fuentes rule for damages or injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The court opined that the public interest competing against defendant's interest to vindicate a claimed constitutional right was the avoidance of the proliferation of criminality and the potential for anarchy. The court held that the public interest was sufficiently weighty to overbalance defendant's interest to achieve, by a collateral attack, the vindication of a perceived constitutional right that was not protected by the First Amendment.

Upon review of the proposed Act, the court held that it would unconstitutionally deprive a person of life, liberty or property without due process of law in violation of the Constitution of the State of Maine. The court held that act was overbroad because it would improperly permit the confinement of persons who were incapacitated by alcohol in their own homes or other private surroundings in addition to those persons who were incapacitated by alcohol in public, and would also encompass persons only mildly under the influence, who had not presented an immediate, substantial and continuing menace to the public safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for selling the d-lysergic LSD to two individuals. The indictment was made four months after the State knew of the grounds to charge defendant. Defendant claimed a violation of his speedy trial rights and that the selection of the jury from registered voters was unconstitutional. The State's expert witness identified the substance found in defendant's possession as the form of LSD alleged in the indictment. The court held that a five-month delay would not create a presumption of prejudice in the delay in bringing defendant to trial. Because defendant did not claim an inability to recall or reconstruct the events involved, the four-month delay did not create a situation of impermissible delay. Defendant presented no evidence that an identifiable group was systematically excluded from the jury pool by the process of selection from registered voter records, and the method prescribed by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 1255 was therefore not in violation of the fair cross section requirement of Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The expert witness testified to sufficient grounds of his identification of the substance as the form alleged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after items were stolen from a home. The police found items in defendant's possession that fit the description of the stolen articles. Defendant's motion to suppress was granted because the initial search warrant was defective. The indictment was dismissed. At his revocation of probation hearing, defendant moved for suppression of the stolen items. The motion was denied, and defendant's appeal was denied. The revocation hearing was not a stage of a criminal prosecution, and there was no sound reason to require automatic use of the entire body of evidentiary rules that applied in a criminal prosecution. The suppression ruling for the purposes of the prosecution of defendant for the crime of breaking and entering was without carry-over effect to the revocation of probation hearing, and under Me. R. Crim. P. 41(e) the procedure of a motion to suppress was not available for separate and independent use in defendant's revocation hearing. The &quot;evidence-exclusionary&quot; rule lacked applicability to a hearing for revocation of a probation granted incident to the imposition, and suspension of the execution, of a sentence for guilt of crime (or for revocation of parole).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant non-residents appealed from their convictions in the Superior Court in Knox County (Maine), which convicted them of violation of a municipal ordinance for regulation and licensing of shellfishing enacted by a town. The State contended that the ordinance made it illegal for non-residents to engage in illegal digging to include the digging of clams as well as shellfishing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-residents were charged with the illegal digging of clams in violation of a town ordinance barring non-residents from digging or shellfishing. The non-residents were found guilty of the ordinance violation and appealed, contending that the town could not effectively enact an ordinance which would discriminate against residents of other communities of the state. The State asserted that the ordinance was enacted under the authority granted to municipalities by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect;&sect; 4251 and 4252. This law permitted municipalities to enter into shellfish conservation programs, alone or with other municipalities and to appropriate money for these purposes. The court noted that the State had a valid interest in the conservation of its clams together with the desirability of limiting the number of diggers on proper occasions in order to further that purpose and meet a compelling state interest. However, since there was no reasonable relationship to conservation justified in the enactment of the ordinance excluding nonresidents from digging, that the part of the ordinance was invalid. The appeal by the non-residents was sustained.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that defendant's compliance did not result in her giving self-incriminating testimony.

Pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 845, the taxpayer appealed the assessors' refusal to abate taxes imposed on a shopping center.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The shopping center was assessed at the fair market value based on a &quot;reproduction cost less depreciation&quot; approach, a method employed uniformly as to all real property in the town. On appeal, the court concluded that denial of the taxpayer's appeal from the assessors' refusal to abate the taxes was proper. Applying a de novo standard of review, the court concluded that the referee properly presumed the assessors' valuation was valid and allowed the taxpayer to challenge the valuation with expert testimony on the fair market value of the property based on a &quot;capitalization of income&quot; approach. The referee correctly disregarded the alternative valuation because the evidence was neither credible nor persuasive enough to justify the conclusion that the taxpayer's property had been substantially overvalued. Adoption of the income approach would have required the assessors to value the property differently based on its present ability to generate income. The assessors could not lawfully treat the taxpayer differently because his property was not producing the rate of return on his investment that was anticipated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Ann. tit. 23, &sect;&sect; 153, 154 and 651, the Maine State Highway Commission sought to acquire easement rights in and to certain lands as part of a comprehensive plan to preserve and develop the natural scenic beauty along and adjacent to a state highway. The landowners sought injunctive relief against the taking on the ground that the enabling legislation was unconstitutional on its face or, if constitutional, did not sanction the condemnation of any part of the land, nor did it permit a taking of such magnitude. On appeal, the court held that the taking of land beyond the right of way of a state highway for such a purpose was a valid public use justifying the State's exercise of the power of eminent domain thus, the Act Relating to Roadside Beautification of 1965 (Act) was constitutional on its face. However, the court held that the commissioner abused his power under the Act in taking from the landowners an excess of 1000 feet from the edge of the highway right of way, in the absence of any compelling reasons to take the marginal excess to preserve the primary beauty scene.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court noted that it was the practice in the State, where good cause was shown, to place a complaint or indictment on file after conviction, or to continue the case to a later time for sentence. The court went through the history of the issue and determined that the district court was not authorized to finally terminate the prosecution of a case before or after a plea. There was no legislative intent shown to confer upon a judge the power to permanently dispose of a case on his own motion. The court concluded that Me. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the incident that lead to the conviction, defendant's wife had gone to another's home to call police. Defendant rushed in, grabbed the telephone from his wife, and struck a person who was attempting to free her from his grasp. On appeal, the court held that the statute was constitutional and that the indictment was sufficient. Precedent construing the statute clearly indicated the type of circumstances that were considered to be of a high and aggravated nature. The judicial construction of the statute allowed the statute to meet the test of constitutional definiteness because an ordinary person of common intelligence was fairly informed what conduct would render him liable for the more severe penalties associated with aggravated assault and battery. The indictment's allegation that defendant made an assault of a high and aggravated nature was sufficient because aggravation was not an essential element of the crime. Aggravation could be charged in general terms without setting out the circumstances that raised the crime from the misdemeanor category to the felony class. If further information was necessary to the preparation of defense, defendant could seek a bill of particulars.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's duties as a truck driver included operating a snowplow to remove snow from the streets. Defendant was unhappy with the way that the snow was plowed in front of his house and talked with the victim about not piling the snow in defendant's driveway. Thereafter, defendant shot towards the victim's truck after snow was plowed into his driveway, knocking over a child. Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 201-A. The court found that the indictment, which alleged that the firearm involved was a shotgun, sufficiently alleged that defendant was armed because a person who committed an assault while he had a gun in his possession for use as a weapon, even if the gun was not used in the commission of the assault, was committing the assault while armed with a firearm within the intendment of &sect; 201-A. Finally, defendant's gun was not improperly seized, as defendant was not under police custody when he gave the shotgun to the sheriff and defendant's own subjective evaluation of the situation was that, even when he was on the way to the police station, he was not under actual police control and was only going for further discussions of his problems with the victim and the snowplow.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of an action against the corporation for alleged flood damage to their properties, the creditors attached certain of the corporation's land.

Subsequently, an amendment to Rule 4A was promulgated which included the attachment of real estate within the prior notice and hearing requirement. The corporation then filed a motion to dismiss the creditors' attachment, which was granted by the superior court. Upon review, the court found not reason to doubt the constitutional validity of Rule 4A and Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4451 in force at the time of the attachment. Furthermore, the court determined that a retroactive application of the amendment would be inappropriate and instead the amendment should have a prospective invalidation of the original Rule 4A.

Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5951 et seq. to establish the constitutionality of a 1972 poll tax levied on the taxpayer and the relative rights of the parties. The State of Maine was permitted to intervene as a party-defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 1381, the tax assessor assessed a poll tax upon the taxpayer, which he paid under protest in order to obtain a driver's license. He then applied for an abatement of the three-dollar poll tax on the grounds that such an assessment was arbitrary and discriminatory and violated his right to equal protection under the 14th Amendment. Defendant tax assessor denied the request for an abatement. The court held that the taxpayer's attack on the constitutionality of the poll tax statute was an improper basis for a claim of abatement, and such action was ineffective to obtain a ruling on the constitutionality of the tax statute which had been repealed. Additionally, the court held that to prevent mooting of the question, due to the interim repeal of the poll tax statute, the taxpayer had to prove a right to recover the money paid. However, as the tax was not paid under legally cognizable duress, the taxpayer had no entitlement to its refund. The failure to establish a claim of right for the recovery of the collected tax left his action a mere request for a declaratory judgment on the past validity of the poll tax statute, and was therefore moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The report was discharged, and the taxpayer's complaint requesting an abatement and seeking declaratory judgment that the tax statute was unconstitutional was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer had posted a notice to employees that it was going out of business, and it did so only 13 days later.

While this action was pending, the legislature repealed &sect; 625(2) and substituted a new paragraph in its place. The court ruled that the action was not moot due to a savings clause in Me. Rev.

Also, the court concluded that the action was not moot even though the former employers did not counterclaim for severance payments. Further, the court rejected the employer's claim that the statute violated the due process and equal protection provisions of the Maine and federal constitutions. The court held that the statute was not void for vagueness and there was no lack of due process. The court concluded that, both Me. Rev. Stat.

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34, &sect;&sect; 710, 807, or 859, depending on the institution involved. The court distinguished furloughed inmates from parolees because a furlough terminated with the expiration of time, while parole terminated with complete discharge, barring some affirmative act of parole violation and revocation. The court found that the indictments charged that each defendant had failed to return on expiration of his furlough and alleged the offense of escape under Me. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case against defendant originated in the district court on a complaint which charged defendant with speeding, in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 1251. Defendant, purportedly acting under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 2114, declined in open court to waive in writing his right to a jury trial and elected to proceed to trial before a district court judge on a plea of not guilty. The district court thereupon transferred the case to the superior court for arraignment and disposition. Subsequently, the superior court reported the case to the court, pursuant to Me. R. Crim. P. 37A(b), for a determination as to whether Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, guaranteed a right of a jury trial to defendant. At the outset of its decision, the court held that the constitutional issue was properly before it. Furthermore, the court held that, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2114, defendant was legally deemed to have demanded a jury trial unless and until by affirmative action, in writing, defendant waived it. The court concluded that Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, guaranteed defendant a right of a jury trial in connection with the charge of speeding.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 3701 by stating that he intended to shoot a certain man. The statement was not made to the man at whom the threat was aimed. Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that its factual allegations were insufficient to charge an offense. The court noted that its previous decisions regarding &sect; 3701 reflected a concern that its application could impinge on the freedom of speech guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The court held that although &sect; 3701 could be held to encompass threats made or published to persons other than those against whom the threats were directed, in order to prevent &sect; 3701 from unconstitutional vagueness or overbreadth it was required that further circumstances be shown that indicated the existence of a reasonable likelihood that some person would be caused alarm or fear.

The Maine Income Tax Law, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 5101 et seq., became effect a few months after the taxpayers sold their home. The tax assessor included the taxpayers' instatement payments as part of their taxable income. The court affirmed the tax assessor's application of the income tax law. The court stated that since the installment payments were taxed as federal income in 1970 and 1971, they were automatically subject to Maine taxation. By adoption of federal adjusted gross income as the standard for &quot;entire taxable income&quot; of a Maine individual, the legislature intended to resolve, a priori, semantic conflicts such as those suggested by the bare words of the statute. Maine's legislature foreclosed the necessity for determination of the &quot;source, nature or composition of the funds.&quot; The court also held that the tax was not retroactive because it reached the profits actually received after the law's effective date, rather than the sale of assets that preceded enactment. Accordingly, the court entered a judgment in favor of the tax assessor.</SPAN></P>

A building inspector denied her building permit application, which denial was affirmed by the Board. The Board also denied her related variance application. When the superior court upheld the Board's action, she appealed. The court affirmed the decisions below. The court first found that the zoning ordinance imposing a minimum lot size of 30,000 square feet was constitutionally sound; it was properly adopted and it served numerous legitimate interests such as controlling congestion and minimizing fire dangers. It also rejected a claim that the Board's denial of her variance application was improper. It ruled that the existence of other non-conforming uses in the same zone did not justify the establishment of an additional non-confirming use, that appropriate standards were applied by the Board in denying the variance, that the owner's &quot;plight&quot; was not &quot;due to unique circumstances,&quot; and that &quot;undue hardship&quot; had not been shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 897, duty upon striking unattended vehicle, released upon bail, and afforded two weeks time to raise a fine, which was imposed as a sentence. After the inmate failed to present himself for formal sentencing according to an agreed statement of facts, he reported his failure to accumulate the sum for the fine. Due to the failure to pay the fine he was committed to the county jail pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1904. The inmate then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. On review, the major issue was whether or not an individual could be imprisoned for non-payment of a fine solely because of his indigency. The court concluded that because the agreed statement of facts was so meager it had to discharge the report. In remanding the action, the court remarked that when a court has made the determination that the penal objectives of the State will be met by payment of a fine alone, it could well be that it is constitutionally insignificant whether a defendant might have been imprisoned for his crime at the outset, if the court had determined that the penal objectives of the State required imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation requested approval of a proposed development of a petroleum refinery on an island. The application for approval was denied by appellee, the Environmental Improvement Commission (Maine). The appeal was taken pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 38 &sect; 487 seeking judicial review of the Commission's action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation notified the Commission of its intent to build an oil refinery and of the nature and location of the proposed development. The Commission determined that a public hearing was necessary. Following the hearing, the commission made 44 findings of fact from which 10 conclusions were drawn. A proposed development had to satisfy a list of criteria under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit 38, &sect; 484 that included financial capacity, traffic movement, no adverse affect on natural environment, and soil types. Applicants had to affirmatively demonstrate compliance with each criterion and failure to do so as to any one of them constituted a basis for denial. On the basis of the 10 findings, the Commission determined that the corporation had failed to sustain its burden of proof that the proposed development met the criteria. On review, the court held that the standards that the Environmental Improvement Act imposed were clear, explicit, rationally related to the purposes of the Act and were adequate guides for the conduct of both the Commission and the applicants. The record in the action contained competent and substantial evidence that supported the result reached by the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant witness sought review of the decision of a trial court (Maine) that held him in contempt of court and sentenced him to a county jail after he disregarded the trial court's order to answer certain questions posed to him, notwithstanding his asserted understanding of the grant and scope of the immunity granted to him by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1314-A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The witness was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony at the first trial of two individuals, regarding an alleged conspiracy that involved the witness and both individuals. The witness argued that &sect; 1314-A was unconstitutional because the immunity that it granted was so limited that it violated his right against self-incrimination as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. V and Me. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. He also argued that a second conviction for contempt, arising when he refused to testify at the second trial of the individuals, violated the double jeopardy provisions of the United States and Maine Constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. V and Me. Const. art. 18 &sect; 8. The court denied the witness's appeal, concluding that the immunity granted by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1314-A actually afforded considerably broader protection than the privilege contained in U.S. Const. amend. V because it granted transactional immunity rather than merely immunity from use and derivative use. The court found no double jeopardy issue, concluding that each refusal of defendant to testify was punishable as a separate and distinct act of contempt.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, and sustained the owner's appeal. The court held that the ordinance was enacted as part of the city's police power, and not as a zoning ordinance. Accordingly, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily delegated to the city planning board an arbitrary power of approval of the location of house trailers within the city limits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct. The superior court refused his motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the statute under which defendant was convicted, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 3953, was constitutionally defective. Defendant challenged the decision, contending that it was erroneous. The court noted as an initial matter that it declined constitutional review of a statute absent necessity or extraordinary circumstance. Here the matter was deemed subject to reversal on the complaint itself, alleviating the necessity of constitutional review. The complaint must have been sufficient to inform either defendant or the court as to what acts involving defendant's conduct or language occurred and amounted to the ultimate fact, here disorderly conduct. The complaint must have been worded with sufficient specificity to enable the court to make a determination as to whether the speech was patently offensive or was subject to some constitutional protection. Here the complaint wholly failed to provide any information that would have met the specificity requirements. Accordingly, the appeal was sustained, and the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 3701.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant asserted that the statute under which he was convicted, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 3701, was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court held that, in the light of the meaning given by Maine courts to the word &quot;threat&quot; and the construction given by the courts to &sect; 3701, the argument that the statute was vague or overbroad failed. Defendant, while temporarily in a detention cell at a police station under arrest for intoxication, had stated that when he got out of jail, he was going to go home, get his gun, and kill some police officers. The court held that the jury could have properly inferred that this threat was directed at the police officers in attendance in the adjoining room and particularly at the arresting officer, that the statement was not made in jest but in deadly earnest, and that it contained a promise of evil to be taken seriously by the ordinary hearer. The court affirmed the conviction because it found that the jury could and did find a true threat, not constituting constitutionally protected speech but properly prohibited by statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that there was no prejudice by the grant of defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with being an accessory after the fact. It was not error to appoint as counsel for the prosecution's witness the same attorney who was representing defendant in another court on a separate and distinct criminal charge. The sentence imposed by the trial court did not constitute cruel, unusual, or unreasonable punishment, because it was within the statutory limits. The trial court erred in requiring the jury to respond to interrogatories in the event of a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict, but the error was not of constitutional dimension, because the court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. Defendant's guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and no rational jury could have concluded otherwise. The interrogatories submitted to the jury were not coercive. Evidence of defendant's active participation in the commission of a felony did not preclude his conviction as an accessory before the fact thereto.</SPAN></P>
