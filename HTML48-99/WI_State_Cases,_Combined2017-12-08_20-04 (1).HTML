<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission certified a class of taxpayers, ordered refunds by the Department to the class of taxes collected on federal pensions, and the trial court dismissed the Department's petition for review as untimely without exploring the merits of the class certification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review from an order of the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which denied defendant's motion to dismiss the criminal complaint because he was prosecuted under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 948,02(2), sex with a person under 16 years old, relating to an incident involving a 13-year-old girl. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 948.02(2) was unconstitutional because it violated his privacy right to engage in consensual sexual relations. He also argued that the statute as applied had a chilling effect on the exercise of his right to select sexual partners. The court rejected all of defendant's arguments. According to the court, while adults have a right to privacy with regard to sexual relations and decisions involving procreation, that right is not absolute and may be circumscribed or regulated where important state interests are at stake. Defendant had no privacy right to engage in sexual intercourse with a person whom the legislature has determined is unable to give consent. The court also found that the State's interest in protecting children and prohibiting sexual activity between them and adults was of greater import than the burden upon an adult to determine whether a prospective sexual partner was unable to consent to sexual activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's order denying defendant's motion to dismiss a criminal complaint charging him with second-degree sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant's five-year-old son did not obey his instruction to stop throwing chestnuts at cars, defendant struck his son on the buttocks three to five times with an army cloth webbed belt. The blows missed and struck the son on his right thigh where extensive bruising appeared. At the close of the evidence at trial, the jury convicted defendant of physical abuse of a child. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's contention that his conduct was reasonable discipline. The court noted that the State presented the testimony of an examining physician, who established that defendant struck his son at least four times and that it took significant force to cause the son's injuries. According to the court, the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendant had used excessive force. Further, the court held that the introduction of testimony regarding conversations that defendant had with the investigating officer and a social worker was proper because it was offered to impeach defendant's claim that he intended to administer a light spanking.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.225(2)(d) and 940.225(3), for sexual intercourse with an unconscious person and without the consent of that person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was drunk, stoned, and intermittently asleep when defendant first performed oral sex on her then had vaginal intercourse. He was convicted of three offenses, one relating to the oral sex, and two relating to the single act of intercourse. In reversing the third degree sexual assault conviction, the court first observed that this conviction passed the Blockburger-Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.66(1) test, in that the third degree offense was not a lesser-included offense of the second degree offense. The court held however that the legislature did not authorize punishment for both offenses stemming from the same act, noting that the thrust of both offenses was to protect the victim from nonconsensual intercourse, and that there was no legislative indication to punish a defendant twice for this same act. The court held that the appropriate remedy was to reverse the conviction for the lesser offense. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of the oral sex offense, Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(a), noting that the pummeling the victim received before she passed out was force contemplated by the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's third degree sexual assault conviction and affirmed his two second-degree sexual assault convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile, sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Lincoln County (Wisconsin), convicting him of assault and battery of a prison guard pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.183, which automatically placed a juvenile in criminal court for committing an assault or battery in a juvenile detention facility, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 970.032, which provided for a &quot;reverse waiver&quot; hearing to determine jurisdiction over a juvenile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was charged with attacking an employee of the secured juvenile correctional facility where he was confined, contended that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48.183 and 970.032 violated his due process and equal protection rights by revealing his identity to the public and press. On review, the court held that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48.183 and 970.032 did not deprive defendant of his right to life, liberty, or property as protected by U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court concluded that no governmental decision based on substantive predicates needed to be made before the trial court assumed jurisdiction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.183, which automatically granted the trial court jurisdiction in certain circumstances. The only decision the trial court was to make was whether to retain jurisdiction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 970.032. Even if the trial court decided not to retain jurisdiction, defendant's name would still have been released to the public by virtue of the trial court's original jurisdiction. Because the court did not make a decision to assume jurisdiction based on substantive predicates, the statutes did not create a constitutionally protected right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police arrested defendant while he was loading marijuana growing equipment on his truck and just after he had taken physical possession of some marijuana from his accomplice. The State charged the two with producing marijuana at the accomplice's residence. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. The court held that at a minimum the evidence showed the existence of a common enterprise in which defendant and his accomplice shared the enterprise's proceeds and over which defendant exerted substantial control. In the alternative, the evidence permitted a finding that defendant had exclusive control over the operation and that the accomplice was an employee. If the jury reached either conclusion, then it could find that defendant legally possessed at least a share of the marijuana that the enterprise produced even if defendant's physical possession just before his arrest was insufficient by itself to prove legal possession. Defendant had not shown reasonable grounds for conviction on the simple possession lesser charge. Additionally, defendant had not shown that the State lacked either the power or a rational basis to tax 42.5 grams as occupational possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff personal property owner sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Outagamie County (Wisconsin), which dismissed his complaint with prejudice. The owner sought a declaratory judgment that City of Appleton, Wis., Municipal Code &sect; 12-32(c), governing non-summary abatement, was unconstitutional and that defendant city violated the owner's due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner had a business in which he stored large household appliances outdoors. The city inspected the business and found several ordinance violations, including the storage of the appliances. The city directed the owner to take corrective action, but the owner failed to do so. After giving notice to the owner, the city, pursuant to &sect; 12-32, entered the premises and removed the appliances to a warehouse. The city notified the owner that unless he reclaimed his property it would be disposed of. When the owner failed to contact the city, the property was sold to offset the costs of abatement and storage. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the owner's complaint. The court concluded that &sect; 12-32 denied the owner neither substantive nor procedural due process. Section 12-32(c) was designed to provide the city with a procedure for eliminating public nuisances through the seizure and removal of nuisances. The procedure had a reasonable and rational relationship to the purpose or object of the enactment. The ordinance also provided the owner with the opportunity to contest the abatement procedure in a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.</SPAN></P>

The court held that petitioner failed to carry his burden that the statutes were unconstitutional. First, the court reasoned the 72-hour provision under &sect; 51.20(7)(a) was not ambiguous. Second, the court reasoned petitioner was considered a late detainee as he was detained later in the week, therefore the weekend and holidays were excluded within the time frame that he was entitled to a probable cause hearing. Last, the court reasoned petitioner was not denied his right to equal protection or due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The obstetrician for petitioner expectant mother found she was using drugs during pregnancy. When she refused help, he reported her to respondent county. The county, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.19(1)(c), took the mother's viable fetus into protective custody, necessitating the internment of the mother. She petitioned for habeas or supervisory relief to the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin) and appealed the denial of her petitions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the mother's viable fetus was a &quot;person&quot; under the statutory definition of &quot;child&quot; in Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.02(2). Therefore, the county had the jurisdiction to exercise its authority over the fetus as an endangered child. The court further held that all components of the juvenile court's exclusive original jurisdiction had been satisfied in this case, so that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the custody order and personal jurisdiction over the fetus as the endangered child. Although the mother contended that the juvenile court lacked personal jurisdiction over her, the court noted that the statute did not require original jurisdiction over the parent. The juvenile court was authorized to adjudicate the matter of protective custody and to issue a protective order for the custody of the viable fetus pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.19(1)(c). Finally, the court held that the pending custody statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.13, and protective custody provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.19(1), represented a proper and tailored means by which the state might exercise its compelling interest in promoting the health, safety, and welfare of the mother's viable fetus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the mother's petitions for a writ of habeas corpus or, in the alternative, for a supervisory writ, in the matter involving the county's order obtaining protective custody over the mother's viable fetus.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the &quot;affix and display&quot; and the &quot;payment&quot; provisions of the drug tax stamp law violated his right against compelled self-incrimination guaranteed by the Wisconsin and United States Constitutions. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the drug tax stamp statute both contemplated and permitted the anonymous payment of the tax and, therefore, did not subject those who complied with its provisions of compelled self-incrimination. The court relied upon Wis. Stat. &sect; 139.91, which provided that dealers may not have been required to provide any identifying information in connection with the purchase of stamps.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that the evidence was insufficient because his refusal to give the arresting officer his driver's license and his date of birth did not &quot;obstruct&quot; the officer. The court held that a person obstructed an officer in the course of his official duties if he prevented or made more difficult the performance of the officer's duties. The officer made a valid arrest for a speeding violation recorded by radar and for operation of a vehicle without displaying state registration plates. In order for the officer to properly identify defendant, who was driving the vehicle, it was necessary to know more than his name. The officer made a prima facie showing of a statutory violation when he testified that defendant would neither produce a valid driver's license nor provide his date of birth. The officer testified that he needed the date of birth to verify defendant's driving status on the teletype. Thus, the jury was entitled to infer from the evidence that defendant's conduct &quot;obstructed&quot; the officer in the course of pursuing a valid stop for traffic violations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a high school teacher who had consensual sexual intercourse with a student. Although he was pursuing a master's degree in psychology, he was not a therapist. The student sought him out to talk to because she was depressed and having trouble getting along with her parents. They met about once a week during lunch hour to discuss her problems. Defendant gave her advice and on a couple of occasions, he gave her homework, such as writing down the arguments she had with her family. He would go over the assignment, and they would discuss how she could have done things differently. Upon review, the court found that &sect; 940.22 required proof of a professional therapist-patient/client relationship to sustain a conviction. The court concluded that defendant was not a professional therapist and was counseling the student within a teacher-student relationship. His meetings with the student were ad hoc, loosely structured, and stopped altogether during school vacations or when other duties intervened. He did not take a patient history, make a diagnosis, take notes of the meetings, develop a treatment plan, or charge a fee. Defendant did not hold himself out as a therapist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's complaint alleged respondent breached its agreement with petitioner contrary to Wisconsin criminal and civil statutes. Respondent counterclaimed. After trial, both parties appealed various aspects of trial, verdict, and awards. Court ruled breach of contract verdict against respondent was correctly set aside, since contract was too indefinite to be enforced as petitioner claimed. Court found petitioner established its damages for conversion with sufficient definiteness and that thus award had been incorrectly reduced. Court agreed credible evidence did not establish respondent enjoyed, and therefore must disgorge, unjust enrichment. Court concluded reasonable punitive damages amounted to approximately 10 times amount of compensatory damages award. Lower court was correct in dismissing Wisconsin Organized Crime Control Act, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 946.80-946.88, claims, since petitioner had been unable to establish Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1961 et seq., violations in another suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a petition to terminate an unmarried mother and father's parental rights. The mother did not contest. As to the father, the State claimed that he failed to assume parental responsibility pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6). The matter went to hearing on a paternity issue and the termination petition. The trial court adjudicated the father as the child's father and then terminated his rights. In affirming the judgment, the court found that the consolidation of the paternity issue and the termination petition did not offend the provisions of &sect; 48.415 or Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.423 nor abridge the father's rights. There was evidence that the father maintained a relationship with the child during his first few months of life, but he had little contact after that. The father claimed that once the substantial parental relationship existed, it did not matter that the relationship later disappeared. This claim was waived because this construction of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6)(a)(2) was not asserted in the trial court. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the father's construction of the statute because the construction had never been raised or adopted by the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was initially charged with having sexual intercourse with his four-year-old daughter in violation of &sect; 940.225(1)(d). At trial, the daughter testified that the inmate touched her vaginal area with his fingers; the testimony of two pediatricians was consistent with that claim. The trial court permitted the State to amend the information during the trial to charge the inmate with assault based on sexual contact rather than intercourse. On appeal, the court affirmed the inmate's conviction. Sexual contact was not a lesser-included offense of sexual intercourse and the inclusion of both forms of assault in the same statute,&nbsp;&sect; 940.225(1)(d), did not violate due process or equal protection; the legislature reasonably could conclude that sexual activity by an adult with a child, regardless of whether the conduct involved sexual contact or sexual intercourse, was a social evil that should be forbidden. The inmate failed to object to the amendment of the information and thus waived his right to challenge it on appeal; moreover, the amendment did not prejudice the inmate where it did not change the factual basis for the charge or have any impact on his theory of defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because he had not been served with process.

Defendant also claimed that the trial court had jurisdiction over his counterclaim and cross-claims under Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.01(2). The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the claims because they were not authorized under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.119(3)(b). Further, the cross-claim allegations against the sitting judge were a transparent attempt to obtain a substitution after the time had expired under Wis. Stat. &sect; 801.58(1).

Further, the ex parte proceedings held by the trial court did not violate Wis. Sup. Ct. R. 60.20(2)(a).

Stat. &sect; 347.245.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State charged appellants with violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 347.245 when they refused to display red-orange, triangular &quot;slow-moving vehicle&quot; emblems on their horse-drawn buggies. Appellants claimed that emblems violated their religious beliefs, but the trial court found for the State and ordered appellants to pay a forfeiture. Appellants sought review and the court reversed. The court held that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2000bb to 2000bb-4, governed the case. The RFRA restored the compelling state interest test for controversies over laws that substantially burdened the First Amendment right to free exercise of religion. As applied to appellants, the court held that the slow-moving vehicle (SMV) statute failed RFRA's compelling state interest test. Although the court found that the State had a compelling interest in traffic safety, it said that the State failed to show that the SMV statute represented the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. The court noted that appellants were willing to place white reflective tape and lanterns on their buggies and that the State had not proven that those measures were any less safe than the emblem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, mother and son, appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed their action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging that defendants, county and social worker, violated their procedural and substantive due process rights when the social worker changed a delinquent stepson's placement, in violation of Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48.357(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's stepson was adjudged delinquent and placed out of the home and under the supervision of the county. The social worker later placed the stepson back in the home, where he shot the mother and her son. The trial court dismissed their actions under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for violation of their procedural and substantive due process rights by placement of the stepson back in the home without first providing them with notice and an opportunity to file an objection with the court, as required by Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48.357(1). A jury found in the social worker's favor on their negligence claim, due to lack of causation. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that postdeprivation state law remedies under state tort law were adequate, and their availability defeated the procedural due process claim. For substantive due process purposes, no special relationship existed between the stepson and the state, thereby relieving the state of any duty to protect him. The state had no duty to protect the mother and the stepson from the stepson's violent behavior. The trial court correctly instructed the jury on the issue of causation, and the jury verdict was supported by credible evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment dismissing the mother and son's action for deprivation of constitutional rights in violation of the federal civil rights statute was affirmed. Adequate postdeprivation state law remedies existed to afford them procedural due process, and the state had no duty under substantive due process to protect them from violence when the stepson was not in custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff teacher's association and defendant Employee Trust Funds Board (board) challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which held that the Special Investment Performance Dividend Legislation (SIPD), 1987 Wis. Act 27, &sect;&sect; 436m, 684r, 688km, amending the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS), Wis. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 40, violated constitutional prohibitions against the taking of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The WRS provided retirement benefits for public employees. Under the SIPD, earnings on the WRS trust fund assets of certain annuitants were used to pay supplemental benefits that were not a commitment of the WRS trust fund. The purpose of the SIPD was to reduce the general purpose revenue funding of supplemental benefits The court affirmed the judgment in part and held that the SIPD unconstitutionally took the property of the teachers who were WRS annuitants for a public purpose without just compensation. The court further held that that the teacher's association did not have to comply with the notice of claim statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.82(3), because it did not apply to a claim of unconstitutional taking. However, the court reversed the amount awarded the teacher's association and held that because the unconstitutional taking was continuing, the teacher's association was entitled to declaratory relief and an injunction against the SIPD, in addition to just compensation. Additionally, the court held that the teacher's association was entitled to attorneys' fees under the common fund doctrine because it was appropriate to pay attorney fees out of the sum recovered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The goods transporter had an agency agreement with the van line whereby it hauled goods for the van line's customers. The van line obtained worker's compensation coverage for the goods transporter's drivers. The State informed the goods transporter that it was illegally uninsured and that the certificates of insurance naming the van line as the named insured and the goods transporter as certificate holders were insufficient to show compliance with the Worker's Compensation Act (Act). The State commenced an enforcement action against the goods transporter. The goods transporter filed a third-party claim against the van line. The trial court granted summary judgment for the State. The goods transporter and the van line appealed. The court held that the goods transporter's contractual arrangement with the van line to provide it with worker's compensation insurance was void because it was inconsistent with &sect; 102.28(2)(a) and the intent of the Act generally, in that it failed to provide coverage for all of its potential employees and all potential work-related activities of its employees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department ruled that the final environmental impact statement (EIS) complied with WEPA. The court concluded that the state legislation appropriating state funds for construction of the parking ramp was not enacted through a private or local bill within the meaning of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 18 as the state had a proprietary interest in providing parking for employees working in its buildings, wherever they were located. Having failed to overcome the presumption of regularity attaching to the presiding officer's actions at the EIS hearings, the court rejected the preservationists' claim that the hearing officer was biased. The site-specific language of the legislation authorizing the parking ramp's funding rendered consideration or implementation of any alternative remote and speculative and not at all reasonably related to the purposes of the environmental review of the project under Wis. Stat. &sect; 1.11(2)(e) of WEPA. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the preservationists' new evidence motion as the trial court exercised its discretion under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The guardian challenged the standard of review used by the trial court for deciding custody. The court found that when a guardianship was terminated, a parent was entitled to custody of a child unless the trial court finds that the parent is unfit or compelling reasons exist for awarding custody to a third party. The second issue was whether sufficient evidence supported the trial court's finding that there were no compelling circumstances making it appropriate to award custody to a third party, the guardian. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that no compelling reasons existed for awarding custody of the child to the guardian. The court found that the facts of record from which the trial court concluded that there were no compelling circumstances to deny the mother custody of child differed from the facts the guardian stressed in his brief. After hearing the evidence, the court might have concluded that the mother was the parent the guardian asserted her to be, but it did not, and the court could not second guess the trial court decision under its standard of review.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 125.12(2)(ag)2, finding that he maintained a disorderly or riotous indecent or improper house, based on public displays of sexual acts and prostitution on the premises. The bar owner sought review of the judgment upholding the revocation of his liquor license, arguing that &sect; 125.12(2)(ag)2 was unconstitutionally overbroad and that the facts of the case did not justify revocation. On appeal, the court found that the bar owner lacked standing to challenge the statute on the basis of its overbreadth because the acts in questions, public sex and prostitution, were not protected by the First Amendment. Next, the court rejected the argument that the conduct that occurred on the premises was insufficient to justify revocation. Police officers testified to witnessing nude entertainers performing fellatio on patrons in exchange for money and numerous acts of cunnilingus and several masturbatory acts occurring between entertainers and patrons.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found the nightclub owner guilty of violating Fond Du Lac County, Wis., Cabaret Ordinance &sect; 1, which required certain liquor license holders to obtain a cabaret permit before providing any form of dance entertainment. The nightclub owner appealed, contending that the county's regulatory scheme was vague and overbroad and that it violated equal protection principles because the same type of entertainment was permitted in a city within the county. On appeal, the court held that Cabaret Ordinance &sect; 1 was facially unconstitutional under the overbreadth doctrine because it encompassed nude expression which was not associated with harmful secondary effects. A plain reading of the ordinance revealed that many forms of unclothed entertainment that did not effectuate secondary concerns would have been subject to the ordinance. A modern dance of which nude dance was a part would have been prohibited by the ordinance if offered in a venue that had liquor on the premises. Yet the county could not have pointed to any harmful secondary effects emanating from such a performance, such as prostitution or criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

Zoning Ordinance, Art III &sect; 9(1), by their having placed mobile homes and outbuildings on their property. The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of appellees. Appellants challenged that order. On review, the court determined that the plain language of the ordinance prohibited the placement of mobile homes and outbuildings on the property. Appellees argued that they used the mobile homes for camping and that the neighborhood associated had accepted the presence of the same by charging additional monies for homeowners that had mobile homes on their lots for camping purposes. The court found that failure to enforce zoning ordinances in the past did not render those ordinances invalid for enforcement purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother sought review of an order from the Circuit Court, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, that terminated her parental rights to her children pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.43. The mother filed a notice of no merit appeal pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.32. The issues on appeal were whether &sect; 809.32 applied to an appeal of a termination order and whether the notice of appeal deadline in Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.107(5) could be extended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the no merit procedure in Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.32, which established a 180-day time limit for filing a notice of appeal, did not apply to appeals from orders terminating parental rights. Appeals from termination orders were governed by Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.107 exclusively. The court was not authorized under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.82(2)(a) to enlarge the 15-day time limit for filing the notice of appeal under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.107(5). The mother argued that the 15-day time limit violated the separation of powers doctrine and denied her due process and equal protection rights. The mother did not show that the 15-day time limit imposed by the legislature unconstitutionally intruded upon or burdened the judiciary in an area of shared power. The shortened appeal time did not violate due process. There were minimal content requirements for a notice of appeal, and an extension of time to file a brief could be requested. The equal protection challenge failed because there was a rational basis for having a short time limit. Children and parents had a significant interest in proceedings that affected the familial relationship. There was no basis for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The partnership, a law firm, asserted that the surcharge tax against it was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause. The court disagreed and affirmed the tax assessment. In affirming, the court held that constitutional challenges to a statute must overcome a strong presumption of constitutionality. A party attacking a statute on constitutional grounds had the burden of proving that the statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. In the area of taxation, the legislature had wide discretion in making classifications. These types of classifications need only be reasonably related to the purposes of the legislation. The court noted that the exemption provided to farmers did not violate the constitution because farmers, unlike other businesses, could not necessarily absorb the recycling surcharge tax through increasing the prices of their product because of the vagaries of the commodity marketplace. Additionally, the court noted that the classification served a legitimate state interest by giving a partial exemption to a valuable part of Wisconsin's economy, which had seen a decrease in numbers.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that no ex post facto violation existed and reversed. The court found that considered as a whole the rules established presumptive security classifications for life-term inmates according to risks presented in four categories, and they permitted recognition of individual or exceptional cases through a discretionary early-reassignment process. They were drafted to achieve legitimate governmental and correctional ends, and nothing in the record suggested an aim to punish for past activity or to accomplish a more burdensome punishment. The Department's concern was not the imposition of additional penal sanctions on life-term inmates but was directed toward assessment and amelioration of the risks presented by inmates in all categories in a prison setting.

The court held that application of &sect; 48.415(8) to the father did not violate the prohibition on ex post facto laws because the legislative intent was not to punish murders but to provide support for children. For the same reason, application of the statute did not violate the double jeopardy clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Sheboygan County (Wisconsin), which suspended defendant's driver's license for six months, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.50, after defendant pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.41(3r). On appeal, defendant asserted that the suspension of his license violated his due process rights because a vehicle was not used in the commission of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police executed a search warrant at defendant's residence and discovered less than one ounce of marijuana in various units. He was charged with three counts of possession of marijuana in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.41(3r), but no allegations were made regarding the use of a motor vehicle in the commission of the offense. After defendant pleaded no contest and was convicted on each count, his license was suspended pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.50. While defendant conceded that having a driver's license was not a fundamental right, he argued that the suspension was not rationally related to the furtherance of a proper public purpose because the revocation sanction for drug offenders had no reasonable relationship to public health, safety, and welfare where the use or operation of a motor vehicle was not directly related to the commission of the offense. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 161.50 had a rational relationship to the state's strong interest in punishing drug offenders, deterring future possession and use of controlled substances, and protecting citizens on state roads from those who might have been driving while impaired.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 51.20(1)(am), 51.20(13)(g)3 was facially unconstitutional because it did not require a person to be found dangerous.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the recommitment standard required a finding of dangerousness and that the mentally ill individual's constitutional challenge failed. The mentally ill individual also contended that the trial court's jury instructions and special verdict constituted an unconstitutional application of the recommitment statute because the jury was not required to make a finding of dangerousness. The court found that the challenge to the instructions and the verdict were not properly preserved for appeal. Even if the court were to consider those challenges, the instructions properly instructed the jury that they were required to make a finding of dangerousness under the recommitment standard. Applying that standard, the jury in effect found that the mentally ill individual was dangerous to himself or others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction arose from her actions outside a clinic that performed abortions. Defendant and several other individuals locked themselves to a pipe which was welded to a van parked in front of the clinic's entrance. On appeal from her conviction, defendant claimed that: (1) the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion when it admitted irrelevant evidence; (2) the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion in instructing the jury; (3) remarks during the prosecutor's opening statement violated her constitutional right against self-incrimination; (4) the complaint was sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss; and (5) the trial court erred in refusing to strike the testimony of a fire chief despite the State's failure to provide defendant with a copy of the fire chief's written incident report prior to trial. The first four arguments were held to be without merit. The court held that the State was obligated under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.24(1) to give defendant a copy of the fire chief's report because it contained written statements of a witness testifying on behalf of the State. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment, but did not order the verdict set aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the 55-mile per hour speed limit of Wis.

Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in entering a default judgment that violated his right to due process. The trial court entered a default judgment after finding that defendant was given notice and that he did not appear or post a cash bond. Defendant's failure to appear was treated as a no contest plea, and the trial court found him guilty. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.30, jurisdiction over actions for violations of traffic regulations was conferred upon circuit courts. Therefore, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the violation. The court held that the trial court properly followed the procedures of Wis. Stat. &sect; 345.37(1)(b) in considering the nonappearance to be a plea of no contest and in entering the default judgment. It was not error for the trial court to issue the default judgment when defendant did not appear in court at the specified time.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the injunction because the blockading activities were a legal nuisance. The protestors' affidavits were inadequate where they were conclusory and without evidentiary facts. The injunction was proper due to a sufficient probability that the protestors' future conduct would have violated rights and caused irreparable injuries and the balance of equities was in favor of the city and state. There was no violation of the First, Ninth, or Tenth Amendments because they did not protect activities that were a nuisance. Also, the injunction was narrowly tailored to burden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest. The injunction was not vague or overbroad. The state did not have to seek leave of the court under Wis. Stat. &sect; 823.02 to file the action and the state and city could have joined together in the petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with possession of cocaine base with intent to deliver and delivery of cocaine base. The lower court ordered that the state crime lab conduct additional analysis, requested by each defendant, on alleged cocaine base. The state appealed. Defendants cross-appealed the lower court's orders denying their motions to dismiss on the ground that the statute proscribing possession and delivery of cocaine, Wis.

On appeal, the court concluded that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the crime lab to perform certain tests because the lab was capable of performing the tests, the costs were relatively low, defendants could not pay for testing at another lab, and the test results could help the jury in its deliberations. The court also concluded that defendants did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the possession and delivery statute because their challenge did not involve rights protected by the First Amendment.

Respondent mother had initiated the action to terminate the father's parental rights on the basis of abandonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to their separation, the parties lived in Washington. The mother took the son with her to Wisconsin and was later awarded sole custody of him. The father had little contact with his son during the next six years and was in arrears in child support payments. At the time of the trial, the father was incarcerated and participated via telephone. The trial court determined that the mother lacked the assets to pay for the father's transportation to attend the hearing. Affirming both orders, the court held that the father's participation via telephone did not violate his procedural due process rights because he was able to hear and participate in all aspects of the trial. The court upheld the constitutionality of the both the 15-day time limit in which to file a notice of appeal under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.107(5) and the 45-day time limit for the appellate court to issue its decision under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.107(6). Because each of these time limitations could be extended upon request, the limitations did not violate the separation of powers, or interfere with procedural due process or equal protection guarantees. The father's trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant juvenile charged with battery of a prisoner in violation of Wis. Stat. 940.20(1), appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which overturned the holding of a court commissioner that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48.183, 970.032, and 939.635, under which the adult criminal court obtained jurisdiction of the juvenile were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile also appealed from a subsequent holding of the juvenile court, that it did not have jurisdiction over the proceeding because of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.183. The appeals were consolidated. The statutes waived juveniles who committed battery while in a juvenile correctional facility to the jurisdiction of adult criminal courts, and set a minimum sentence of three years for the offense. The court held that the juvenile did not have a substantive due process right to individualized treatment either in the waiver procedure, or in sentencing because it was neither explicitly nor inherently found in the U.S. Constitution; therefore, rational basis review was appropriate. The court noted that the legislature had a rational basis for seeking to control increasing violence in juvenile correctional facilities, and was empowered to simulate a healthy school-like environment for juveniles. The court concluded that there was ample justification for setting a presumptive minimum sentence for juveniles who committed acts of battery within a secured institution, but not for adults who committed similar acts. The court held that the state classifications were neither arbitrary nor irrational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The doctor diagnosed the patient with a heart murmur when he was four years old. The doctor told the patient's mother that the murmur was only functional and would disappear in time. When the patient was over 10 years old, he underwent a physical examination for insurance purposes, where physicians discovered that he had severe systolic hypertension in his upper extremities. The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting partial summary judgment for defendants. The court determined that the patient's action was barred under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 893.55 and 893.56 because the action was commenced more than five years from the date of the doctor's act or omission and after the patient reached 10 years of age. The court determined that &sect; 893.55(1)(b) was not unconstitutional because it did not irrationally or arbitrarily create a classification of immune tortfeasors. Statutes of limitations were policy considerations within the province of the legislature. The five-year discovery limitation for medical malpractice claims was a distinct time period and consistent with the act's purpose. The statute applied to all health care providers in the state equally.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the affidavit supporting issuance of a search warrant of his home was inadequate to support a finding of probable cause, and that his prosecution violated the establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a priest, grew marijuana in his basement for sacramental use. Police, acting on anonymous tip, obtained a warrant and found the plants. On appeal, the court held that the search warrant was valid and that defendant's arguments regarding his First Amendment rights had been rejected in an earlier case. The affidavit was valid because of the detail provided by the informer and evidence of high electrical usage patterns in defendant's home tended to reduce the chances that the tip was false. Although statements in the affidavit that defendant's electrical usage was substantially higher than that of other homes in the area were false, because the statement was not made intentionally or recklessly, the affidavit withstood the Franks test for a challenge to a warrant affidavit on the basis of false information. The court rejected defendant's establishment of religion argument because there was little difference between that argument and a previously rejected proposition that the Native American Church's exemption from prosecution under Wis.

The court held that the Board did not exceed its authority in establishing the requirements for licensure by endorsement. The rules were designed to effectuate the purpose of the statute by ensuring that applicants were properly qualified. The court also held that &sect; 4.01(1) did not create an unconstitutional classification in denial of the applicant's equal protection rights. The rules did not permit licensure if the applicant failed the national examination in Wisconsin or elsewhere. The mistaken licensure by forfeiture of two foreign veterinarians who had failed the examination in another state did not render the rules themselves invalid.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 947.01, 939.05. The State had not provided the defense with the report of a fire chief that was made regarding the subject incident, and the trial court denied the defense a mistrial that was sought on the basis of the denial of the report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had been found inside a van that was blocking an abortion clinic entrance, and inside the van his arm was apparently locked inside a pipe that was affixed to the van. At trial, upon cross-examination of the fire chief that had been dispatched to dislodge defendant, the defense found out about his report. Defendant relied on Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.24 for the right to the report, and the court rejected the arguments of the State that &sect; 971.24 only applied to statements of witnesses called to testify on behalf of the State made to authorities and to statements prepared by an investigating authority. The court held that &sect; 971.24 put no such restrictions on the type of statement that had to be provided to the opposing party. Because the report was not part of the record on appeal, the court was unable to determine whether or not the error in failing to disclose the report was harmless. The report had to be produced on remand. The court rejected defendant's other arguments, including one that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) on appeal from a municipal court decision, Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for armed robbery, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.32(1)(a), and the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief, focusing his allegations on the trial court's determinations that he was arrested lawfully, and on errors he contended occurred during the trial. The court affirmed the judgments and orders, reviewing the trial court's historical findings on a clearly erroneous standard, and analyzed de novo the legal issue of whether there was a constitutional violation. Among the issues raised on appeal, defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel with regard to the alleged failure by the trial counsel to adequately investigate the case and by the denial of his right to testify on his own behalf. After applying the two-pronged Strickland test to defendant's arguments, the court determined that defendant failed to allege with specificity what further investigation would have revealed and how it would have altered the outcome of the trial. Further, defendant had a fair trial and that there was no reasonable likelihood of a different outcome on retrial if he were to have testified.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that the State violated his rights to a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense when it destroyed the tape recording of his 911 telephone call because the tape would have illustrated that he was alert and in full possession of his faculties. The court upheld the convictions. The district attorney requested the tapes but was informed that the tape had been cleared and used to record other calls.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DHSS hearing officer found that the owner, also a registered nurse, violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 50.09(1)(L) by providing nursing care to CBRF residents and violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 50.09(1)(e) by yelling at a resident. On appeal, the court first determined that its scope of review for revocation of the owner's CBRF licenses was do novo because the scope of Wis. Stat. &sect; 50.01(1g) was a matter of first impression. The court then held that the DHSS applied the proper legal standard when it concluded that the owner failed to obtain prior physician approval for nursing assistance provided to CBRF residents. Wis. Stat. &sect; 50.01(1g) defined a CBRF as a place where no nursing care was provided to residents. The court held that the record supported the findings that the owner provided nursing care to residents on three occasions: a resident was administered a laxative in an amount exceeding a doctor's order; the owner removed a resident's bowel obstruction without a doctor's order; and the owner used shortening from the kitchen to perform a nursing procedure on a patient, potentially contaminating the patient with food particles, all violations of Wis.

Those attorneys in the county were given the option to remain in the county retirement system or to transfer to the state retirement system.

The trial court ordered that the county had a duty to transfer the contributions pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 978.12(5)(c)5. The county argued that the contributions were impossible to calculate, that it did not have a duty to transfer contributions, and that &sect; 978.12(5)(c)5 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order because after examining the content, subject matter, scope, and objective of &sect; 978.12(5)(c)5, the county clearly had a duty to transfer the contributions after the attorneys' job category switched from county to state employee. Furthermore, amounts of contributions were readily available from actuarial reports and records maintained by the county.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs in a class action suit appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment for defendant municipalities, concluding that the municipalities' ordinances prohibiting &quot;cruising&quot; were constitutional. Plaintiffs were ticketed for violation of the ordinances and they filed the suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs alleged that the cruising ordinances were unconstitutional; that the municipalities' cruising ordinances were violative of the police powers doctrine; and that state law preempted the municipalities' regulation of &quot;cruising.&quot; The court found that the ordinances did not violate the constitutional right to travel, or the right of privacy. The court held that the right to travel did not guarantee the right to drive a car repeatedly on the same street. Moreover, driving a car was a privilege, not a right, and driving a car exposed the driver to less of an expectation of privacy. The court would not engage in an overbreadth analysis because First Amendment rights were not implicated. Prohibiting cruising did not infringe on plaintiffs' right of freedom of association, and the prohibition did not infringe upon the right to freely move about one's community. The ordinances were reasonably related to the public purpose of preventing a threat to public health, safety and welfare. Therefore, passing the cruising ordinances was a valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection conducted a warrantless inspection of the farmer's premises, it issued a notice of its intent to suspend the farmer's license. However, the license was not suspended. The farmer asserted that the warrantless inspection violated his Fourth Amendment rights because the search was made without prior notification and without his presence and the inspectors had unbridled discretion to search his property and belongings. The Department determined that the warrantless searches were proper but refused to consider the constitutional issue. The trial court entered a judgment affirming the Department's decision and dismissing the farmer's petition for review. On appeal, the court concluded that the statutory scheme provided adequate constitutional protection for warrantless searches and affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the petition. The court held that warrantless and unannounced inspections were necessary to further the State's interest in regulating dairy farms and to preserve the public health and safety. In addition, the court noted that there was no evidence of abuse by the Department.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of first-degree murder and armed robbery, both as a party to a crime. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting nontestimonial derivative evidence after suppressing his confession for violation of his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amend V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the trial court concluded that defendant's Miranda rights were violated but that his confession was voluntary, it denied defendant's motion to suppress the physical evidence, including the murder weapon. On review, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court's ruling that defendant's confession was voluntary was supported by the evidence presented at the suppression hearing. The trial court properly admitted the physical evidence because derivative, non-testimonial evidence was admissible when its discovery resulted from a suppressed, but voluntary confession. The arguable benefits from excluding such evidence were far outweighed by the advantages of having relevant and probative evidence, not obtained by actual coercion, available at trial to aid in the pursuit of truth. Although defendant contended that he should have been granted a new trial because a juror, who became the foreperson, was exposed to a newspaper article that referred to defendant's suppressed confession, the court noted that, following an individual voir dire of the juror, defense counsel did not object to the juror and thus waived this issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The landowners later filed a petition for exclusion or removal of property from the sanitary district with defendant town board of supervisors, which denied their petition. The landowners requested that the town board reconsider its decision because it failed to consider the petition as one for exclusion from the sanitary district under Wis.

Without the developer's knowledge, the city, at the request of a neighboring property owner, held hearings on the issues of rezoning the site for single-family residential use and of imposing a moratorium on building permits. The developer became aware of the city's actions but continued to seek the city's assistance with compliance issues before learning that the building permit would not issue. The court, finding no abuse of discretion, affirmed the trial court's grant of mandamus. The court determined that the city had a positive and plain duty to issue the permit, to which the developer had a clear legal right.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a judgment was entered against defendant in a civil forfeiture action, the court ordered that defendant would be subject to a six-month jail sentence under Wis.

The court concluded that defendant had failed to demonstrate that &sect; 778.09 was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt or that the six-month jail sentence in the event of nonpayment violated his equal protection rights. The court therefore affirmed the trial court's judgment and order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance assessing impact fees as a condition of obtaining a building permit was unconstitutional. The trial court determined that appellants lacked standing to contest the validity of the ordinance because no one had applied for a building permit and had not been assessed the impact fee, they had not suffered any injury, no justiciable controversy was presented, and plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The court reversed. The complaint's allegations were sufficient to confer standing. Owners of real estate had standing to challenge the diminishment of their property's value by means of an unconstitutional ordinance, and businesses had a legally protectable interest in preventing injury to their businesses. Because the complaint alleged the ordinance in fact injured the plaintiffs' property and businesses a justiciable controversy was present. A case was ripe when the facts were sufficiently developed to admit conclusive adjudication.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant struck an oncoming vehicle while he made a left turn in front of the vehicle. The driver and her two children were seriously injured. Another motorist called for an ambulance. When the motorist returned, defendant was gone. Defendant arrived at his girlfriend's house and told her roommate that he had had been drinking and that he left the scene of the accident because he would go to jail. Defendant refused to call the police, as suggested. The police tested defendant's blood for tetrahydrocannabinols (THC) after they obtained a warrant to test his blood alcohol level. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that: (1) once the police came into lawful possession of the blood samples, defendant lost any expectation of privacy, and the police could test for the presence of THC without violating defendant's Fourth Amendment rights; (2) the trial court properly excluded evidence of the driver's negligence because the law imposed strict criminal liability on one who injured another while operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances; and (3) defendant did not have a defense of necessity because natural forces did not cause the accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The licensee was a registered nurse. In revoking her licenses, DHSS found that she had performed rectal examinations, gave a resident an enema, yelled at a resident, and taken other actions that were prohibited in CBRFs by Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 50.01(1g), .09(1)(L), (1)(e). The licensee asserted that DHSS used an incorrect legal standard to revoke her licenses, that the standard used was unconstitutionally vague, that certain findings were unsupported by substantial evidence, and that license revocation was an inappropriate sanction. The court affirmed the judgment. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 50.01(1g), a CBRF was a place where no nursing care was provided to residents. Substantial evidence, consisting of the licensee's own concessions, the testimony of a CBRF employee, and other evidence supported the findings of DHSS that the licensee improperly provided nursing services on several occasions. The notice of intent to revoke the licenses provided the licensee with adequate notice of the factual and legal basis for the revocation. Although not all the charges against the licensee were proven, the license revocation was based on the four proven charges and it was not an excessive sanction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was hired to write specialized computer software. Concerned that he would not be paid for his work due to the work's quality, defendant created programs to delete computer data.

Defendant brought a motion to dismiss the information, alleging that federal copyright law pre-empted the state statute, that the statute was vague and unenforceable, impaired his right to contract, constituted involuntary servitude, and violated his equal protection rights. The trial court denied defendant's motion, holding that pre-emption did not apply and that the destruction was of the company's data, not defendant's program. The trial court entered a conviction. Defendant appealed. The reviewing court affirmed, finding that where defendant did not have a copyright on the company's data, the statute did not result in defendant's financial loss, defendant was not being forced to fill contract terms, and the statute was not vague or overbroad, the conviction was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.30(2)(a) was unconstitutional because it was unduly vague and ambiguous. Because the court had previously upheld the statute against the same challenge, it did not address that argument. Defendant also argued that the trial court misused its discretion by admitting photographs of the victim into evidence and functioning as an advocate for the state, and thereby demonstrating bias towards defendant. The court found that the trial court applied the proper legal standards to the facts of record to reach a reasonable conclusion. Admission of the photographs was proper because they related to the issue that the victim was exposed to bodily harm. The trial court properly directed counsel to comment upon what he expected to prove by way of a defense. The court concluded that the trial judge did not violate defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial because no bias was apparent from the record. The basis for defendant's motion for a new trial was trial court error, which the court had determined to be meritless. No substantial probability existed, therefore, that a new trial would have produced a different result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This case continued the decade-long dispute between the Sewerage District and municipalities outside of the district, over the municipalities respective share of the Sewerage District's annual capital costs. The dispute centered around funding for the Sewerage District's capital improvement program known as the Water Pollution Abatement Project. The sole issue on appeal was whether the Sewerage District's property value based method was permissible under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.91(5)(c). The Commission ruled that the Sewerage District's method of allocating capital costs to the municipalities based on property values was reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory, and was authorized by &sect; 66.91(5)(c)2. The municipalities did not appeal the Commission's findings that the property value method was reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory. Instead, the municipalities argued that &sect; 66.91(5)(c) did not provide the Sewerage District with the authority to charge on a property value basis in this case. The court agreed with the Commission that the Sewerage District's use of property values in this case was permissible under &sect; 66.91(5)(c), by the plain language of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a bench trial in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), defendant was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and burglary, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.01(1) and 943.10(1)(a). The trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison, with parole eligibility in 2028, for the homicide, and to a concurrent 10-year prison term for the burglary. Defendant appealed; his counsel filed a no-merit report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of killing the victim and burglarizing her residence. The victim had been repeatedly struck with a hibachi grill, and there was evidence of strangulation. A witness identified defendant as the man he saw carrying property later identified as the victim's from her backyard. Defendant admitted entering the residence to burglarize it, but he claimed to have no memory of anything else. Affirming the conviction and sentence, the court rejected defendant's claim that an interrogating officer's &quot;false friend&quot; approach made several of his statements to the officer involuntary. The life sentence and parole eligibility date were not inappropriate; although defendant's life was shattered by alcohol and drug abuse and he had taken some positive steps in his life, the slaying was brutal and committed intentionally to eliminate a witness. The crime was planned against a handpicked, vulnerable victim. Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.10 was not unconstitutional as failing to distinguish between burglary and breaking and entering; burglary by definition required only the entry into a home with the intention of stealing or committing a felony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The PSI contained inaccuracies about defendant's prior inpatient treatment. He moved the trial court to modify his sentence based in part on these inaccuracies. Although the sentence was later modified and he was placed on probation, he never sought modification of his PSI. When probation was revoked, his motion to strike the PSI was denied on grounds of waiver and public policy. Based on the procedural posture of the case, the court concluded that the motion was properly denied. The trial court had no express authority to grant the relief requested. Policy principles and considerations of judicial administration dictated that courts should not exercise their jurisdiction to correct a PSI for reasons solely related to the Department of Corrections Administration. Defendant's motion to correct his sentence was properly denied. Under &sect; 939.32(1), a sentence for an attempted crime was half the maximum sentence for the completed crime. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.50(3)(c), the maximum sentence for sexual assault was 10 years. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.62(1)(b, defendant's sentence could be increased up to six years based on his repeater status. The 11-year sentence was correctly calculated.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even though &sect; 9.17 did not include meaningful criteria by which approval of mobile home park zoning was governed, the standards provided in &sect; 9.17 were sufficient because it provided sufficient guidance and adequate criteria for judicial review of the City's decision on a petition. The builder argue that &sect; 9.17 was violative of equal protection.

The court affirmed, holding that a party had a constitutional right to have a statutory claim tried to a jury when the statute codified an action known to the common law in 1848 and when the action was regarded as at law in 1848.

The judgment prohibited suspension of drivers' licenses for nonpayment of forfeitures arising from non-traffic related offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Members of the class had individually received orders from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation suspending their drivers' licenses for failure to pay fines imposed by municipal court judges for non-traffic charges. The class claimed that municipal courts were precluded from suspending operating licenses for nonpayment of forfeitures for violations of non-traffic city ordinances under Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.30(5). The trial court had determined that statutory authority for suspension was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, reversed the judgment, and held that under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 800.09 and 800.095, municipal court judges had such authority and, further, that the statutory authority was constitutional. The court ruled that the lack of reference in Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.30(5) to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 800.09, 800.095 was inadvertent and that the interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.30(5) had to include the insertion of references to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city relocated a creek by creating a concrete channel upon its bed without securing a permit from the appropriate authorities.

Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.055 provided that the city was not required to secure permits with regard to the creek. The court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.055 was a private or local law and, as such, was subject to the requirements of Wis. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1950, the city council passed an ordinance authorizing the use of fluorine in the city's water. From many years the city used sodium fluoride as the fluoridation agent and later it used hydrofluosilicic acid. Both compounds were approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for fluoridation. In response to the oversight in the ordinance in not specifying the other two compounds, the city passed an amendment authorizing fluoridation as approved by the DNR. At a hearing on the matter the group expressed its concern for the use of fluoridation in water. The group alleged that fluoride needlessly exposed residents to health dangers, while numerous other doctors stated that the additive would benefit dental health. The trial court froze discovery pending the outcome of the parties' summary judgment motions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the city. The court held that the city properly exercised its powers in further the health and welfare of the city by way of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which affirmed a decision of respondent, the Department of Corrections (DOC), determining the inmate's mandatory release date pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 302.11 (1984). The DOC classified the inmate as subject to &sect; 302.11 even though some of the conduct for which the inmate was convicted occurred prior to the effective date of the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1988, the inmate was convicted of 23 felony counts and one misdemeanor count. The DOC calculated the inmate's mandatory release date by applying &sect; 302.11, which became effective on June 1, 1984. The DOC asserted that classifying the inmate under the new law was the most rational choice because 20 of his 24 convictions were for offenses that occurred, at least in part, after the effective date of the statute. The DOC further claimed that its choice was consistent with the Legislature's intent to provide for a later mandatory release date. The inmate argued, inter alia, that applying the new law to him had an unconstitutional ex post facto effect. The court found that it was not the new law that caused the inmate's reclassification but his conviction for offenses that he committed after the effective date of the new law, for which the trial court imposed sentences to run concurrently with the inmate's previous sentence. Although the sentences for new offenses may have disrupted the inmate's expectation of serving the entirety of his original sentence under the old law, he put that expectation at risk by continuing to commit offenses after the effective date of the new law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oil company and the State entered into a contract for the purchase of State-owned land at a highway interchange. Spite the fact that the oil company was the only developer to submit an offer, the State rejected its offer to purchase and returned a down payment. The trial court dismissed the oil company's action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The State had not consented to be sued for specific performance of a contract for the sale of State surplus real estate. The court declined to adopt the reasoning of other jurisdictions and conclude that by authorizing the DOT to enter into contracts for the sale of State-owned land, the Wisconsin Legislature intended that such contracts be enforceable and binding on both parties and thus the legislature consented to such suits to enforce these contracts. It was not for the courts in Wisconsin to preempt the legislature's function to determine when and how it may be sued. A remedy was available to the oil company in that Wis. Stats. ch. 16 provided a procedure for submitting a claim to a state claims commission which could recommend to the Legislature that the claim be paid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court unconstitutionally prejudiced the credibility of his theory when it refused to allow three defense witnesses to testify about the accuser's cocaine use and prostitution activities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff alleged that defendants violated the unfair trade provisions of Wis.

Plaintiff also alleged that the supplier violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 133.04 by engaging in price discrimination between different purchasers. A jury awarded damages to plaintiff on both claims. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the trial court erred in instructing the jury to apply the ordinary burden of proof because civil damage claims alleging violations of &sect;&sect; 133.04 and 133.05 required the &quot;middle&quot; standard of proof -- clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence -- and, thus, defendants were entitled to a new trial; (2) section 133.05(2) required plaintiff to prove that defendant contractor knew that any unearned discounts, special services, or privileges it received were secret and that they were not extended to all purchasers on like terms and conditions; and (3) defendant contractor failed to demonstrate that &sect; 133.05 was void for vagueness, even though &quot;unearned discounts&quot; and &quot;like terms and conditions&quot; were not defined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order of the circuit court (Wisconsin), which dismissed charges against defendant of homicide by negligent operation of a vehicle. Defendant cross-appealed the trial court's ruling that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.10, 939.25 were not unconstitutionally vague in violation of his equal protection and due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with homicide by negligent operation of a vehicle. On defendant's motions to dismiss the complaint, the trial court found sufficient probable cause and concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.10 was not unconstitutionally vague. However, it dismissed the complaint based on the State's failure to rebut defendant's prima facie claim of discriminatory prosecution. On appeal by both sides, the court reversed as to the finding of discriminatory prosecution and otherwise affirmed. Defendant failed to show that the prosecution was motivated by a desire to deny his constitutional right or a desire to adversely affect him. Even if defendant had made such a prima facie showing, the prosecutor validly exercised his prosecutorial discretion because the prosecution was based on reevaluation of the applicable law. The other factors considered, such as the extent of harm and the deterrent effect of prosecution, showed a rational basis for a charging decision. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the phrase &quot;ordinary negligence to a high degree&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, and the evidence provided probable cause for the conclusion that defendant committed vehicular homicide.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that a reasonable probability was a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. The court found no prejudice in defense counsel's failure to cross-examine a witness regarding inconsistencies in his testimony. The court opined that it was a reasonable strategic to permit testimony regarding a prior violent incident involving defendant that otherwise would have been inadmissible in an effort to impeach several State witnesses. Because the witness who refused to testify was entitled to be advised of his Fifth Amendment rights, the court found no due process violation when the witness invoked those rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff university foundation appealed a judgment for the Circuit Court of La Crosse County (Wisconsin), which dismissed its action against defendants, a town and a county, for a refund of real estate taxes paid on an arboretum and a declaration that the arboretum was exempt from general property taxes under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(20).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although a county board had not approved a property tax exemption for the arboretum as authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(20), the foundation sought a tax refund and a declaration of the arboretum's tax-exempt status. The circuit court dismissed the foundation's action because the county board had not approved the exemption. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal by finding that the circuit court reached the right result for the wrong reason. The court held that &sect; 70.11(20) was unconstitutional because the delegation of power to the county board to approve or disapprove a property tax exemption violated the state constitution in many respects. The power to grant tax exemptions was vested solely in the legislature under Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, and was not a power of a local, legislative, and administrative character which the legislature could delegate to a county board under Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. Further, Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(20) violated the uniformity clause, Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The part of Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.11(20) which required the county board to approve the tax exemption could not be severed from the remainder of the statute to preserve its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Circuit Court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), for enticement of a child with the intent of exposure, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.07(3), arguing that &sect; 948.07(3) violated his constitutional rights to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant challenged only the constitutionality of the child enticement statute and subsequent conviction. The court examined the statute under the rational basis analysis because defendant's claim did not involve fundamental rights or a suspect criterion. Defendant argued that the statutory penalty scheme of the child enticement statute was irrational. He asserted that there was no reason why enticement to commit the act of exposure, a Class C felony, should be more serious and thus have a greater penalty than the act of exposure itself, a Class A misdemeanor. The court held the gravamen of the crime was not the commission of an enumerated act, but succeeding in getting a child to enter a place with intent to commit such a crime. Defendant's second, related issue was whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.07(3) was unconstitutional as applied to him. He argued that he was denied equal protection because it was irrational for &sect; 948.07(1) to distinguish between acts against children under and over the age of 16, while &sect; 948.07(3) applied to acts against children of any age. The court agreed with the state that this distinction was not a basis for an equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with eight distinct assaults. Charges relating to one of the assaults were severed, and defendant was convicted of six assaults and related crimes. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion in failing to sever certain counts, finding that the initial joinder of the charges was proper because all of the incidents occurred within a very limited geographic area, each incident involved a young, black female who was traveling alone, each incident involved the use or threat of use of a weapon, and all of the incidents took place over a relatively short period of time. The court also concluded that the trial court properly considered the prejudice resulting from its failure to sever the offenses. The trial court did not deny defendant his right to due process of law and a fair trial by not dismissing certain counts based upon destruction of allegedly exculpatory evidence where defendant failed to show bad faith on the part of the police. Line-up procedures used to identify defendant were not unduly suggestive. There was sufficient evidence to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city filed an action against defendant church, after it refused to pay a public fire protection charge, seeking a declaration that Wis. Stat. &sect; 196.03(3)(b) was constitutional and that the charge was a fee, not a tax. The Circuit Court for Pierce County (Wisconsin) held that &sect; 196.03(3)(B) was constitutional and was a fee. The church sought review of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court noted that (1) the charge could be imposed by either a public or a private water utility, (2) the city imposed the charge in its capacity as a utility to pay its operational expenses, not as a municipality to collect revenue, and (3) nonpayment of the charge did not result in a lien on the customer's property. On appeal, the church argued that the trial court erred by concluding that &sect; 196.03(3)(b) imposed a fee and not an unconstitutional tax on otherwise tax exempt properties. The court found that the difference between taxes and fees was that the primary purpose of a tax was to obtain revenue for the government, while the primary purpose of a fee was to cover the expense of providing a service or of regulation and supervision of certain activities. The charge was a fee and not a tax because the primary purpose of the charge was to cover the expense of making water available, storing water, and ensuring that water would be delivered in case it was needed to fight fires. The fact that the charge lacked some of the common characteristics of a tax supported the conclusion that the charge was a fee and not a tax.</SPAN></P>

The lower court dismissed the action as time-barred under &sect; 893.88 and the court affirmed the dismissal. The court found that Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 was not violated by the dismissal of the action because the statute gave the son 19 years within which to file an action and the father was entitled to be free from the claim under the statute at a certain point. The court determined that the statute of limitations in the statute was a reasonable limitation imposed by the legislature. The court reversed the award of costs and attorney's fees to the alleged father because the son and mother's cause of action was supported by a substantial argument for modification of the existing law and the fact that they did not prevail did not render their action frivolous.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the decision, the court held that the commission acted within the law when it denied the prisoner parole. In addition, the commission's determination that the prisoner posed an &quot;unreasonable risk to the public&quot; was authorized by Wis. Adm. Code &sect; PAC 1.06(7)(e), and its decision to deny parole on that basis had a rational basis in the record. Under the plain language of &sect; PAC 1.06(7), the failure to attend SOTP was a permissible ground for denying parole.

On appeal, she claimed that the double jeopardy clause barred the second prosecution. Affirming, the court held that the double jeopardy clause was not implicated because the county action was a civil action rather than a criminal prosecution and the civil action did not result in the imposition of a criminal punishment but in a civil forfeiture. Also, the elements of the civil offense and criminal offense were not identical as required for application of the double jeopardy clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis.

The court found that the statute was clear as it applied to the unlicensed business operator because he admitted that he assisted employers in obtaining employees for a fee.

The purchasers sued the Department, claiming that the &quot;manufacturers' rebates&quot; they received in connection with their purchases should not have been subject to the five percent state sales tax. The Department filed a motion to dismiss asserting that sovereign immunity barred the action. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint. The purchasers appealed. The court stated that the test for whether the principle of sovereign immunity applied was whether the relief sought would have required payment from state funds. The court stated that there was no question that the purchasers were seeking to recover funds from the state. The court held that the Department was immune from suit.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 343.305(4). One defendant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI), which followed the denial of his motion to suppress the chemical test result. A second defendant sought review of the revocation of his operator's license for refusing to take the test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants each held a regular Wisconsin driver's license at the time of his arrest for OWI. Before asking defendants to submit to chemical tests, the arresting officers advised them of all warnings required under the implied consent law, Wis. Stat. &sect;343.305(4), including those that pertained to commercial vehicle operation. One defendant took the test and was subsequently convicted of OWI. The other refused the test and his license was revoked after a hearing. On appeal, defendants argued that the delivery of the commercial motor vehicle warnings to noncommercial operators violated the public policy and objectives of the implied consent law. Defendants agreed that each arresting officer followed the mandates of the implied consent law to the letter, by advising defendants of all required warnings, but claimed that such full compliance was fatal. The court ruled that the illogic of the argument was self-evident and that the officers could not have violated the statute by following it. The court also held that the delivery of the commercial motor vehicle warnings, to a suspect who only held a regular license, did not violate equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed the report and agreed that there was no arguable merit to any issue that could be raised on appeal. The trial court did not misuse its discretion when it excluded evidence that the victim was intoxicated, potentially suicidal, and had been involved in an altercation several hours before he was killed by defendant. Evidence of the victim's other wrongs or acts was not admissible to prove defendant acted in self-defense where there was no evidence that defendant knew of the prior wrongs or acts. For the same reason, information concerning the victim's prior criminal record would not have been admissible and the prosecution's failure to produce that information until the third day of trial was not grounds for a mistrial. The homicide sentence was based on a consideration of the requisite factors, was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion, and the trial court was authorized to set a parole eligibility date that was later than would otherwise apply pursuant to Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment and an order of the Circuit Court for Dunn County (Wisconsin), which denied his request for postconviction relief after the jury found him not guilty of attempted murder but guilty of aggravated battery. Defendant contended that charging him with both aggravated battery and attempted intentional homicide for the same act was improper because the two crimes were inconsistent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and a friend attacked the victim. Defendant argued that the victim was the aggressor. The state initially charged defendant with attempted intentional homicide; it later charged him with aggravated battery. On appeal, defendant contended that he was impermissibly charged with inconsistent crimes for the same act and that the trial court erred by denying his request for a lesser included offense instruction on the negligent use of a weapon. The court ruled that because defendant was convicted of, and therefore punished for, only one crime that it need not address a double jeopardy argument. As to the request for a lesser included offense instruction, the court concluded that the error, if any, was harmless and did not cause any prejudice. The court also held that because there were two persons charged with causing the victim's injuries, defendant and his friend, the trial court correctly determined that it would make the most sense to hold defendant's restitution hearing in conjunction with his co-defendant's hearing. Consequently, defendant was required to wait until the conclusion of the co-defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>

The mother filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. After a hearing, the trial court granted the grandmother visitation. On appeal by the mother, the court affirmed. The court held that, pursuant to case law, the trial court had jurisdiction over the grandmother's petition because (1) there was an underlying paternity action over which the trial court had jurisdiction, and (2) the child's family was not intact because the father did not live with the mother and the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.29, which forbid a convicted felon from possessing a firearm, was adopted after he had completed his sentence for a felony conviction and, as applied to him, was an ex post facto law. In affirming, the court ruled that in claimed ex post facto cases--where unpleasant consequences might be visited on an individual for prior conduct--the question was whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual came about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation. The court held that the plain &quot;legislative aim&quot; of &sect; 941.29 was protection of the public safety and that had the statute been intended as additional punishment for persons previously convicted of felonies, the legislature would not have provided various methods of obtaining relief from the prohibition against firearm possession. The court further held that applying &sect; 941.29 to convicted felons, regardless of the date of the conviction, did not transform the statute into an unconstitutional ex post facto law, even though it bore harshly upon the person affected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The power company claimed as a charitable deduction the value of land it donated to the federal government for a scenic riverway. The department disallowed the deduction and assessed additional tax. The Tax Appeals Commission denied the company's petition for redetermination. The circuit court affirmed the order dismissing the company's petition for review. On appeal, the company raised an equal protection claim and the court held that the company's failure to bring this claim resulted in its waiver on appeal. Thereafter, the company brought a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against the department's past and present secretaries to prevent the collection of the tax. The court noted that a &sect; 1983 action could only be brought by taxpayers who had exhausted their administrative remedies, including judicial review. Because the company did not raise the equal protection issue before the commission, the court affirmed, finding that it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and could not attack the additional franchise tax imposed on it on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was entered for defendant. Three days later, defendant filed notice of entry of judgment with the clerk of the court and claimed to have sent a copy to plaintiffs.

The court held that the presumption that mail sent was received was rebuttable. The court ruled that if the presumption was not rebuttable then it would have been unconstitutional as a violation of the Due Process Clause. The court concluded that plaintiffs should have had an opportunity to demonstrate that they did not receive the notice of entry of judgment, thereby making their notice of appeal timely. The court held that rebutting the presumption required a factual determination, and therefore the case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and the victim had dated for several years and the relationship, while volatile at times, had not been violent. One evening, defendant became heavily intoxicated; the couple argued and, as defendant became aggressive, the victim unsuccessfully attempted to leave his company. On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could not consider evidence of the couple's prior consensual sexual contacts to determine whether the victim had consented to sexual intercourse on the date of the incident. The court agreed but, finding the error harmless, affirmed the conviction. The court, noting that the state had the burden to prove nonconsent, reasoned that although the jury should have been able to consider the prior consensual contact, the error was harmless because evidence of consent to prior non-violent contact was of no probative value regarding consent to sexual intercourse under the threat or use of violence. Also, rejecting defendant's arguments to the contrary, the court determined that &sect; 940.225(2)(a) did not require the state to prove intent and was not unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that a substantial change of circumstances existed and that the son's best interests supported awarding sole legal custody and primary physical placement to the mother. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that it considered the appropriate factors. The trial court noted it was the son's wish to remain in his present school's gifted and talented program and to have more contact with his mother. The trial court also noted that the father showed extreme preoccupation with the son, was unaware of his intensity, that the father could not have molded the child without serious danger to the child, and that the father attempted to interfere with the mother-child relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that (1) the complaint charging a violation of the Wisconsin Organized Crime Control Act (WOCCA), Wis.

Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. The disposition of the stolen goods was conducted within the business. That was the infiltration of legitimate business with racketeering money that WOCCA was designed to combat. On its face, and as applied to the facts of the case, the WOCCA definition of &quot;pattern of racketeering activity&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant did not explain in what way the trial court's refusal to grant a continuance affected the quality of assistance her counsel provided, and the court found nothing on that subject in the record.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bank foreclosed upon certain real properties. The homestead exemption under Wis. Stat. &sect; 815.20 was $ 25,000 when the mortgagor signed the promissory notes for the properties. The mortgagor purchased the real estate which he sought to have released from the bank's judgment lien. In the meantime, the homestead exemption under &sect; 815.20 was increased to $ 40,000. The mortgagor sought to use the higher sum to offset the mortgage on the property where he resided. A declaratory suit was filed, and the trial court ruled that $ 40,000 was the proper exemption amount. The bank sought review. The court reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded, holding that under Campbell, in the analogous field of personal property exemptions, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had explicitly held that the amount of the statutory exemption as between debtor and creditor was determined by the amount of the exemption in effect when the contract between them was made.

The court held that there was nothing clearly erroneous in the trial court's factual findings, and defendant consented to an interview with FBI agents. Therefore, defendant was not in police custody.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The putative father sought to vacate a default order of paternity and assignment of his income for child support after blood tests revealed he was not the father of the child in question. The putative father also requested that all moneys wrongfully deducted from his salary be returned to him with interest. The family court entered judgment vacating the judgment of paternity, dismissing the complaint, ordering the refund of $ 200 to the putative father, and denying all other relief. The court found that the putative father's arguments did not establish that the judgment and order assigning his income were unlawful. The court found that there was nothing unjust about the assignment of his income pursuant to the default judgment. The court found that it did not appear that the family court exercised its discretion to consider whether it would have been equitable for respondent State to have retained the money it lawfully collected. The court found that during the time the State was collecting money, the putative father was lawfully adjudicated the father and found that once the judgment was vacated, the State stopped collecting funds.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the case for the family court to determine the just terms for vacating the default judgment and to award the putative father statutory prejudgment interest on whatever amount it determined he was entitled to receive.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the right to a speedy trial encompassed the time from which the person was accused until the time was sentencing. The court stated that the test to determine whether a defendant's speedy trial right was violated was: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) defendant's assertion of his right; and (4) prejudice to defendant. The court held that the 10 month delay was too long, and proceeded to consider the other factors. The court held that although the State asked for the continuances, its reason for delay was to wait for the determination in another court of the constitutionality of a statute, not to prejudice defendant, so the factor did not weigh heavily against the State. The court held that defendant had asserted his right. The court found no prejudice to defendant. Although defendant argued that he suffered anxiety in waiting to know his sentence, the court noted that defendant faced a mandatory life sentence. The court found no prejudice in the lack of programs at the county jail as opposed to state prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court rejected defendant's claim that the trial court lost jurisdiction over him because it did not hold a preliminary hearing within 10 days of the initial appearance as required under Wis. Stat. &sect; 970.03(2). The time limit was extended for cause because defendant had requested substitution of counsel on the day of the preliminary examination. His exercise of his right to substitution waived any time defect. Defendant claimed his statements implicating him in prior harvesting and delivery of marijuana were erroneously admitted. The evidence constituted &quot;other acts&quot; under Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.04 but was admissible to show opportunity, intent, and knowledge as provided under &sect; 904.04(2). The trial court did not misuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. The evidence was also admissible as an admission by a party opponent. The trial court found that counsel's decision not to oppose the State's trial amendment was trial strategy. Based on the record from the postconviction motion hearing, the finding was not clearly erroneous. Because there was no trial error, the court did not grant a new trial in the interest of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When appealing a child support order, the husband claimed that Wis. Adm. Code &sect; HSS 80.04(2), on which the trial court based the calculation of the support amount, was unconstitutional. The court, on appeal, concluded that the husband had waived the constitutionality of the rule because he failed to raise it in the trial court before commencing the appeal. In ruling on the husband's motion for relief from the trial court's order pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.07, the trial court denied the motion on the grounds that, on appeal, the court had expressly allowed application of the rule's standard in the case. The trial court then held that the husband's motion was frivolous and it awarded the wife $ 150 in fees. On appeal, the court modified the amount awarded and affirmed because the husband's attempt to raise the constitutionality issue by seeking relief from the order under &sect; 806.07 did not cure his failure to raise the issue before the order was entered. Because the trial court lacked authority to award attorney's fees, the award was modified to conform with the trial court's discretionary authority under &sect; 814.07 to award up to $ 50 in costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin) that denied her motion for postconviction relief. She was convicted of homicide by the intoxicated use of a vehicle. She argued that her motion should have been granted because her rights to due process and equal protection were denied by the application of Wis. Stat. &sect; 905.13, which prohibited comment upon a witness's claim of privilege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant did not contest the elements of the crime but rather sought to prove the affirmative defense contained in Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(2) that the death would have occurred even if she had been exercising due care and had not been under the influence of an intoxicant. Defendant asserted that the accident and death of her passenger occurred because her car was rear-ended by another driver and was propelled off the road, where it subsequently rolled over. The other driver was called as witness outside of the presence of the jury, and he invoked the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing her requests that the other driver invoke Fifth Amendment privilege in the presence of the jury and that the jury be instructed that it could draw an inference from its invocation. The court disagreed. There were reasonable bases for the divergent treatment that Wis. Stat. &sect; 905.13 accorded criminal and civil defendants regarding comment upon or inference from a claim of privilege. Moreover, despite the trial court's denials, defendant was able to offer significant evidence in support of her intervening cause defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Waupaca County (Wisconsin) convicting him on four counts of soliciting prostitution in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.32, and from an order denying his postconviction motion for a new trial. Defendant claimed that evidence did not sustain convictions on two counts, the counts were mutiplicitous, &sect; 944.32 was unconstitutional as applied, and evidence of other acts was improperly admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant twice solicited two women to pay for sex and to recruit their female acquaintances to pay for sex. Defendant was charged with four counts of solicitation of repeated acts of prostitution in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.32, one count for each time he solicited each woman. Since it was undisputed that the recruited women might elect to actively participate in sexual acts with others, including defendant, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction under the statute. However, because &sect; 944.32 punished solicitation of repeated acts of prostitution, it was error to charge defendant separately for soliciting each individual act of prostitution. This error required only that the trial court on remand amend the judgment to delete the statement of conviction and sentence on two of the counts. Defendant waived his claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied because he failed to raise the issue by a motion before trial, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.31(2). If evidence of other acts by defendant were improperly admitted, the error was harmless because the jury heard substantively identical admissible evidence and the trial judge gave a cautionary instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction on two of the four counts was reversed, the judgment of conviction on the other two counts was affirmed, and the cause was remanded with instructions to the trial court to amendment the judgment to delete the statement of conviction and sentence on the two counts for which the convictions were reversed.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that the requisite number of valid signatures supported a petition asking the board to create the management district pursuant to Wis. Stat. ch. 33, subch. IV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners opposed the creation of the district, based on the required petitions. The trial court rejected the challenges to the county board's creation of the district and dismissed the action. On review, the court affirmed. A county board could create a public inland lake protection and rehabilitation district with over 51 percent of the landowners' signatures on petitions. Petitions were circulated within the proposed district. Each circulator verified his petition. The substantive words of the circulators' statements met the legal requirements for verification. First, each statement recited that it was made under oath. Therefore, the fundamental ingredient which gave a verification its trust and credibility was satisfied. Second, each statement carried the jurat of a notary public, signifying that the writing was sworn to by the person who signed it. Third, every person giving such an oath was deemed to have been lawfully sworn pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 887.03. Moreover, those who wished to withdraw from the petition were obligated to do so before the public hearing commenced. The withdrawals were untimely, unverified, and ineffective.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 947.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a performance artist whose performance consisted of exposing his penis and later his anus, defecating on stage, rubbing feces on his chest and face, tossing feces into the audience, breaking a bottle over his head, simulating fellatio with the microphone, pulling a woman up on stage and pushing her off stage, and biting the breast of another male singer. The jury convicted defendant. The court affirmed. Because &sect; 947.01 conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the fact that abusive and indecent conduct, as measured by common understanding and practices, were proscribed by law, the claim that the statute was unconstitutionally vague had to fail. The statute as written was not overbroad. The combination of conduct and circumstances were crucial in applying the statute. No authority compelled only a prosecution under Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.21, the obscene performance statute. The complaint was not invalid for intertwining protected conduct with conduct that was properly subject to prosecution. A common sense analysis of the complaint indicated that defendant's alleged actions not only tended to create or provoke a disturbance, but had in fact created a disorderly scene.</SPAN></P>

After the filing of cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) granted the city's motion. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs claimed that the pit bull aspects of the ordinance were facially invalid because the definition of &quot;pit bull&quot; was impermissibly vague, the ordinance was overbroad, and it violated their right to equal protection of the law. Rejecting the contention that an ordinary person would not have been able to discern whether a dog was a pit bull as defined by the ordinance, the court held that the ordinance gave residents sufficient notice concerning the type of dog that was subject to its restrictions. The court added that problems of ultimate proof did not make the ordinance unduly vague on its face. With regard to the overbreadth argument, the court noted that the doctrine had no application outside the First Amendment context. Because no fundamental rights or suspect classes were involved, the rational basis standard was used for the equal protection argument. The court acknowledged that reasonable persons might have differed on the import of the material the common council considered regarding the danger the dogs posed. The court concluded that it could not have been said that the ordinance was arbitrary and had no reasonable purpose or reflected no justifiable public policy.</SPAN></P>

Following the procedure in the rule, the guard prepared a notice to the inmate stating that the letter would not be delivered because it concerned an activity which, if completed, would violate the laws of Wisconsin or the United States.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a postconviction motion for a new trial. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed, claiming that he was improperly convicted. The court held that the trial court did not commit error by excluding evidence allegedly implicating a third person in the murder. The evidence was self-contradictory, uncorroborated, and strongly rebutted. Also, the evidence insufficiently demonstrated that the third person had threatened the victim. Even if the victim had been threatened by the third person, the threat was remote in time to the murder. The court also determined that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel's decision to not further investigate evidence possessed by others and to not offer witnesses' testimony into evidence was a matter of trial strategy. In addition, the court stated that defendant failed to demonstrate that the trial court's proceeding to sentencing shortly after the jury returned its verdict caused him prejudice. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's telephonic presence at his postconviction hearing met the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

The insurer asserted that it was entitled to subrogation under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.189 for payments that it made to the insured, a city employee. The city asserted that &sect; 66.189&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated the public purpose doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer was struck by an uninsured motorist and received payments from his insurer. The insurer sought subrogation from the officer's employer, the City of Milwaukee, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.189. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the city but the court reversed this decision. &sect; 66.189 required the city to provide uninsured motorist coverage for its vehicles and effectively made it an insurer for purposes of uninsured motorist's coverage for its employees that drove city-owned vehicles. In determining whether a contractual right of subrogation existed, courts were required to examine the policy, to interpret it as would a reasonable person in the insured's position, and to give ordinary meaning to its language. The court found that the subrogation clause contained within the insurer's policy gave it a right of subrogation against the city. Further, the court rejected the city's argument that &sect; 66.189 was unconstitutional under the public purpose doctrine, which required public funds to be used for public purposes. The court found that the expenditures required by &sect; 66.189, were justified by public employee concerns over their need for full insurance coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and found that the insurer was entitled to contractual subrogation. The court also found that the disputed statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wisconsin's paternity statutes were comprehensively revised by ch. 352, 1979 Wis. Laws, effective July 1, 1981. Among the revisions, the legislature adopted Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.465(2), which provided that if a respondent was the alleged father and failed to appear at the first appearance scheduled blood test, pretrial hearing or trial, the court must enter an order adjudicating the respondent to be the father and appropriate orders for support, legal custody and physical placement. The trial court denied the State's motion for a default judgment brought pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.465(2), when the alleged father failed to personally appear at pretrial proceedings. The court held that even if the statute contemplated a mandatory default in all cases, the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.465(3), coupled with the surrounding circumstances rendered any error in denying the default harmless. The State challenged the trial court's decision to try the matter to a jury in view of the alleged father's failure to comply with the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.50(1). On appeal, the judgment dismissing the paternity petition was reversed and the matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's determination. Defendant asserted that appellants and respondents in appeals from municipal court to circuit court were persons similarly situated and thus constituted a single class of persons. He maintained that, by permitting appellants to request a jury trial on appeal, while denying that right to respondents, &sect; 800.14(4) created an irrational classification. The court found that under Wis.

The court held that the husband was given sufficient notice of the hearing on the wife's motion to re-open the divorce judgment and that his counsel was prepared to proceed, but that the lower court rescheduled the hearing. Thus, there was no showing that the husband was prejudiced. Further, the court held that the wife's motion was timely because the statute granting re-hearings ran from the date of entry of the judgment, not from the date of the trial. The court also held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in re-opening the judgment. In addition, the court rejected the husband's claim that &sect; 69.14(1)(f)1.b violated constitutional equal protection provisions by granting the custodial parent the right to give a child his or her surname. The court held that &sect; 69.14(1)(f)1.b did not state an unconstitutional preference for the mother because the father could obtain a custody determination prior to a child's birth.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the trial court properly considered the gravity of the offenses, the character of defendant, and the need to protect the public. Second, the court held that because the trial court did not consider the changes in parole in sentencing defendant, any changes did not warrant a modification of sentence. Third, the court held that while defendant that was represented by counsel had a right to view his presentence report, there was no affirmative duty on the trial court to timely deliver to defendant the report or for the trial counsel to share the report.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged her conviction for underage drinking, arguing that the city ordinance, City of La Crosse Ordinance 20.02(B), was unconstitutional. The trial court initially granted defendant's motion to dismiss on grounds that the ordinance violated her right to equal protection, but later reversed upon reconsideration. Defendant pled no contest to the charge and the circuit court affirmed the municipal court's judgment. The court found that the no contest plea did not constitute a waiver of defendant's challenge to the ordinance's facial validity. However, the court held that the ordinance was constitutional because it was rationally related to the government's objective of reducing alcohol related automobile accidents. The court rejected defendant's argument that adults under the age of 21 were a quasi-suspect class and that therefore the subject ordinance had to satisfy a heightened scrutiny standard of review. The court found that 18 to 20 year old persons prohibited from consuming alcoholic beverages were not a suspect group or one having a fundamental interest in engaging in the activity of drinking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff inmate appealed the orders of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed the inmate's action against defendants, prison officers and employees, that claimed violations of several federal and state statutes and sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief for alleged violations of due process rights and of state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate's complaint charged violations in connection with prison disciplinary proceedings. The claims raised under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 were dismissed because the inmate failed to exhaust his state administrative remedies before bringing the action. The complaint, recast as a petition for certiorari review, was dismissed because the hearings and decisions occurred more than six months prior to the date of the original complaint. On appeal, the inmate claimed that he was deprived of a remedy under the 14th Amendment where the postdeprivation remedies provided by the State were inadequate. The court affirmed because the state certiorari proceedings available to inmates for review of prison disciplinary proceedings were both suitable and meaningful where judicial review included determination of whether the committee followed its own rules governing the conduct of its hearings. Further, the trial court did not err when it dismissed the claims brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Finally, the inmate failed to avail himself of the exclusive remedy under Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.40(1) for judicial review of the validity of the rules nor did he allege that any single rule was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's orders.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that the organization was a &quot;nonprofit organization,&quot; as that term was used by Wis.

The court concluded that, so applied, &sect; 895.52 violated the equal-protection clauses of the United States and Wisconsin constitutions. There was no rational basis for the classification that was germane to the statute's &quot;articulated rationale.&quot; The legislature's purpose to protect property owners who did not derive more than a minimal pecuniary benefit&quot; from the recreational use of their property so as to open their land for recreational use was not advanced by carving out specific protection for the benefit of those landowners that are structured as &quot;nonprofit organizations.&quot; The interest that was advanced, namely, protecting those landowners structured as &quot;nonprofit organizations,&quot; even though they might derive significant &quot;pecuniary benefit&quot; from the property, had nothing to do with the statute's &quot;articulated rationale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, victim and parents, filed a medical malpractice action against defendants, hospital, emergency room doctor, and on-call doctor. The jury awarded damages against the emergency room doctor, but on motions after verdict, the Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin) dismissed the complaint as to all defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim suffered a head injury, was diagnosed by the emergency room doctor with a concussion, and was admitted by the on-call doctor to the hospital for observation. The victim then suffered an epidural hematoma resulting from intracranial bleeding and was transferred to another facility for emergency surgery, which was only partly successful. The trial court found that neither doctor was negligent in his care and treatment of the victim, but that the emergency room doctor was negligent in failing to inform the parents about alternative modes of treatment as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 448.30. The court held that the special verdict was defective because the evidence presented a question for the jury as to whether the doctors' failure to inform was a cause of the victim's injuries. The court also held that the doctors had a statutory duty to inform the parents that a CAT scan of the victim's brain could have been performed to rule out intracranial bleeding and that the hospital could not perform the requisite surgery if the victim suffered such bleeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the part of the judgment that dismissed plaintiffs' medical malpractice action as to the hospital and the part that determined plaintiffs' damages.

Defendant contended that his Miranda rights were violated when the police took his statements, that a sexual assault jury instruction was improper, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his wife were found in the desert. She was dead, and he was hospitalized because he had ingested a poisonous fluid. The police questioned him, thinking that he was a victim. He was eventually charged with and convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering his wife. On appeal, the court held that the police were not required to give defendant his Miranda warnings at the hospital because he was not under arrest or otherwise deprived of his freedom. The court concluded that his statements were voluntary because the questioning in the hospital was not custodial, and the police were not coercive. A jury instruction stating that great bodily harm caused by defendant during the course of conduct immediately preceding or following the act of nonconsensual intercourse was sufficient to find him guilty of first degree sexual assault was proper because, in interpreting the statute, the court determined that the sexual act itself did not have to have caused the great bodily harm. The court found that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he chose to testify, and his trial counsel did not advise him to testify to three different versions of his story.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered attorney's fees for the City as a cost of prosecution and a jail sentence if defendant did not pay the forfeiture judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was the chief executive officer of a church that owned the property where the vehicles were illegally stored. He claimed that the seizure of the vehicles was unreasonable and violated due process. The court rejected the claims because the seizure was not a necessary element of the offenses, and the forfeiture judgment imposed fines for abandonment, not for the costs of seizure and impoundment. In regard to defendant's claim that the trial court was not impartial, the court concluded that the trial court gave defendant his day in court with patience, courtesy, and restraint. In the court's view, it was not significant that defendant was not the property owner because the ordinance designated the offender as the person who abandoned the vehicles. The court held that the church did not qualify for exemptions in Sheboygan, Wis., Municipal Code, &sect; 38-231.1(a)-(c). Further, the trial court's imposition of an alternative jail sentence if defendant failed to pay the forfeiture judgment did not violate the state or federal constitutions. However, the award of attorney's fees was improper because they were not &quot;costs of prosecution&quot; under Sheboygan, Wis., Municipal Code &sect; 38.236.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the convictions and forfeiture judgment of the trial court, but reversed the award of actual attorney's fees to the City.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted, following a jury trial, of more than 15 counts of unlawful use of a telephone as a habitual criminal and of bail jumping as a habitual criminal. The allegations stemmed from numerous hang-up telephone calls made to the residences of several of the county district attorney's staff. On appeal, defendant admitted placing the telephone calls but argued that he lacked the intent to &quot;harass&quot; anyone at the called numbers and claimed that he was denied due process of law because he had been found guilty of violating an unconstitutionally vague statute. The court held that the word &quot;harass&quot; was not vague and that, as a matter of law, a person of ordinary intelligence would be able to determine that repeatedly calling a telephone number and hanging up in the early morning hours was conduct that Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.012(5) prohibited. The court stressed that the wording of the statute placed a person of ordinary intelligence on notice of such prohibited behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient appealed from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) a protective placement order and an order denying her petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The dispositive issue raised on appeal was whether the trial court lacked competency to proceed with a final hearing on respondent county's petition for protective placement after expiration of the 30-day limitation in Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(11)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two prior protective placement proceedings instituted against the patient were dismissed because the physicians failed to deliver their reports to the patient's counsel. After such dismissals, the physicians filed statements of emergency detention, which had the effect of continuing the patient's detention. There was no question that the patient was detained without a final hearing far in excess of the 14-day requirement Wis. Stat. &sect; 51.20(8)(bm) and the 30-day requirement of Wis. Stat. &sect; 55.06(11)(c). The county contended the court should disregard its failure to meet the statutory time limits because: (1) the physicians' delays were beyond the county's control; and (2) the patient needed to be in protective placement during all the time she was detained. The court found that even though no specific statutory language prohibited successive reinstatement of dismissed petitions, the constitution required that a line be drawn. Under the circumstances presented, the court concluded that the patient's continued temporary detention denied her due process of law. Therefore, the patient's motion to dismiss the third proceeding with prejudice should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The protective placement order and the order denying the patient's petition for a writ of habeas corpus were reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent father sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Clark County (Wisconsin), which awarded mother the legal custody of the parties' three minor children and further provided that respondent father was awarded reasonable visitation supervised by a proper person approved by county, yet the court could remove the restriction if father discontinued the imposition of his fundamentalist religious views on the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent father and petitioner mother's divorce decree awarded to her the legal custody of the parties' minor children, and father was awarded supervised visitation. The restriction on father's visitation could be removed if he would not impose his fundamentalist religious views on the children. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the restriction was valid. The court reasoned that the restriction was limited in scope and duration because father was allowed to discuss religion with the children so long as he did not cross into causing them to reject mother's religion. The restriction lasted until father stopped imposing his religious views on the children. The court found that limiting father's religious conduct was not the object of the restriction, but it was the incidental effect of securing mother's right under a valid law to choose the children's religion. The court concluded that the visitation restriction did not violate father's rights to the free exercise of his religion. Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.001(2m) gave mother, the custodial parent, the choice of religion for the children, and provided her with protection from subversion of her choice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court holding that the trial court had not unnecessarily abridged father's rights and freedom of religion by the visitation restriction. The custody statute had given mother the choice of religion for the children, and it provided mother with protection from subversion of her choice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case involved defendant's admitted burial of his baby in dirt outdoors. Experts stated that he was buried alive. Where defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.014, the trial court could use Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.014(1), which set the minimum amount of prison time before parole eligibility, or use Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.014(2) and judicially set a parole-eligibility date that was consistent with the case's circumstances. The court held that the heinousness of first-degree intentional homicide was a rational basis for making parole for those convicted of it different from that for those convicted of crimes that did not have a penalty of mandatory life imprisonment. The court also held that the circumstances of each case and each defendant supplied a rational basis for the two options given by &sect; 973.014; either repeated criminal behavior or a particularly gruesome crime was a rational basis for setting a parole-eligibility date without the benefit of the formula of &sect; 973.014(1). The court also ruled, inter alia, that the trial court did not make an error by refusing to submit a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of second-degree reckless homicide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) that convicted him of second-degree sexual assault of a child under Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(2). Defendant contested the finding of insufficiency under the rape shield law, Wis. Stat. 972.11(2)(b), as to his offer of proof pertaining to alternative semen source evidence, alleging violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim testified that defendant, the boyfriend of the cousin with whom the victim lived, raped the victim. About 12 hours after the rape, the victim was medically examined. Tests did not identify the source of the semen, but did find that the semen had been deposited within 72 hours. Under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 971.31(11), 972.11(2)(b), defendant sought to introduce evidence that the victim had intercourse with the victim's boyfriend through the cousin's testimony of what the victim had told the cousin. The victim testified during that she had not had intercourse with anyone the week before the rape. The court affirmed the judgment. What defendant offered to show questioned only the source of the semen, rather than the degree of the offense. Consequently, exclusion was proper under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.11(2)(b)2. Because defendant's proposed evidence addressed the victim's prior sexual encounters, it did not come within the &sect; 972.11(2)(b)2 exception for determining the offense's degree or the amount of harm suffered. The testimony of the cousin and the victim's boyfriend showed that the intercourse between the victim and the victim's boyfriend did not arise within 72 hours of the rape.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied both suppression requests. At the opening of the trial, the trial court suggested that an additional juror be impaneled because of the anticipated length of the trial. The parties agreed. Before the case was submitted to the jury the prosecutor and defense counsel mutually agreed to allow the 13-member jury to deliberate and render a verdict. After a colloquy by the judge that explained the agreement to defendant he agreed, understood, and desired to have the 13-member jury deliberate his guilt or innocence. Defendant was found guilty as charged and his postconviction motions were denied. On review, the court affirmed. The court stated that based on defendant's consent and the jury's understanding of the unanimity requirement there was no constitutional impediment to the use of a 13-member jury.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that the criminal defendant's claims lacked merit. The court reasoned that the reporter's position as a court officer gave her absolute immunity as to the conduct of her official duties and that the complaint only alleged misconduct in the reporter's discharge of her court duties, noting that only her official position allowed her to profit or to participate in preparing the transcripts and that none of the criminal defendant's allegations related to the reporter outside of her official role. The court also held that the extension of the doctrine of judicial immunity to court reporters in the discharge of their duties showed that the civil rights complaint did not state a claim on which relief could have been granted and determined that the general allegations of a conspiracy and of malicious intent fell far short of pleading events that supported an inference of a civil rights violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After she was allegedly stung by a bee in the retailer's outlet store, the customer filed the action against the retailer in small claims court. Following the denial of the customer's motions for a default judgment and contempt of court, the matter proceeded to trial. On appeal, the customer asserted Wis. Stat. &sect; 799.06(2), allowing a corporation to appear in a small claims action via an employee was an unconstitutional legislative invasion of judicial power. In a related assertion, she contended the trial court erred in denying her motion for default judgment and contempt of court. The customer also argued the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict and the trial court improperly awarded costs to the retailer. The court affirmed the judgment because the customer did not meet the proper burden of proof demonstrating &sect; 799.06(2) was unconstitutional, the trial court did not misuse its discretion in denying a default judgment and not finding the retailer in contempt of court, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict, and the award of costs to the retailer was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from judgments of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) that convicted him of two armed robberies, an attempted first-degree homicide as a party to a crime, attempted escape, assault by a prisoner, and battery by a prisoner as a party to a crime. The trial court also made orders that denied postconviction relief, from which orders defendant also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After he was adjudicated guilty regarding the robbery and attempted homicide charges, he was incarcerated pending sentencing, and he then attempted to escape. Defendant argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction regarding the escape-related charges as there was an alleged unreasonable delay between his arrest and his initial appearance on those charges. In favor of his delay argument, defendant cited Wis. Stat. &sect; 970.01, Wis. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, and the U.S. Const. amends. IV, XIV. The court disagreed. It was dispositive that defendant was in the State's lawful custody before, during, and after the attempted escape and that therefore he was not detained as a result of any arrest for the escape-related charges. The court held that without either prejudice or other unforeseen circumstances, the time between an &quot;arrest&quot; and an initial appearance was never unreasonable where the arrestee was already in the lawful physical custody of the State. The court also determined that defendant had not shown a new factor that justified a sentencing modification.</SPAN></P>

The request was supported with a verified petition and documents alleging continued harassment and domestic abuse. An extension was granted to last through June 8, 1991. Defendant did not challenge the extension. Defendant was charged with three violations of the extended injunction. He filed a motion to dismiss the charges, alleging that the extended injunction was invalid because Wis. Stat. &sect; 813.12(4) did not permit any injunction to exceed two years in length. The trial court denied the motion and found defendant guilty of the violation. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss, holding that &sect; 813.12(4) was unambiguous and that the total injunction period could not exceed two years, including extensions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant provided bankruptcy forms, advised persons how to fill out the forms, and charged $ 125 for his services. Defendant was charged with practicing law without a license. The trial court denied his motion to dismiss based on his contention that Wis. Stat. &sect; 757.30(2) was unconstitutional. A jury convicted defendant. As a condition of probation, defendant had to comply with the bankruptcy court's order to provide an accounting of his bankruptcy filings and fees. Defendant's motions for habeas corpus relief and to extend time to file his notice of intent to pursue post-conviction relief were denied, as was a subsequent motion to vacate his sentence. The court affirmed the judgment and held that a motion to vacate under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 could not have been used as a substitute for a direct appeal nor to have extended the time for appeals. He should have appealed directly from the judgment and sentence. Further, the probation conditions did not violate defendant's self-incrimination privilege because the Fifth Amendment did not protect a corporation or its custodian against self-incrimination through compulsory production of corporate records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior motion for postconviction relief, the inmate had unsuccessfully claimed ineffectiveness of counsel. In denying the inmate's motion for relief pursuant to Wis.

On review, the court held that the inmate had waived his claims that his convictions were inconsistent and constitutionally defective by failing to raise them before the trial court as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.31(2). The inmate failed to present to the trial court his claim that his mental health history should have been admitted at trial as required under Wis.

The inmate's claim that the denial of his request for a self-defense jury instruction was error was not cognizable within the context of a &sect; 974.06 motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal that the evidence was insufficient, that the information was duplicitous, that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the victim to testify to sex acts in addition to those charged, and that multiplicity in charging violated his right against double jeopardy. The court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that the evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to support each conviction and all modes of proof. The court concluded that because defendant had actual notice of the charges and his defense was not at all based upon the distinctions among various acts, he was able to adequately plead and prepare a defense. The court found that there was no support for defendant's claim of duplicity. The court determined that admission of all evidence of the attacks by defendant and his brother against the victim at the time and place of the crime was not improper or prejudicial and did not affect the unanimity of the verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied his motion for postconviction relief under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 brought 16 years after he was convicted as party-to-a-crime of first-degree murder and four counts of armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted. He filed an appeal and then 16 years later filed a motion for post conviction relief. The circuit court denied the motion and petitioner appealed. The court affirmed, in part. The court held that because petitioner received the statutory maximum sentence for each robbery conviction, the circuit court properly utilized the enhancer statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.641, to increase his sentence beyond the statutory maximum. The imposition of consecutive sentences was not a condition to the application of an enhancer statute. Petitioner's argument that the jury instruction on party-to-a-crime liability, Wis. Jury Instructions Crim. No. 400, improperly created a presumption of guilt was without merit because it simply provided that all parties to a crime were legally accountable. The court then found that petitioner had alleged sufficient facts that may have entitled him to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of ineffective assistance to trial counsel, but remanded for a determination as to whether the delay in bringing the motion was reasonable, as required by the doctrine of laches, and if so, whether the State had been prejudiced by the delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part, finding that the circuit court properly enhanced petitioner's sentence, that the party-to-a-crime instruction did not create a presumption of guilt, and that petitioner was barred from challenging an instruction. The court remanded for a determination of whether laches barred petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Winnebago County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of one count of misdemeanor theft, and four counts of different degrees of sexual assault, and from an order of the same court denying him postconviction relief. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by precluding him from producing evidence of the victim's experience with counseling for rape or sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sexually assaulted the victim, a wheelchair-bound woman, on a number of occasions. The trial court granted the State's pretrial motion in limine and excluded evidence that the victim previously made a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault by a neighbor, and that the victim had previously availed herself of counseling services for rape victims. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on charges of theft and multiple sexual assaults. The evidence of the victim's prior sexual experiences was clearly barred by the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.11(2)(b), and evidence that the victim had received rape counseling services was inadmissible because it inevitably would lead to testimony about previous sexual conduct, which also would violate &sect; 972.11(2)(b). The court found defendant's argument that the victim misleadingly tried to portray herself as a helpless victim who consented to the assault because she did not say &quot;no&quot; offensive and without basis in law.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 974.06. In sentencing defendant as an adult for burglary and escape, the trial court mentioned defendant's extensive juvenile record, and defendant argued on appeal that it was error to consider his juvenile record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A conviction procured with a violation of the right to counsel could not be used permissibly against a person either to substantiate guilt or to increase punishment for another offense. Defendant contended that his prior juvenile adjudications were imposed when he had no counsel. Where defendant was not represented by counsel at a juvenile proceeding, the adjudication could not be considered at a later adult-sentencing proceeding. The court decided that this rule did not apply to the case sub judice because per the court the trial court's explanation of the sentence for burglary did not reveal any reliance on defendant's juvenile record. The passing mention of a juvenile record did not violate the rule. The court found that the trial court stated that it considered five factors to make its sentencing determination, and the court found that each factor was an appropriate consideration. The court ruled that there was no abuse of discretion in the sentencing of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction for felony murder, kidnapping, and bail-jumping all stem from incidents surrounding defendant's ex-girlfriend and her sister who intervened and was killed in the process.

The court held that it was well established that a plea of guilty, knowingly and understandingly made, constituted a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects and defenses, including claimed violations of constitutional rights. The court noted that defendant voluntarily waived his defenses when he entered his guilty plea. Defendant understood the plea questionnaire and was fully informed by the trial court of all consequences of entering a guilty plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foundation purchased three lots in the subdivision where the property owners lived, and it began marking and building a historic scenic trail to run through the subdivision. An amendment to the declarations of restrictions on the lots in the subdivision was subsequently recorded. The amendment provided that no public trails were allowed to cross any properties in the subdivision. The property owners then filed a complaint alleging that by building the trail the foundation violated both town zoning restrictions and the subdivision restrictions. They requested a preliminary injunction and a declaratory judgment preventing the further construction of the trail. The trial court granted the foundation's motion for summary judgment, and the court affirmed. It held that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a Minnesota resident who worked in Wisconsin, contended that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.10(2), which permitted only Wisconsin residents to obtain an occupational license after suspension of their operator's license for OWI, violated the privileges and immunities clause of U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1 and the equal protection and due process clauses of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. On review, the court held that River Falls, Wis., Ordinance No. 7, adopting the Wisconsin OWI statutes, was constitutional. Operating a motor vehicle upon public highways was not a fundamental or inherent property right but was in the nature of a license or privilege and thus the denial of the right to apply for a Wisconsin occupational license to a nonresident person whose operating privileges were properly revoked did not violate the privileges and immunities clause or defendant's due process rights. Further, defendant's equal protection rights were not affected because there was a rational basis for creating different classifications between Wisconsin residents and nonresidents as to who might apply for an occupational license after suspension.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that his pleas were not knowing and intelligent. The court found that at the post-conviction motion hearing, defendant testified that he had always wanted to appeal the order denying his motion to dismiss, he did not discuss with his trial counsel the effect a no contest plea would have on the appealability of that order, and that he assumed he could appeal despite his no contest pleas. Notwithstanding defendant's testimony and the facts tending to corroborate his claim, the trial court simply did not believe him. The trial court inferred that defendant wanted to withdraw his plea because he was dissatisfied with the sentence. Defendant thought time served was appropriate for what he was accused of doing and questioned whether a four year sentence was justified.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Winnebago County (Wisconsin), which convicted defendant of conspiring to possess with intent to deliver more than 25 grams of cocaine, withheld sentence, and ordered defendant to serve a four-year term of probation with a six-month jail confinement and work release privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed the judgment and order of the trial court, arguing that the structure of the probation order was contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 161.41(1m)(c)3 and 973.09(1)(d). The court held that defendant violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.41(1x), thus subjecting her to the mandatory minimum penalties described in Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.41(1m)(c)3. Read together, Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.438 and Wis. Stat. 973.09(1)(d) exposed defendant to a presumptive minimum sentence of one year in prison and a $ 1000 fine. The trial court, however, had withheld defendant's sentence and ordered four years probation and only six months in the county jail with work release privileges, which was a term of confinement clearly less than the minimum one year. Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.09(1)(d) plainly required that when probation was deemed appropriate, the trial court also had to order confinement for at least that mandatory or presumptive minimum period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A fire occurred at a 12-unit apartment building where defendant lived. An accomplice, who was granted use immunity in return for testimony, implicated defendant as responsible for the fire. The accomplice first denied involvement in the fire and later changed his story and testified that on the day of the fire, defendant gave him the only key to the back door of the basement and instructed him to unlock the door. The accomplice further testified that defendant directed him to act as a lookout by watching the basement doors and that, shortly thereafter, he heard sounds similar to the pouring of a liquid and the striking of a match in the front area of the basement where defendant was standing. He also testified that defendant's motive for starting the fire was that defendant did not like a certain tenant. There was no physical evidence of the arson. The court held that the definition of intent under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.23(3) (1987) was neither vague nor a violation of defendant's due process rights. Additionally, the court found that testimony from a police officer about accomplice's interrogation was not an improper opinion as to the accomplice's truthfulness.</SPAN></P>

The state public defender appointed an attorney to represent Hall on appeal. The attorney filed a no merit report. A jury found defendant guilty of (1) lewd and lascivious behavior; (2) second-degree recklessly endangering safety; and (3) two counts of bail jumping. Defendant also pled no contest to: (1) disorderly conduct, and (2) possession of a switchblade knife. Defendant argued that the preliminary hearing for the charge of disorderly conduct was not conducted timely. The court held that the charge was a misdemeanor and defendant was not entitled to a preliminary hearing. Defendant argued that he should be allowed to withdraw his pleas because they were entered involuntarily and unknowingly. The court found the pleas were made voluntarily and knowingly. Defendant moved to dismiss the endangering safety charge because the State did not present any expert testimony that air rifle was capable of causing great bodily harm. The court found that this issue involved common knowledge and no expert testimony was required. The court concluded that there were no meritorious issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff counties appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which dismissed their complaint against State for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Their complaint sought payment of claims for reimbursement of court costs honored under former Wis. Stat. &sect; 814.25, which were left unpaid when the statute was repealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 3202(34)(c) provided that the treatment of Wis. Stat. &sect; 814.25 of the statutes first applied to certificates of repayments unpaid by the state treasurer on the effective date of the new statute. The court found that the language was unambiguous. The legislature intended to leave the counties' pending certificates of repayment unpaid when it repealed &sect; 814.25. Therefore, giving the statutory language its ordinary meaning, the court concluded that the counties' complaint failed to state a claim. The counties' entire claim against the State essentially rested on the argument that the legislature's action was unconstitutional. They maintained that it was a violation of due process of law for the legislature to retroactively extinguish their vested or valuable right by the repeal of the statute. However, a county did not have the legal right or status as against the State or another state agency to challenge the constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother appealed from an order that terminated her parental rights to her son pursuant to Wis. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48.415(2). The mother contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad on its face because it allowed for the termination of parental rights when a parent was unable, due to poverty, to meet the court-ordered conditions for the return of the child to the home. The court found that the statute clearly gave fair notice that failure to comply with the court-ordered conditions for the return of the child could place the mother's parental rights to the son in danger. Furthermore, the mother failed to show how she was inhibited from exercising her fundamental rights to raise her child. The mother also argued that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing a social worker to testify about the quality of the interaction between the mother and the son during the visitations. The court stated the quality of the interaction at the visitations would help to establish the substantial likelihood that the mother would ever be able to meet the conditions established for the return of the son.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 940.305. Defendant was also convicted of two counts of recklessly using a weapon, crimes that violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.20(1)(c), which was not the subject of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict on either hostage count, and that it was error to allow the State to use a tape recording as evidence. In affirming the conviction, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to prove all elements of the crime as to each hostage. When defendant entered the establishment, he stated that he wanted a certain individual. He announced two people were hostages. He ordered one hostage to get the individual he sought. It could have been reasonably inferred that defendant intended to hold his captives in order to influence the individual he sought to speak with or see him. That satisfied the intent element. The jury could have also concluded that defendant was demanding that the individual he sought appear and talk with him. Other conduct by defendant proved his guilt on the other hostage count. Further, Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.305 was not unconstitutionally vague. The legislature intended &sect; 940.305 to allow separate charges for each hostage taken in a single incident. Finally, the trial court properly allowed the state to use defendant's taped &quot;bloodbath&quot; remark because it was used solely to rebut defendant's testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant received life imprisonment with parole eligibility at 35 years. Defendant argued that the jury should have been charged with the lesser-included offense of first-degree reckless homicide for the first-degree intentional homicide charge.

The accomplice's discharge of the shotgun into the victim's chest at close range did not present reasonable grounds for acquittal of first-degree intentional homicide. The accomplice caused the victim's death with intent to kill him. It was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant's motion to charge the lesser-included offense of first-degree reckless homicide in submitting the issue of the accomplice's homicide. Further, the trial court addressed the primary factors when the sentences were issued and reached a reasonable conclusion based on the facts. Defendant also argued the unconstitutionality of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An elector and member of the school board was faced with a recall election. He filed a complaint challenging the recall election with the Election Board as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 5.06(1). But about two days before the board issued a ruling in favor of the school board, the elector filed an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief with the circuit court, or in the alternative for a writ of prohibition, on the grounds that the &sect; 5.06(1) was unconstitutional. The circuit agreed and enjoined the recall election. The board appealed and the court held that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. By Wis. Stat. &sect; 5.06(1), the board was the exclusive avenue of review and had to issue a final ruling as to all issues before the circuit court could hear the matter under Wis. Stat. &sect; 5.06(8). Even constitutional issues that the board did not have authority to rule on still had to be placed on the record before the board before it could be heard by the circuit court.

Finding that defendant had not objected to the sufficiency of the information by way of any pretrial motion or at trial, the court ruled that he had waived the alleged defect of the amended information. Regarding the trial court's in camera inspection of medical and psychological records of the victims and their mother by which the trial court found nothing material or helpful to the defense that had not been disclosed already, the court found no error and refused to hold that the trial court was required to permit defendant's expert to examine the records. Furthermore, the court held that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 971.23(5), 971.24(1) did not negate the privilege or privileges that covered the records sought. The court rejected defendant's other arguments, including one that evidence of a prior crime by him was improperly admitted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.04(2) at his trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which convicted her of operating an automobile while intoxicated, and from an order of the same court denying her motion for a new trial. Defendant claimed that the trial court deprived her of (1) a statutory right to use an accident report to impeach a state's witness, and (2) her constitutional right to confront and cross-examine a witness against her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant identified herself to a police officer as the driver of a car that had struck a house. The officer noted that defendant's breath smelled of intoxicants and that she had an unsteady gait, slurred speech and glassy, bloodshot eyes. He arrested her for operating while intoxicated, and a blood test confirmed that her blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit. The officer prepared several reports of the accident, including a narrative of the accident, and a uniform traffic accident report (&quot;accident report&quot;) pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.70(4). The latter contained a small sketch of the accident scene. The court held that the trial court correctly refused to allow defendant to introduce the accident report for use to impeach the officer.  Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.73(2) prohibited use of such accident reports in any criminal trial arising out of the accident and took precedence over Wis. Stat. &sect; 906.13(2) which generally allowed the use of prior inconsistent statements to impeach. As so applied, Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.73(2) did not deprive defendant of her unconstitutional right of confrontation because it did not necessarily contradict the officer and was not critical to her defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance required that booths used for viewing adult-oriented videos be open to public view.

The business asserted that the ordinance violated its First Amendment rights and that it was preempted by the federal Videotape Privacy Protection Act. The court affirmed holding that (1) the language of the Act did not contain an unequivocal expression by Congress of its intent to preempt local regulation of the physical layout of adult-oriented establishment; (2) the ordinance, a health and safety enactment aimed at curtailing sexual activity in enclosed viewing booths, was not in conflict with the Acts purpose of prohibiting the disclosure of videotape rental or sales records; (3) patrons of the business did not have any constitutionally protected right to private and anonymous viewing of sexually explicit materials in a public accommodation setting; and (4) the ordinance satisfied the requirements for valid time, place, and manner restrictions on the First Amendment rights of the patrons of the business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him on a jury verdict of first-degree intentional homicide, party to a crime, Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two sons of the victim connected the killer's raincoat to a raincoat found in a car in which defendant was a passenger. Further, two witnesses testified that defendant was a principal in the crime, and that he fired the shot that killed the victim. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Further, the trial court's finding that defendant's Miranda rights were properly presented to him prior to his statement was not against the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence. The court rejected defendant's argument that reversal was mandated by the trial court's response to the jury without counsels' presence. The court noted that defendant did not claim that the trial court's answer was incorrect. The trial court's error was subject to the harmless error rule, and there was no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the conviction. The court held that defendant was afforded his due process sentencing rights. In the court's view, the trial court's setting of defendant's parole eligibility was a part of its sentencing function, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.014 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which denied his Wis. Stat. 974.06 post-conviction motion. A jury convicted defendant of one count of arson and four counts of endangering safety by conduct regardless of life, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.02(1)(a) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.30 (1986). He was sentenced to consecutive prison sentences of 15 years for the arson and 5 years for each of the other counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that Wis. Stat. &sect; 941.30 (1986) was unconstitutional, that the State failed to prove every element of &sect; 941.30 (1990), that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that he was improperly sentenced. The court opined that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin had previously held that &sect; 941.30 (1986), and particularly the phrase &quot;evincing a depraved mind,&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, the 1990 amendment to &sect; 941.30 had no effect on the State's burden or the validity of defendant's conviction. Thus, defense counsel was not deficient for not raising the constitutionality of &sect; 941.30. Counsel was not deficient for failing to introduce a gas company's report because it did not exculpate defendant. Counsel was not deficient in failing to introduce the testimony of the building's owner because he testified on voir dire that he would plead the Fifth Amendment. The court opined that it was precluded from reviewing data in defendant's appendix because it was not part of the record. Finally, defendant's claim that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing was not properly raised on a Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 motion, and he did not raise a &quot;new factor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court also held that while the trial court instructed the jury based on the language of the version of Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.20(2) not yet in effect when the offenses were committed, the error did not affect defendant's substantial rights because in lieu of the phrase &quot;sex organ&quot; the trial court used &quot;genitals or pubic area,&quot; and this was hardly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the time period in question, the father and his ex-wife, stipulated to shared custody of their two children. The father was to have the children overnight for six of every fourteen nights, or 156 nights per year. They would otherwise live with the mother, who assumed all clothing, school and recreational costs. The court affirmed and held that the trial court properly used Wis. Admin. Code &sect; HSS 80.04(2) to establish the father's support obligation. The court held further that a child support award computed under Wis. Admin. Code ch. HSS 80 is presumed fair. The father could not meritoriously argue that the trial court abused its discretion by applying a presumptively fair method that the court expressly authorized on remand from the father's prior appeal. The trial court properly applied Wis. Admin. Code &sect;. HSS 80.04(2) retroactively. The general rule that legislation is to be applied prospectively unless otherwise provided did not prevent the trial court from exercising its discretion to apply the formula contained in &sect; HSS 80.04(2) to reach a fair result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, administrator of deceased patient's estate, appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which dismissed his malpractice claim against defendants, hospital, physicians, and their insurers, as outside the three-year statute of limitations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.55(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was admitted to the hospital and died shortly thereafter. The administrator filed a request for mediation as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.44. Separate attorneys filed notices of retainer for each of defendants. The mediation was unsuccessful. Allegedly, the hospital's counsel requested continued negotiations and agreed to waive the statute of limitations if no settlement were reached. No agreement was reached and the administrator filed suit. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The circuit court awarded summary judgment to all defendants. The administrator appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The circuit court erroneously concluded that because there was no writing as a matter of law under Wis. Stat. &sect; 807.05 there was no agreement because &sect; 807.05 only applied to agreements reached during an action or special proceeding. Because a factual dispute existed over whether or not the hospital had agreed to waive the limitations period, summary judgment for the hospital was inappropriate. However, because all of the other defendants had different counsel and were not parties to any such agreement, they were entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 752.31(2)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landlord filed a complaint alleging that the former tenant owed him $ 1,227 on an oral lease. The complaint was served at the former tenant's last known address. The landlord was granted a default judgment. Later the former tenant sought to have the case reopen past the statutory six-month limitation on reopening such judgments found in Wis. Stat. &sect; 752.31(2)(a). The former tenant challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The lower court granted the motion to reopen ruling that it was not anyone's fault that the wrong address was used and that the court did not favor default judgments. The lower court ultimately dismissed the landlord's claim and the former tenant's counterclaim for rent paid. The court reversed holding that the six-month time limitation was not unreasonable because compliance was not impossible and, in view of the relatively low stakes and quick process of small claims proceedings, six months was a reasonable time to reopen a default judgment. The legislature had the right to resolve this conflict in policies and to impose conditions on an individual's right to recovery. The former tenant was not deprived of due process.</SPAN></P>

His &sect; 1983 claim stated a claim for violation of procedural due process. His failure to allege compliance with Wis.

The court held that the probation order was unrelated to defendant's offense of misdemeanor theft. There was no evidence in the record that any man was involved. The order placed no limit on the discretion of defendant's probation officer and did not set any standards for him to apply in determining whether he should allow defendant to cohabit with a particular man. That portion of the order placed an unconstitutional burden on defendant's freedom of association and right to privacy.

In affirming the trial court's and the Board's judgment, the court held that the preponderance of the evidence standard was appropriate because although the loss of a license to practice medicine was a substantial loss, the state had a strong interest and an obligation to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.

Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(d), which made it a crime to have sexual contact or sexual intercourse with a person that one knew was unconscious, was void for vagueness if the definition of unconscious included a lack of awareness resulting from sleep. Part of this argument depended on the premise that there were no guidelines regarding what stage or level of sleep produced a sufficient lack of awareness to make it equivalent to being unconscious. The court rejected this on the basis that, inter alia, the jury had to decide whether or not the victim was at a level of sleep that produced a sufficient lack of awareness and had to decide whether defendant knew of that lack of awareness or not. Regarding evidentiary rulings of the trial court, the court rejected defendant's arguments, including one that posited that it was an error to exclude proffered expert testimony. The court ruled that the expert testimony was irrelevant because the proposed subject was general research information about sleep that did not inform as to a particular person's sleep patterns on a particular night.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fishers were holders of Wis. Admin. Code ch. NR 25 trawling permits, which authorized them to take set amounts of specified fish in certain waters. The actual fish quotas were set forth in various administrative rules in ch. NR 25. After the Board adopted rules repealing, recreating, and amending ch. NR 25, including those setting the forage fish quotas, the fishers filed an action challenging the validity of the new rules and seeking a temporary restraining order. The trial court granted respondents' summary judgment motion. The court held that the fishers were not entitled to an adjudicatory hearing because their permits were not revoked or suspended. Rather, the permits were subject to the provisions of ch. NR 25. Although the fishers held the only trawling permits in Lake Michigan, the DNR's new rules were not impermissibly directed to a &sect; 227.01(13) closed class because they applied to all commercial fisherman holding forage fish trawling permits. Further, the rule revision did not constitute a &quot;taking&quot; because the fishers' permits created no vested or permanent rights. Finally, the DNR's actions did not violate Wis. Stat. &sect; 101.11 because it was not the fishers' employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that officials denied him due process by placing his daughter on the &quot;visitation denied&quot; list, thereby refusing him visitation. He also argued that a social worker in his daughter's &quot;CHIPS&quot; case illegally and unconstitutionally gave prison officials the confidential terms of the CHIPS order denying him visitation. As to the first argument, the instant court found that the juvenile court that denied the inmate visitation in the CHIPS proceedings had already furnished the inmate any process he was due; the order superseded the prison's general policies regarding visitation provided by the corrections department's administrative rules that the inmate maintained created and gave him constitutionally protected liberty interests in visitation. As to the second argument, the social worker had the power to share court orders pertaining to prison inmates with other persons working for the prison system. While exercising her power under a statute, the social worker was often required to make discriminating judgments. Here, she had a legitimate concern that the inmate's parents might attempt to bring his daughter to the prison, in violation of the CHIPS order.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the trial court erroneously concluded that the special prosecutor did not have the same power that an elected district attorney had in deciding whether or not the public interest required the dismissal of the criminal charges. The court also held that the trial court abused its discretion by deciding that the case needed to proceed so long as there was admissible evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In March 1989, defendant was charged with driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, and driving a motor vehicle while having a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.1 percent or more. The trial was originally set for January 1990, but was adjourned six times until May 1991. At that time, the State requested an adjournment because its witness, a police officer, was on vacation. The trial court denied the request. Only one charge was before the trial court because the other had been dismissed. The trial court ordered the State to proceed, but the State had no witnesses to present. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss based on no evidence. The charges were reissued against defendant and he moved to dismiss on grounds that further prosecution was barred by the double-jeopardy provisions of the federal and state constitutions. Because the earlier proceeding had been a bench trial and no witnesses had been sworn, double jeopardy had not attached under Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.07. The trial court's attempt to effectuate a dismissal with prejudice before the attachment of jeopardy was ineffective and did not bar reissuance of the charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties disagreed as to the correct method of tax assessment for a federally subsidized low-income housing project. The partnership asserted that a capitalization of income method based upon actual income and expenses was correct while the Board supported use of a capitalization of income based upon estimated market rents. Specifically, the partnership challenged the use of market rents as opposed to contract rents in the calculation of assessed value using the income capitalization approach. In affirming the Board's decision, the court rejected the partnership's argument that the Board's assessment was arbitrary because it was based on the directions found in the Assessment Manual created by the Department of Revenue. The Board's affirmation of the assessor's use of market rents to establish the full value for tax purposes of this subsidized housing project was made on the &quot;best information available&quot; and thus the constitutional requirement of uniformity was met. Assessors in Wisconsin had to employ the procedures of evaluation described in the Assessment Manual, and there was no conflict between the assessment methods described in the Manual and Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury found defendant guilty of criminal damage to 12 police cars under Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.01(1). On appeal, the conviction was affirmed. The court held that defendant failed to show that his trial counsel was guilty of deficient performance by waiting until the day of trial to orally move for disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant. The informant's identity was privileged from discovery under Wis. Stat. &sect; 905.10(1). The court ruled that evidence of defendant's &quot;other bad acts&quot; were properly admitted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.04(2). The evidence was admitted to show plan, knowledge, and motive. The court determined that defendant did not show a need for the disclosure, and the trial court's reliance on cross-examination was a reasonable, discretionary decision to preserve defendant's rights. Finally, the court ruled that defendant did not indicate how the testimony of adverse witnesses failed to prove guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or what elements of the crime lacked proof. Nor did he show he was unable to confront the witnesses. Thus, defendant's claims of insufficient evidence and that his right to confront adverse witnesses was violated were rejected.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the minor had missed 26 days of school and determined that each day was a separate violation of its previous disposition order and thus, 26 days of detention was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor was adjudicated delinquent. The minor was placed on supervision and was specifically told by the trial court that he must attend school each and every day. The state filed a motion for sanctions after the minor missed a number of days of school. The trial court found that the minor had missed 26 days of school and sent him to a detention facility for 26 days. The court affirmed the trial court's orders. The court held that the minor was adjudged delinquent under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.12 and was not adjudged a child alleged to be in need of protection and services (CHIPS) under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.13(6). Thus, the CHIPS' statutes regarding the proper determination of the reasons for the minor's absences from school did not apply to the trial court's hearing on the alleged violations by the minor. Indeed, due to the clear language in the two statutes and the legislative distinction between CHIPS and delinquents, it would inappropriate for the court to extend Wis. Stat. &sect; 118.16(5)'s hearing requirements to situations other than CHIPS. The court also held that the notice to the minor of all the alleged violations in one notice was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's rulings that the minor should be detained at a juvenile facility for 26 days for violating a delinquency court order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Rusk County (Wisconsin) that granted a declaratory judgment in favor of respondent taxpayer. The circuit court held that, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 70.32, the mineral interests were taxed separately from surface interests in land, and that a tax deed did not extinguish the taxpayer's interest in the mineral rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer owned mineral rights in land; the surface interest in the land was owned by a third party. After the third party failed to pay real estate taxes for five years, the county obtained a deed to the property. The third party paid taxes for one of the years and redeemed the deed, however, the remaining overdue taxes subjected the property to the possibility of seizure by the county in the future. The taxpayer initiated the action for injunctive and declaratory relief and the circuit court granted the declaratory judgment in its favor. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, holding that &sect; 70.32, which established a unitary tax scheme, classified mineral interests in such a manner that they were subject to separate taxation from the land. The court found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 706.057(2)(d) protected mineral interest owners who agreed to pay taxes under a contract with the surface interest owner and did not conflict with &sect; 70.32. The court then concluded that the tax deed held by the county extinguished the taxpayer's right to the mineral interests and that the statutory scheme did not constitute a violation of procedural or substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant school district sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Richland County (Wisconsin), which entered judgment affirming an order by respondent Department of Industry, Labor, and Human Relations in favor of respondent employee after the district refused to substitute accumulated reimbursable leave for unpaid leave under the state Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The employee sought review of the denial of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon learning that his family was to receive an adopted son, the employee requested a five-day leave under the FMLA, and was denied a request to substitute five days of accumulated paid sick leave for the unpaid leave provided for in the FMLA. The employee took the leave but complained to the Department, which then ordered the district to reimburse the employee for the five days. Prior to the trial court's entry of judgment in his favor, the employee also sought attorney's fees for the costs of the trial, which the trial court denied. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the Department's order but reversed the trial court's order denying attorney's fees in the trial court. The court first rejected the district's arguments that substitution of paid leave for unpaid leave was improper as against administrative rules or public policy and found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 103.10(5) unambiguously permitted such substitution and did not conflict with either administrative rules or a collective bargaining agreement. The court next determined that the employee's request for attorney's fees was timely and that such award was consistent with the fee-shifting provisions of the FMLA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the Department's order that the district reimburse the employee for five-day leave and that awarded attorney's fees and costs. The court reversed the trial court's order denying attorney's fees in the trial court and remanded the cause with directions to determine attorney fees on appeal as well as on review in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The husband appealed, contending that a deviation from the percentage standard was appropriate because of substantial periods of physical placement to both parties, the relative circumstances of each party, and his long work weeks. The court affirmed, holding that the husband did not meet his burden of proving that application of the standard was unfair because they were presumptively used pursuant to statute, he was given credit for his custodial periods, and the trial court conducted the proper balancing of the child's needs and the advantages the child would have received from the husband's extra work if the marriage had continued. The court also found no abuse of discretion in the trial court balancing the length of the husband's work week against the needs of the child to arrive at his support obligation. The wife's motion to declare the appeal frivolous was denied, even though the husband's claim that the percentage standards were unconstitutional was without merit, because the appeal was not brought to harass and was not frivolous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This controversy arose over charges that the nurse engaged in misconduct, contrary to Wis. Adm.

Code &sect;&sect; 132.31(6)(c) 50.09(6)(b), which required him to report allegations of nursing misconduct. Meanwhile, the nurse resigned her position with the county and took a position with another employer. Thereafter, the Board concluded that the nurse's attempts, by verbal and physical encouragement to persuade a patient to open his mouth after he declined to do so, constituted a violation of Wis. Adm. Code &sect;7.04(4). This complaint resulted in the Board's reprimand of the nurse's new employer. Furthermore, the nurse was reassigned to a new position. On appeal, the court held that summary judgment was proper because the supervisor and the county were immune from suit on the nurse's misrepresentation and intentional interference clam. Furthermore, the court held that the nurse's &sect; 1983 claim failed because the nurse was not deprived of due process.</SPAN></P>

In the new precedent case, the carrier's reducing clause was enforceable against the insured and issued relief from the initial mandate after decision of another case that was considered on the same point The court found that the issues in the later-decided cases were not the same as the issues in the case from which the accident victims sought relief.
