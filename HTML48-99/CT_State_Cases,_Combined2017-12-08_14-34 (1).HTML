Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-289, as amended by 1961 Conn. Pub. Acts 335.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The association's original appeal from the Board's decision was dismissed because the association had erroneously served the state attorney general instead of the board. The association refiled the appeal under the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-592 and 52-593, which permitted refiling a civil action within one year if it was dismissed otherwise than on the merits. The trial court sustained the Board's plea in abatement to the second appeal. On review, the Board argued that the only statutory procedure for an administrative appeal was under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-289, as amended by 1961 Conn. Pub. Act 335. The court agreed and affirmed the judgment. The court found that the Board was a state-created administrative agency and that if the legislature wished to alter the procedural steps to perfect an administrative appeal it could have provided for them in &sect; 20-289. The court noted that in an earlier ruling it had held that an administrative appeal was not an &quot;action&quot; subject to the refiling provisions for civil cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A minor was arrested and charged with illegal possession of narcotics. The minor agreed to assist the police in apprehending the person who had been his source of narcotics.

The minor testified that he placed his order over the telephone with defendant and shortly thereafter met defendant and his codefendant for the purchase. Police officers kept the minor under surveillance during the entire proceedings, and their testimony at the trial served to corroborate that of the minor. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. There was adequate corroborative evidence to support the inference that drugs found near where the sale took place had a common origin with the drugs sold to the minor and were connected to the crime charged. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial. There was no indication that the minor was influenced by promises into testifying against defendant and his codefendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court in the Sixth Circuit, Appellate Division (Connecticut), that affirmed his conviction of keeping alcoholic liquor with the intent to sell in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-77, arguing that evidence obtained by a police officer in a search of defendant's automobile was improperly admitted where the officer had neither a search warrant nor a warrant for defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police officer observed defendant standing next to his car and talking with two people. At the conclusion of their conversation, defendant opened the truck of his car and removed two bottles of alcohol therefrom. As the officer approached, defendant replaced the bottles in the trunk and closed it. The officer asked defendant to open the trunk. Defendant complied, and the officer observed a dozen pints of wine and more than three dozen half-pints of whiskey. The officer arrested defendant, who was charged with keeping alcoholic liquor with the intent to sell in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-77. Following his conviction and its affirmation on appeal, defendant sought further review. In finding error, the court concluded that the trial court erred in admitting the fruits of the search into evidence and that such error was prejudicial. That defendant complied with the officer's command that he open his trunk did not amount to consent, and the officer had no probable cause to believe that defendant was engaged in an illegal act. As such, no probable cause to execute the search existed, and the evidence was inadmissible against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because there was error, the judgment was set aside, and a new trial was ordered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both plaintiff, a used car dealer, and defendant motor vehicles commissioner appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in Hartford County (Connecticut) in the used car dealer's declaratory judgment action. The trial court determined that a portion of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-1 (47) defining the phase &quot;ultimate consumer&quot; stifled competition in the automobile business by favoring new car dealers and was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The used car dealer sought an injunction prohibiting the commissioner from refusing to register used vehicles. The case was tried on a stipulation of facts, and the trial court rendered a judgment that was limited exclusively to a decree that the portion of &sect; 14-1 (47) which defines the phrase &quot;ultimate consumer&quot; in the statute is invalid, null and void. All parties to the action appealed from the limited judgment as rendered. Among the assignments of error, one was directed at the failure of the trial court to determine the issues raised by the pleadings. On review, the court found that the judgment neither granted nor denied a requested injunction, and the issues were not found, nor was judgment rendered, for either party. The judgment did not even purport to answer the specific questions for the determination of which the suit was instituted. The court held that the judgment, as rendered, was clearly inadequate because any judgment, to be adequate, must conform to the pleadings, the issues and the prayers for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found error in the trial court's judgment and set it aside. The court ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Fairfield County (Connecticut). An information charged him in the first part with breaking and entering, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-76, and in the second part as a second offender. He pleaded not guilty to the first part but he was found guilty as charged in a bench trial. He pleaded guilty to the second part. A judgment of guilty under both parts was entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant essentially urged that the evidence was inadequate to support the adjudication of guilt. He was charged with breaking into a gas station. A gas station employee testified that on the night in question he locked all the doors and closed the window of the men's room. A police officer testified that during the night in question, he had seen two men, one of whom he recognized as defendant, coming from the front of the station carrying a large heavy object. The officer apprehended defendant and his companion and found the front door unlocked and ajar. Also the men's room window was open. The floor safe was found outside in the driveway. The court found no error in defendant's conviction and sentence, as the evidence warranted the adjudication of guilt of breaking and entering with intent to steal. Defendant and his companion were alone at the station during the time in question. The court concluded that the fact that no one saw defendant actually breaking into or out of the building, or even inside it, did not preclude a conviction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-76, as the circumstantial evidence was strong enough to prove guilt of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner applied to the zoning commission to change the classification of his property to allow development of 25 lots for single-family residences. The commission denied the application and the trial court dismissed the owner's appeal from that decision. The court found no error in the trial court's judgment. The commission's decision was supported by evidence showed that the factors of water supply and sewage disposal in the owner's development plan presented a definite public health question, and the commission's decision not to change the classification was not arbitrary, confiscatory, or an abuse of discretion. The court also rejected the owner's claim that the zoning classification of his property was unconstitutional because it had no relationship to health, safety, morals or the general welfare and was a taking of property without just compensation and without due process of law. The basis for the commission's denial of the application showed that the classification had a relationship to public health concerns, and the owner made no showing that the classification deprived him of the ability to put the property to any use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of the crime of robbery with violence. He was represented by a special public defender who, after trial, requested an extension of time to perfect the inmate's appeal. The special public defender notified the inmate that any grounds of appeal would be frivolous and took no other action. The inmate filed a motion for the appointment of counsel which was denied and the inmate's appeal was dismissed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in habeas corpus. The court found that appointment of counsel was required to ensure the inmate's right to assistance of counsel on appeal was not violated. The court also found that the trial court did not exceed its power in conditioning the inmate's release on the appointment of appellate counsel and that the trial court had the power in a habeas corpus proceeding to dispose of the matter as law and justice required pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2243. The court also determined that while the trial court did not ordinarily have the authority to allow a late appeal, such authority was proper where on habeas corpus it had been properly determined that a right of appeal required by the federal constitution had been denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former mayor of the city and the superintendent of public welfare were voted pensions by the board of trustees under 25 Conn.

The board could likewise retire any employee who had been continuously in the service of the city for 20 years prior to reaching the age of 65, but such employees were to be paid a proportionate pension. Both the mayor and superintendent applied for pensions. Neither asked to be retired, and neither had reached the age of 65. Each applicant sought the pension under the second half of the statute. Plaintiffs filed suit to enjoin payment of the pensions and contended that the board acted illegally. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the board. Plaintiffs appealed, and the court found error, set aside the judgment, and remanded. The court held that the second part of the statute did not confer upon any 20-year employee who had not reached the age of 65 the right to voluntary retirement, as claimed by the mayor and superintendent.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the Governor's veto was unconstitutional because (1) Conn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15 did not authorize the Governor to veto general legislation contained in appropriations bills, and (2) including such general legislation contrary to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2-35 merely repealed that statute by implication rather than making the general legislation illegal. The court found that two of the three vetoed provisions were consistent with legislative authority under Conn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23 to assign duties to the Comptroller. However, the court held that the third provision was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt because it infringed on the Comptroller's authority under &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

Defendant repeatedly attacked a woman and her daughter. Defendant killed the woman, but the daughter survived. Defendant fled, but was eventually caught in Georgia. Detectives from Connecticut went to Georgia and discussed the case with defendant. While in Georgia, the detectives examined defendant's vehicle without a search warrant. Certain objects taken from the car were submitted to the state laboratory in Connecticut for examination. No search warrant was obtained. The daughter's blood and hair were found in defendant's car and introduced at trial over objection. The court held that the blood and hair were inadmissible because they were the result of an illegal search and seizure. No consent was given for the search. The search was not incident to a lawful arrest because the search occurred two days after the arrest and occurred in a different town from where defendant was being held. The error could not be regarded as harmless because it was impossible to say that admission of the evidence did not contribute to the verdict, especially since it was used to bolster the daughter's testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action was tried in conjunction with the applicant's appeal of the zoning commission's decision to deny his permit application. In that appeal, the applicant argued that the town did not comply with statutory procedural requirements in passing a new zoning ordinance. The trial court sustained that appeal but found in favor of defendants in the applicant's action for declaratory relief and an injunction, finding that the invalid ordinance had been cured by its readoption. The applicant's subsequent applications were denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the ordinance in effect at the time the applicant brought the action did not apply. In actions for injunctions and declaratory relief, where the relief was prospective, the law to be applied was the law that had developed at the time of trial. The court found that even the filing of an application for a permit did not restrict the right of a zoning commission to amend an ordinance by changing the grounds for approval of the permit. The court stated that the town's notice of the change in the zoning ordinance, upon its readoption, was sufficient to comply with the procedural requirements of Conn. Gen.

The trial court's judgments were affirmed on appeal. The court found that the commission's denial of the application for a change of zone was reasonable because the granting of the request would not conform to the comprehensive plan. The court also found that the claim of unconstitutionality was without merit because, contrary to the company's contention, the company's land had not been confiscated and rendered unsalable.

The daughter was pregnant at the time.

On appeal the court held that while the record was unclear, the taxpayers were found to have failed to show that they would suffer an irreparable injury, necessary for an injunction to issue, and that the constitutionality of the statute was incidental to the injunctive action. The court held that the taxpayers' complaint merely alleged that they were aggrieved by the granting of the permit, which was not the equivalent of an irreparable injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The zoning commission amended the zoning regulations of Fairfield, Connecticut, by creating a flood plain district. The zoning of the landowners' property was thus changed from residence B zone to flood plain district. The landowners contended that the application of the new regulations to their property constituted the taking of property without compensation and without due process of law in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and in violation of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The trial court dismissed the landowners' appeals from the zoning commission's decision. In reversing on appeal, the court held that: (1) the uses permitted under Fairfield, Conn., Zoning Regulations &sect; 22.2 (1960) placed such limitations on the use of the landowners' property that the enforcement of the regulation amounted to a practical confiscation of the property, for all practical purposes rendering the landowners' use of the property impossible and reducing its value by at least 75 percent; and (2) because the change in zoning, insofar as it affected the landowners' property, was unreasonable and confiscatory, it violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside the judgment from the trial court, which dismissed the landowners' appeals from the action of the zoning commission changing the classification of their properties to flood plain district. The court remanded the case to the trial court, holding that the regulations pertaining to the flood plain district could have no application to the landowners' property and directing the trial court to sustain their appeals.</SPAN></P>

The applicants brought an action seeking a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to their land. The trial court ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutional and issued an injunction restraining the enforcement of the ordinance against the applicants. On appeal, the court found no error. The town's zoning regulations limited the use of the applicants' land to residence purposes only. There was no land available to enable the applicants to satisfy the requirements for a town street. The application of the ordinance to the applicants' land was harsh in comparison with the trivial public benefit, if any, that might result from its enforcement. The ordinance was confiscatory as it prevented the effective use of the applicant's land for any purpose allowed by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff owner appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County (Connecticut), which dismissed her appeal from a decision of defendant zoning board granting a variance to defendant developer to build a dwelling on a lot that had less frontage than required by zoning regulations for a building lot in the district in which the lot was located.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer purchased a lot relying on assurances from the planning and zoning office and the building inspector that a building permit could be issued and a dwelling could be built on the lot. These assurances were based on the then-most-recent opinion of the town counsel. The building inspector subsequently ordered construction stopped based on a more recent opinion of town counsel that did not allow construction of a dwelling on the property. The zoning board granted a variance. The owner, who owned an adjacent lot, appealed from a trial court judgment that upheld the board's decision. The court held that the trial court was not in error in concluding that the owner failed to prove that the action of the board was illegal, arbitrary, or in abuse of its discretion. The developer could not obtain additional frontage to meet the zoning requirement and application of the regulations to its property practically destroyed the property's value. When considered in the light of the fact that it was possible to build on smaller lots if they were mapped of record prior to 1945, the zoning requirement were in effect confiscatory or arbitrary as applied to the developer's lot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city zoning enforcement officer appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Fairfield County (Connecticut) that ordered him to issue the permit for which plaintiff development corporations had applied. The permit applied for was to excavate and remove earth to create a lake on the excavation site. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6 applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The zoning officer contended on appeal that the failure of the corporations to exhaust the administrative remedy provided by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6 deprived them of the right to a judicial action. The court found that the corporations were in effect seeking a review of the officer's action. Per Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6(1), the city zoning board of appeals was vested with the power to hear and decide appeals where it was alleged that there was an error in any order, requirement, or decision made by the official charged with the enforcement of the zoning laws or any regulations adopted pursuant to them. An appeal could then be taken under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8 from the decision of the board to the Court of Common Pleas. When a party had a statutory right of appeal from the decision of an administrative officer or agency, he could not instead of appealing bring an independent action to test the very issue that the right of appeal had been given to test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court wrote that there was error, and, acting against the development corporations, it set aside the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with a direction to render judgment for the city zoning enforcement officer on all counts of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a retail car dealership, appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court (Connecticut), which affirmed the judgment of the circuit court that entered judgment in favor of defendant buyer in the dealerships' action to recover a deficiency alleged to be due on the purchase price of an automobile sold under a retail installment contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The buyer purchased the car under a retail installment contract that was assigned to a sales finance company. When the buyer defaulted in the installment payments, the finance company repossessed the car. The finance company chose to resell the car under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-98(e) and sent the buyer by certified mail a written notice about the sale as required by &sect; 42-98(d), but the buyer never received the notice. In the dealership's action for a deficiency judgment, the buyer argued that because he received no actual notice of the sale, he was not liable for any deficiency judgment. On appeal the court found that the disjunctive phrase &quot;or by&quot; in &sect; 42-98(d) meant that there were two separate methods of giving the buyer notice of the proposed sale, which were by personal notice or by certified mail. The statute did not require actual notice, and to impose such a requirement would have allowed the buyer to thwart a valid sale. The finance company complied with the &sect; 42-98(d), and the trial court and the lower appellate court erred to find to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the buyer and directed that the judgment should be entered in favor of the dealership.</SPAN></P>

The optometrist petitioned for the restoration of his license, but the superior court sustained the order of the board. Upon review, the court found error, set aside the judgment, and remanded the case with directions to grant the optometrist's petition. The court held that chapter 380 of the Conn. Gen. Stat. could not be construed to prohibit an employment relationship between a corporation or any other unlicensed person, under any circumstances, and a licensed optometrist for a fixed salary, and that the board lacked the power and competence under the legislation to decide otherwise, as the power to prohibit such a relationship rested with the legislature and not with the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the public act that created an administrative agency. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of this legislation on three grounds: (1) it authorized the use of public funds and the pledging of the faith and credit of the state for a private benefit which was not incidental to any public purpose. (2) it authorized the delegation of legislative power to the building commission without adequate standards to guide the commission. (3) it authorized the delegation of legislative power to a private corporation, and granted it an exclusive public emolument. The court concluded that the act sufficiently stated a public purpose and was not unconstitutional by reason of the fact that the purpose was not spelled out with clarion specificity. The court held that the act was not an illegal delegation of legislative authority to either the commission or the credit corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer sought review of the decision of the Superior Court in Fairfield County (Connecticut), which determined several questions concerning the legality of a contract made between defendant City of Norwalk, a corporation, and a railroad. The taxpayer sought an injunction restraining the city from taking any action or making any expenditures in connection with the construction of a bridge across the right of way of the railroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city had contracted with the corporation to allow the corporation to build a plant in a landlocked area; a new railroad bridge was required and electrical transmission wires had to be relocated. Pursuant to the contract, the city agreed to construct the bridge and pay one-half of its cost, to pay all the cost of relocating the wires, and to maintain the bridge or its replacement, while the railroad agreed to pay $ 25,000 of the cost and the corporation agreed to pay the difference. On review, the court found that the city charter gave it the power to lay out or extend any highway for public use and convenience, but that judicial review was available only to ascertain whether the city council's decision was made in bad faith, in clear abuse of power or in disregard of duty. The court found nothing to indicate bad faith and noted that private advantage did not defeat the public purpose of the project. The court ruled that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-98 required the railroad to pay one-half of the expense of the crossing, including the line relocation costs, and &sect; 16-11 required the railroad to keep the crossing in repair. The court found error in part and remanded the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court set aside the trial court's judgment in the taxpayer's action, and remanded with direction to render judgment as before but modified the judgment to state that the contract was not illegal and void except for the maintenance provisions and the provisions which required the city to pay more than one-half of the cost of relocating the transmission lines.</SPAN></P>

They claimed the election was illegal, and that one of the certificates had been disenfranchised from voting in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 33-311. The lower court concluded that the voting of the certificate that was owned by multiple persons should have been in accord with how a majority of the holders in interest in that certificate voted, the proposed stock issue was not legally ratified, and that the directors were not legally elected. On review, the court held that since a corporation could not issue fractional shares, the stockholders could not divide their voting privileges. The majority in interest of the owners of the certificate determined the way it should be voted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted that the magazines were not sent through the mail, but rather they were delivered to the store by railway express and personal delivery. Defendant claimed the antiobscenity statute was unconstitutional because it lacked a scienter requirement. The court, however, constructed the statute to incorporate scienter. The text and the accompanying photographs in the magazines were designed to appeal to the prurient interest of the average man. The magazines served no useful social purpose. Defendant knew the publications were obscene as evidenced by the way they were delivered, wrapped, and displayed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church owned property in an &quot;R-2&quot; residence zone on which it planned to build a school.

The town zoning commission denied the church's application for a special permit. The church brought a declaratory judgment action, arguing that the zoning ordinances were unconstitutional. The court declared that the ordinances were constitutional. The court found that in order to obtain a special permit the church had to submit a detailed plan of the proposed site, including the location of buildings, parking lots, traffic access and drives, and open areas. The court said there was a clear basis for these additional requirements because they encompassed the same requirements imposed on public schools at an earlier stage in the building process. The court pointed out that each public school building project required the approval of the planning commission or the municipal legislature and the filing of plans with the state before construction was begun. These requirements, the court said, tended to assure that the objectives of the zoning ordinance were safeguarded.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that the uniform statute,&nbsp;&sect; 19-246, made no distinction between possession or control of the drug for sale and possession or control for self-administration or by one who is an addict.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An information had charged defendant with committing the crime of permitting its dwelling units to be occupied by rent-paying tenants without obtaining the proper certificates as required by the town of Stratford's building code. A jury had found defendant guilty of this offense. Defendant argued that it was not bound by the requirements of the building code. Specifically, defendant argued that because the government had retained legal title to the property under a mortgage deed executed by the predecessor in title, the application of the building code to the property was contrary to the provisions of the federal constitution, and the Lanham Act, 1954 Conn. Pub. Acts 1125, as amended by 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1521. The court rejected this argument. There was nothing in the finding or the record that indicated the government intended to retain ownership, possession, or control of the property, or that it had in any way attempted to do so. Finally, the court held that the law of estoppel did not prevent the town from exercising its right to prosecute a violation of the building code. The court, finding no error, affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An out-of-state resident moved to Connecticut and eventually applied for welfare benefits. The State attempted to forcibly transfer the out-of-state resident to her home state, so that she could receive public assistance there, but she refused to do so. The State then filed an action for declaratory judgment and the trial court reserved questions for the advice of the court. The court held that when a person applied for welfare assistance, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-273a provided that any person who belonged to another state and came to reside in the state and became chargeable or made application for aid or was admitted to a state humane institution as an indigent person or pauper or otherwise, that person may be transported to his home state. However, the court stated that the facts stipulated in this case were wholly inadequate to furnish a proper basis on which to consider the constitutionality of a statute which had such far-reaching consequences as &sect; 17-273a. The court concluded that it would refuse to answer the questions reserved by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, to be constitutionally valid, a statute like &sect; 42-112, an exercise of the police power of the state, was required to meet a legitimate business purpose affecting the public health, safety, convenience, or welfare in a save and impartial way. The court found that &sect; 42-112 met that requirement. The court found, however, that a violation of &sect; 42-112 required a showing of the intent to harm competitors as a part of a prima facie case. Testimony taken by the commissioner that prices were lowered to attract customers into the owner's market was not sufficient to support a finding of intent to harm competitors or destroy competition, thus, the judgment finding that the owner violated &sect; 42-112 was set aside.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the argument that &sect; 10-186 was unconstitutional; the argument posited that &sect; 10-186 failed to set standards for the proper guidance of the Board.

The court ruled that any attempt on the part of the legislative department to direct what the rules should be and to determine what qualifications applicants for admission had to possess exceeded the constitutional power of that department; the court held that &sect; 51-82 was unconstitutional.The court's holding was based partly on history, which included the fact that 110 years before the adoption of the Connecticut Constitution of 1818 the General Assembly had assigned to the courts the business of admission of attorneys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners of all the movie theaters in a city contended that a city ordinance that required the presence and payment of police officers in their theaters was invalid. The owners' basic contentions were that the city charter conferred no power upon the city to enact an ordinance requiring the owners to pay for the services of policemen assigned to their theaters, that the ordinance was unconstitutional, and that Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29-109 vested in the state police exclusive jurisdiction to regulate movie theaters with respect to all personal hazards. The trial court found the city ordinance to be valid. On review, the court found that the ordinance required, as the statute and the regulations promulgated by the state police did not, the presence of a police officer to see to it that all ordinances and statutes were complied with. It embraced the protection of theater patrons from hazards unrelated to those connected with fire or panic; that is, it embraced the general preservation of order under any and all circumstances. Thus, the court found that the trial court properly concluded that &sect; 29-109 did not operate to supersede the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The building owner's building was damaged extensively in two separate fires. The chief inspector of licenses and inspections (chief inspector) ordered the demolition of the damaged building under the provisions of the Hartford building code, &sect; 43-37. The building owner filed suit to enjoin the chief inspector from enforcing his order. The building owner was denied relief. In affirming the decision, the court held that the challenged portion of &sect; 43-37 was not unconstitutional. Interpretation of &sect; 43-37 in harmony with Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19-378 and 19-391 led to the conclusion that damage to the building, to the extent of 50 percent, exclusive of the value of the foundation, was a sufficient standard for the guidance of the chief inspector. Otherwise, the unsightly remnants of a damaged building would remain until the ravages of time and the elements required common-law action to abate a nuisance. Further, the building owner did not take advantage of its right to appeal to the board of review. That appeal procedure, together with the building owner's right of recourse to the courts, satisfied the constitutional requirement of due process.</SPAN></P>

Section 10-281was not violative of equal protection because of an incidental benefit to the private school. The real benefit was to the town's families. The payments were not in violation of guarantees of freedom of religion because &sect; 10-281 served the public health, safety, and welfare. The aid was given to the parents, who were compelled by law to send their children to school, and the aid was not given to the private school. However, the use of monies from the &quot;school fund&quot; to pay for the transportation was unconstitutional because those funds were limited to expenditures to support and encourage public schools. Although the money from the town deposit fund was not governed by the &quot;school fund&quot; provision of Conn. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, it was also limited to public school expenses under Conn.

The court reasoned that Conn. Gen.

The court also concluded that the record indicated that developing a park for the number of mobile homes that the landowner contemplated could have involved the town in civic problems that affected the public health, safety, and welfare in ways that exceeded the town's resources. The court further found that the town's power to regulate mobile home parks entailed a certain degree of prohibition and that ordinance's placement of mobile homes and trailers in the same classification could not have been said to have been unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The river overflowed and destroyed the buildings and a bridge. A water resources commission, pursuant to Conn. Rev.

The landowner sought judicial review, and the trial court sustained the landowner's appeal of the commission's decision. The court set aside and remanded, holding that the commission was justified in refusing to allow the construction of the proposed structure by way of regulation rather than by way of eminent domain because it was not shown that the landowner was finally deprived by the commission of the reasonable and proper use of the property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer owned real and personal property subject to taxation in the town. The town assessed the taxpayer's real property at 50 percent of its actual value, the personal property other than motor vehicles at 90 percent, and the motor vehicles at 100 per cent. The taxpayer brought a proceeding for relief against the wrongful assessment of taxes upon personal property. The taxpayer claimed that all of its property should have been assessed at a single uniform percentage of its actual value. The taxpayer argued that the proceeding was not an appeal from the doings of the board of tax review under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-118 (Rev. to 1958)(Rev. to 1949, &sect; 1800), but was an application to the trial court for relief under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-119 (Rev. to 1997)(Rev. 1949, &sect; 1801). The town brought a demurrer. The parties entered into a stipulation of reservation for the taxpayer's argument. The demurrer was not acted upon by the trial court. The reservation came before the court. The court held that the taxpayer failed to show that it was entitled to relief under &sect; 119 because the taxpayer did not establish that the assessment on its personal property was &quot;manifestly excessive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held against the taxpayer and answered the question in the reservation of whether the taxpayer was entitled to relief in the negative.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that because an order directing the clerk of the Superior Court to issue an execution putting the agency into peaceable possession of the corporation's property could not be made if upon judicial review it was discovered that the taking of the property was illegal, the granting of the application for such an order constituted error. The court noted that the application should not be granted unless, upon judicial review, it was discovered that the taking of the property was legal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the demurrer, and defendant entered a plea of not guilty and elected to be tried to the court without a jury. The State withdrew two of the four counts. After a full hearing, the trial court found defendant guilty. Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court found no error. The court held that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated because &sect; 8567 was sufficiently explicit to inform those subject to it what conduct on their part would render them liable to its penalties.

In affirming, the supreme court ruled that private property was held subject to the police power and the ordinance was not an invalid delegation of legislative power to the town's plan and zoning commission, which had recommended approval of the plan. The ordinance was valid because it adequately contained the legislative policy and specific qualifications for the exercise of zoning powers. The ordinance was within the power conferred by the enabling acts, 19 Conn. Spec. Laws 935 and 22 Conn. Spec. Laws 473. Also, the developer's plan complied with the comprehensive plan for the town, such that the creation of the new zone was not arbitrary and did not constitute spot zoning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of selling non-antique merchandise, to wit, candles, on Sunday in violation of &sect; 3302d and appealed from the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Defendant alleged that the statute's classification violated the equal protection clause of both the Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. Upon review, the court found no error. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3302d (Supp. 1955) did not violate the equal protection clause by reason of the fact that the statute permitted the sale of certain specified articles while prohibiting the sale of all others, as long as the statute accorded the same rights to all who engaged in the same business. None of defendant's competitors were granted privileges not accorded to defendant. Section 3302d was uniform in its operation. The court further held that the classification of antiques among the articles exempt from the operation of the statute rested upon fair distinctions and bore a substantial relation to the purposes of the legislation. There was no basis for holding invalid the addition of antiques to the class of articles exempt from the operation of &sect; 3302d.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff town sought review of decision granting judgment for defendant insurance company in action brought to recover amount plaintiff paid in settlement of a suit against it. The court held that plaintiff did not violate the cooperation clause of its insurance policy by waiving the defense of inadequacy of notice through the enactment of 1953 Conn. Spec. Acts 6 validating inadequate notice of injury provided plaintiff. Plaintiff did not legislatively enact the validating act, but it was the state which brought about the enactment of 1953 Conn. Spec.

Acts 6 did not purport to, nor did it, directly affect contract of insurance or any term of that contract. Furthermore, because both plaintiff and defendant had knowledge of and investigated victim's injuries within the statutory 10 days, the General Assembly could well have considered 1953 Conn. Spec.

The power company applied, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5646, to develop a steam generating plant and received permission from the zoning commission.

The property owners association filed an appeal in the superior court, alleging that the public utility commission's decision did not comport with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5399. The appeal was dismissed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the decision rendered by the public utility commission was proper. The court reasoned that Conn. Gen.

The court concluded that it was not the function of the public utilities commission to prepare a finding such as is required by court appeals and it was sufficient that the finding and conclusions set forth the basic facts upon which it predicated its decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The housing authority began condemnation proceedings in the neighborhood of the landowners' properties in order to erect a moderate rental housing development, and it also purchased some land. The landowners filed an action against the housing authority to enjoin the development, and the trial court sustained the housing authority's demurrer. The landowners appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that there was no specific statutory provision allowing the landowners' recovery. Accordingly, because no land was physically taken from them, the prohibition in Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11 barred their action. The landowners' complaint did not set forth any facts entitling them to injunctive or declaratory relief on the ground of nuisance or under the Act by allegations that no emergency existed warranting the construction of the development, so it failed to state a cause of action for the relief claimed. Allegations of special irreparable injury and specifications of fact to support their claims were lacking. There was no authority for the landowners' assertions that zoning restrictions created a right in the nature of an easement in favor of their properties.</SPAN></P>

The facilities, consisting principally of machinery, were purchased to fulfill a facilities contract with the government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under a facilities contract awarded to the taxpayer, the taxpayer could use machinery that had been purchased for use in manufacturing military aircraft engines and parts. The taxpayer received no profit on the purchase and installation of the facilities. The court held that not only the express language of the contracts but the surrounding circumstances, including controlling government regulations and conduct of the parties, indicated that the government was the owner of all facilities from the moment of shipment by the vendors. As the purchase orders specified that shipment was f.o.b. the vendor's plant, title passed from the vendor upon delivery of the facilities to the carrier as agent. It was also consistent with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6634 of the Sales and Use Tax Act that payment only be postponed and, if later inspection disclosed the facilities were not as ordered, the government could rescind and refuse payment. As the taxpayer's use was merely to accomplish the government's purpose, its use was not incident to ownership and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2095(2) did not apply. To allow imposition of the use tax regardless of ownership violated the government's immunity from state tax.</SPAN></P>

As a crowd assembled, an officer was summoned, who refused to allow the owner to pay the fine and take his car, then arrested the owner for breach of the peace. The trial court dismissed the owner's suit for damages. In affirming, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. The court rejected the owner's claim that the parking ordinance was unconstitutional because it provided for the removal of cars whether they were occupied or not. The court found that the car was not occupied when it was ticketed and towed, that the officer was not guilty false arrest, and that the officer did not violate the owner's right in having the car impounded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The advertiser, through its employees, solicited contracts from prospective sellers to advertise their businesses or properties in two printed media published by a publisher under agreement with the advertiser.

Reversing, the court held that requiring plaintiffs to obtain real estate brokers' and salesmen's licenses was unnecessarily burdensome and discriminatory because their only business was advertising. The court, therefore, held that the provisions of the amendment that embraced plaintiffs' activities within the definition of &quot;engaging in the real estate business&quot; and the activities of a real estate broker or salesman violated the constitutional rights of plaintiffs and were null and void.</SPAN></P>

Before the jury was sworn, the trial judge determined that because the penalty for which defendant was charged was life imprisonment, his trial could be had only upon an indictment by a grand jury. The grand jury returned an indictment against defendant charging him under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3962, as well as being a third offender under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2103d, 2104d. The parties stipulated for reservation of advice from the court on various questions certain to enter into the decision of the case in the trial court. The major question was whether &sect;&sect; 2103d, 2104d were applicable since defendant's convictions occurred prior to the effective date of their passage. The court ruled that offenses occurring prior to the passage of &sect;&sect; 2103d, 2104d counted as offenses under the Act so as to authorize the imposition of the penalty for subsequent violations, such as life imprisonment. The court ruled that two statutory sections worked in tandem to ensure that prior convictions increased the penalties for subsequent convictions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 4307 was not unconstitutional for imposing liability without proof of a causal relationship between the sale of intoxicating liquor and the intoxication which caused the injury. The Dram Shop Act was a valid exercise of the legislature's police power. Also, the trial court's jury instruction on causation adequately informed the jury that the individuals were required to prove a proximate causal relationship between the party's intoxication and the injuries, although the term &quot;proximate cause&quot; was not employed. Further, the court ruled that the trial court properly denied the owner's motions to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to find that there was a sale of alcohol to an intoxicated person within the terms of the statute and that the damages awarded by the jury were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

When the trial court indicated to defendants' attorney that, in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3326d (1955 Cum.

Defendants were tried by a jury of six, which returned a verdict of guilty as to both defendants. The trial court convicted defendants of attempted theft. Defendants appealed, contending that a trial by six jurors violated Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 9, 21 and that defendants did not know that by failing to claim a jury of 12 they waived their right to it. On appeal, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3326d (1955 Cum. Supp.), in so far as it provided for a trial to a jury of six unless at the time defendants demanded a jury of 12, did not deprive defendants of their right of trial by jury and that there was no finding that defendants were ignorant of their rights and the way to protect them. So long as defendants' election stood as one for a trial by a jury of six, the trial court had no discretion but to deny them a trial by a jury of 12.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs owned property that was used for dwelling purposes and constituted controlled housing accommodations. They sought a declaration as to the validity of the city's ordinance, which forbid the use of summary process as a means of recovering possession due to a housing emergency, that was declared by the ordinance as a result of the second world war. The trial court reserved the question of the ordinance's validity. The court first addressed the issue of whether the city charter authorized the council to enact the ordinance limiting the use of summary process. The court found that temporary rent and eviction control legislation was within the police powers granted by the city charter. The court determined, however, that because the ordinance was in conflict with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 411, which authorized a landlord to evict a tenant by summary process, the ordinance was invalid. The court also ruled that the rent control provisions were so dependent upon the validity of the eviction controls that the invalid provision was not separable despite the city's inclusion of a separability clause in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the ordinance did not violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Connecticut Constitutions.

Moreover, the time fixed by the ordinance was not arbitrary and unreasonable because the town council was required to fix the time with certainty. In addition, the court rejected defendant's argument that the ordinance was discriminatory because an auctioneer licensed pursuant to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractor filed an application pursuant to Norwalk, Conn., Ordinance to Regulate the Removal of Soil for Sale or for Use Other Than on the Premises and Providing Penalties for the Violation Thereof (June 18, 1952) for permission to excavate and remove gravel from its land. After the completion of the proposed excavation, the contour of the land would be changed so that a slope would extend downhill from a public street. The contractor proposed to cover the slope with topsoil that would, unless properly seeded, wash off, leaving an unsightly condition. The city denied the application on the basis of evidence that the premises was located in a residential area, the excavation would reduce land values and produce health and safety hazards, the use of heavy equipment would create noise and dust and a traffic hazard, and the excavation would cause drainage problems and would leave a slope that was too steep to hold topsoil.

Defendant's principal contention was that the statute was discriminatory because, although it prohibited the sale of goods, wares, and merchandise generally on Sunday, it permitted the sale of a considerable number of specified articles. The court found that the issue was whether the statute, by denying to retailers of most kinds of food the right to sell on Sunday and at the same time permitting the sale of some kinds of food, treated the one class of retailers differently from the other when there was no substantial difference between them germane to the subject matter and purpose of the legislation.

The tenants also sought treble damages. The case was docketed as a jury case. The tenants moved to strike the case from the jury docket, and the trial court granted their motion. Judgment was rendered for the tenants. The court found that the underlying issue was whether the landlord was subject to a penalty in addition to the rent overcharge. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7936, as amended, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2387c, the present case was a civil action involving an issue which, prior to January 1, 1880, would not present a question properly cognizable in equity and therefore triable only to the court without a jury. The question, then, was whether the case was a &quot;special statutory proceeding,&quot; which entitled the landlord to a jury trial. The court found that the trial court erred in striking the case from the jury docket. Actions for treble damages under the Act were triable to a jury in the federal courts.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found the father's arguments without merit.

The court found the legislation was within the State's police powers as a legitimate regulation for the public safety and welfare. The court noted that in other states, statutes requiring a license to engage in the business of real estate broker or salesman were generally held not to be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal Constitution. They were sustained as a lawful exercise of the police power of the state in the interest of the public welfare. The court further noted that the legislative department was the judge, within reasonable limits, of what the public welfare required, and the wisdom of its legislation was not the concern of the courts. Courts would not hold laws, ordinances, or regulations adopted under sanction of law to be unconstitutional unless they were clearly unreasonable, destructive, or confiscatory. These regulations were clearly for the public's safety and protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The furniture company argued that the trial court erred in finding that the City had the power to prohibit the maintenance and erection of projecting advertising signs over sidewalks.

The court concluded that the passage of the ordinance by the City's common council was not an arbitrary, unreasonable, or invalid exercise of the police power that deprived the company of its property without due process of law. The court rejected an argument that the ordinance contained discriminatory features rendering it unconstitutional. The furniture company failed to persuade the court that once having erected an expensive sign, it therefore was entitled to have the sign endure notwithstanding the valid city ordinance. The court also rejected the claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it compelled the removal of overhanging signs without any prior determination that such signs were hazardous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A savings and loan association filed suit challenging an assessment of an additional corporation business tax upon the association's net income. The association contended that the assessment on dividends paid or credited to depositors on deposits or withdrawable accounts did not exist in the federal tax legislation and contended that the retroactive application of the state tax statute violated the due process clauses of the federal and statute constitutions. The court affirmed the superior court's order upholding the Tax Commissioner's assessment and concluded that the amount paid by the association as dividends or interest was interest paid within the meaning of the tax statute and thus, the amounts were properly taxable. Although the federal tax code allowed the deduction from gross income of dividends paid by banking corporations, the court held that the state legislature had the power to enact tax provisions different from those contained in the federal legislation. The court held the retroactive effect of the statute did not render it unconstitutional since the association would reasonably have anticipated either the nature or the amount of the tax it was expected to pay.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, reversed the lower court's judgment, and entered judgment in favor of the city. The court found that zoning regulations were required to have a rational relation to the health, welfare, safety, and prosperity of the community and that if this police power was reasonably exercised, the regulations would be upheld. The court found that the city's urgent traffic problems justified the rezoning regulations and that they were valid. However, the court found that even valid zoning regulations were unconstitutional if they were applied in an arbitrary or confiscatory manner and that the zoning board of appeals existed to assure that the regulations were properly applied. Thus, the court held that the landowners were not entitled to seek injunctive relief until they were granted or denied a variance, and the action of the zoning authorities had thus become complete and final. Accordingly, because the landowners had not sought a variance or relief from the zoning board of appeals, the court held that the injunction was improperly issued.</SPAN></P>

The commission denied the petition, and the association sought review. The trial court reserved to the court for the court's advice. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5673, the commission was required to order and direct the electric companies to distribute current in the state to extend their lines in their chartered territory to all &quot;unserved areas&quot; having a density of subscribers for electric service averaging at least two per mile. The court further found that, in fixing the rates, the commission was directed to exercise its statutory powers and to consider the expenses of the electric companies. The court determined that, under the statute, the trial court was only to require such extensions as the commission found reasonable under all circumstances. The court found that the factors that entered into the determination of reasonableness were the need and cost of the extension, the return to be expected, and the effect upon the electric companies' revenues. The court declined to answer the questions and remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court found the trial court properly presented the issue of whether defendant was guilty of murder only in the second degree where the jury charge emphasized that proof of willfulness, deliberation, and premeditation, beyond a reasonable doubt, was indispensable to a conviction of murder in the first degree. The court determined that defendant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1406b (Cum. Supp. 1951), where defendant was not harmed by application of the statute because the statute gave defendant a chance to receive a life sentence rather than a sentence of death, which was not an alternative prior to the passage of the statute. The court concluded that hypothetical questions presented to experts regarding defendant's mental capacity were properly excluded where the propounded questions sought to elicit an expression of opinion upon whether defendant acted in a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated manner, which were questions for the jury.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that the bequest was not subject to exemption where a trust company named in the bequest was not the entity that was to administer the charity pursuant to the terms of the will.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dental laboratory claimed that Conn. Gen.

The court held that the portion of &sect; 1696c that dealt with advertising was invalid but that the remaining portions were valid. The court determined that addressing the making, fitting, and repairing of artificial dentures constituted a calling intimately concerned with the public health and that one who pursued such activities was required to have an accurate knowledge of the physiology of the teeth and the parts of the human body associated with them as well as a high degree of technical skill. As such, the court found that the language of &sect; 1696c addressing those activities was designed to serve the public health effectively and was not an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the police power. The court opined, however, that the portion of &sect; 1696c that contained the prohibition against advertising was so sweeping in its effect that it was not a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were ordered by the tax commissioner to pay the succession tax laid upon the estate of the testatrix and the probate court confirmed the decision. The trial court affirmed the decision of the probate court. The main question was whether the amount of the federal estate tax should have been deducted from the gross estate in the determination of the net estate by which the succession tax was measured. Plaintiffs claimed that the amount paid to the federal government for the federal estate tax should not have been included in the net estate upon which a Connecticut succession tax was payable. The court held there was no error in the decision. The succession tax was a tax upon the privilege of beneficial succession and was levied with regard to that portion of the estate that would have passed to the transferees. That the base chosen for the computation of the tax included the amount of the federal estate tax was not in conflict with the fundamental theory of the legislation. The probate court construed the statute correctly, and the statute was one within the constitutional powers of the legislature to enact.</SPAN></P>

The doctor contended that another physician, whom he called in as a consultant, made the diagnosis of the patient. The court disagreed. The consultant doctor suggested that the patient continue on her prescribed medication and that efforts should be made to confirm whether she suffered from myocarditis, possible nephritis, and a possible malignant bowel, by x-ray and other tests. The doctor did not perform any tests to confirm the consulting doctor's tentative diagnosis. The doctor did not secure nurses for the patient. Instead, the doctor's mother, who was in her late seventies and had no nursing experience, cared for the patient. The patient was not admitted to the hospital until a week before she died. The court held that the Board would be justified in concluding that the care that the patient received from the doctor fell far short of what professional standards required.</SPAN></P>

The Town determined that for the 10-month change-over period, it would use the October 1950 tax list as the basis for the tax levy. The taxpayer filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the special act, arguing that it discriminated among taxpayers because it required those whose properties were assessed as of October 1950 to pay taxes on a valuation set as of that date, and freed from taxation entirely those whose properties were not on the list on October 1950. The trial court upheld the validity of the special act and the taxpayer appealed. The court stated an act was not discriminatory if it treated all persons who were in the same class on an equal basis and if there was a reasonable distinction between the members of that class and all other classes. The court concluded that the special act was not discriminatory because it treated equally all taxpayers whose property was listed on October 1950.</SPAN></P>

It held that it was permissible to regulate junk dealers in the interests of public safety and that the purpose of the statute was to assure that the junk business would be conducted in a legitimate manner. Further, the statute did not give the official any discretion once it was established that an applicant for a license was a suitable person and did not give the official any power over where the business was to be conducted under the license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that both statutes were an illegal and unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power of the General Assembly to an administrative board. The court determined that the power of the legislature to require a license for the transaction of business for the purpose of regulating its conduct was a proper exercise of police power. The court explained that the legislature's delegation of power was admissible if the statutes declared a legislative policy, established primary standards for carrying it out, or laid down an intelligible principle to which the administrative officer or body had to conform. The court noted that a sanitary code, authorized by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3800, provided safeguards and precautions for the care of patients in a hospital. The court concluded that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3823 indicated a policy on the part of the legislature of preserving the public health by a sanitary code. The court determined that Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The amendment to the zoning ordinance prohibited the use of land for residential purposes in an industrial zone. The town was neither well-settled nor an industrial community. The owner purchased a tract of land for the purpose of erecting dwelling houses. There were several dwelling houses in the residence &quot;B&quot; zone adjacent to his land. The westerly portion of his lot was located in the residential district. When the owner purchased the land, the zoning ordinance permitted the use of land in the industrial district for residential purposes. The owner's land was adapted for residential use, for which there was a demand. Upon review, the court found that a residential use of the owner's land was the highest and best use to which it could have been put. There was no demand for an industrial use of the land, nor was there likely to be such a demand in the near future. The amendment was not a valid exercise of police power because there was no rational relationship to the public health, safety, welfare and prosperity of the community. Because the amendment prevented the owner from using his land for any feasible purpose, it was unreasonable and confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The permittees sought to enjoin the Commission from imposing minimum consumer resale prices upon products they sold. They claimed that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated the due process clauses of both the federal and the State constitutions, it provided for an improper delegation of legislative power, and it contravened the interstate commerce clause of the federal constitution. The court held that the Act was not violative of the due process provisions of the federal and State constitutions because it was within the police power, and it was not discriminatory. The Act did make a differentiation between permittees for the retail sale of liquor not to be consumed on the premises and other retail permittees. There was no delegation of legislative powers to wholesalers. Even thought the Act imposed a condition upon the importation of alcoholic liquors into the State, it in no way contravened the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution. By virtue of the 21st Amendment, the states were free to enact laws prohibiting, restricting, or regulating the bringing of intoxicating liquors into their territories completely unfettered by the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

There was no direct evidence that the permittee authorized the employee to take such actions or that he was aware the employee was doing it. The committee concluded that each transaction was a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4306 and its regulation that required accurate invoices. The committee found that the permittee was an unsuitable person, which warranted the suspension of his permit. The permittee contended that the action of the commission was illegal and that &sect; 4306 was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court found that the use of &quot;allow&quot; in &sect; 4306 did not mean that the permittee had to have actual knowledge that the employee gave a rebate or free goods to its customer, the only question was whether the permittee was responsible for the employee's action in making the allowance. Under the circumstances, the permittee was responsible for the employee's conduct. Thus, the permittee violated &sect; 4306. The statute was constitutional because the permit was a privilege, not a right, and did not constitute property.</SPAN></P>

The state then abolished the fine arts commission and created a public works department. The public works commissioner asked the probate court to appoint him as successor trustee, but the probate court refused and appointed members of the commission on fine arts at the time it was abolished as trustees. In responding to certified questions, the court found that the probate court did not abuse its discretion in appointing the successor trustees. While the powers formerly granted to the commission on fine arts were transferred to the public works commissioner, so far as trusts were concerned, the only thing transferred was the power to act as trustee. No specific trusteeship was granted to the public works department. The court also found that the deceased's will did not contain any direction that public officials be named as the trustees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue in this case was whether the parking project, for which the act in question provided, was a legitimate public purpose. The court held that the aggravated nature of the traffic problem on city streets and the serious effect which it had upon a very large part of the public in such localities were matters of common knowledge of which courts could take judicial notice. The court held that the broad provision in Conn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, which vested the legislative power in the General Assembly, was subject to the limitation that an act which served no other purpose than individual gain or profit goes beyond the power of that body to enact and was necessarily void. However, the court held that the very substantial weight of authority supported the conclusion that the use in question, the parking project, was a legitimate public use. The court held that since the development and operation of parking facilities was a proper municipal function devoted to a public purpose, public property of all kinds, as well as public funds in the manner provided in the act, could be used for the purpose.</SPAN></P>

The superior court affirmed, stating that the remainderman was not aggrieved by the decision. In affirming, the court noted that a clause in decedent's will directed the executors to apply for an allowance for the widow's support while the estate was in the process of settlement and further directed that if, for any reason, allowance was not made, the executors were to pay the widow, for her support and maintenance, a monthly sum while the estate was in the process of settlement. Giving effect to the decedent's intention to provide liberally for his widow, the court stated that the widow was to receive the stated monthly sum either as an allowance or as a bequest. In reality, the clause was a pecuniary bequest made on condition. As such, even if the remainderman prevailed and the order for further allowance failed, the widow would have received the same sum by bequest. The remaindermen's pecuniary position would be the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The veteran became a firefighter for the City of Hartford after his service in World War I.

Upon retirement, he was entitled to add to the term of his service in World War I and World War II to his actual service for the city by virtue of Conn. Spec. Act No. 394 (1945). The veteran claimed that by reason of the 1949 Act, he was entitled to an additional credit of one month for each month of his service in the armed forces during World War II. Defendant asserted that the 1949 Act was invalid because it constituted exclusive emoluments to a group of policemen and firemen based upon no reasonable classification. The 1949 Act gave the extra benefits only to policemen and firemen who served the city prior to serving in World War II. The court held that the 1949 Act was unconstitutional because the preference of World War II veterans who were members of the police and fire departments before they entered military service over World War II veterans who were new to the departments after World War II was too nebulous to afford a reasonable basis for the difference in their treatment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the board of aldermen had no power to intervene where the petitioners sought to have their proposal acted upon at a general election. The town clerk was under the duty of incorporating the question in the warning for the general election because the proposed change in the charter was initiated by a petition filed with the town clerk and because the petition requested the submission of the question to the electorate at the general election.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's finding that the litigation was the result of malice had to be stricken because there was nothing in her conduct which would justify an inference of the existence of malice. Although the remedies sought as to the school house property were somewhat different, the cause of action of wrongful ejectment was the same. In addition it was of no consequence whether she was bound by the prior adjudication because it was sufficient that she had an interest in the subject matter and participated in the litigation. Although the order striking the forge property case from the docket was not a judgment on the merits, her acceptance of the monetary judgment in an action over the same set of facts was conclusive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff veteran police officers filed suit in the Superior Court in Fairfield County (Connecticut), seeking a writ of mandamus requiring defendant civil service commission and defendant personnel director to add points to their final earned ratings on an examination for promotion in the police department. The trial court reserved the action for the advice of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature passed a special act requiring the commission to add five points to the earned rating received by an honorably discharged war veteran taking an examination with the city and later amended the act to add similar points on promotional examinations. After the commission added points to the veteran officers' ratings on a promotional examination, defendant nonveteran officers challenged the constitutionality of the amendment. The court held that the amendment was valid because: (1) the legislature could reasonably have believed that extending preferential treatment to veterans taking civil service examinations served the genuine public purpose of encouraging patriotism; and (2) there was a natural and substantial difference between veterans and other citizens, and the difference was logically related to the purpose of the amendment, which was to encourage veterans to bring the qualities developed by military service to the service of the city. The court further held that the commission improperly applied the additional points only to the veteran officers' ratings on the written part of the examination, rather than to their final grades on the entire examination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the amendment was constitutional and that the &quot;earned rating&quot; to which the additional points were to be applied was the final rating attained by candidates on all subjects of examination.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion, concluding that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in coming to the opinion that the due administration of justice required a termination of the stay of execution. The property owners' claim that the trial court's conclusion that public interest would be prejudiced by further delay was not warranted. Whether the claim was valid was a question which would have to be determined upon the appeal from the order for immediate possession. That the claim was made was not of controlling moment in the determination of the motion.

In affirming the trial court's decision, the court determined that &sect; 4266 was a constitutional exercise of legislative power. The states were given broad police power to regulate alcoholic beverages under the Twenty-First Amendment. As such, they were permitted to adopt reasonably appropriate measures. A classification recognized by the Twenty-First Amendment was not forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, there was no illegal discrimination were there was a natural and substantial difference, germane to the purpose of legislation, between those in one distinct class who were dealt with in one way and those in a separate class who were dealt with in another fashion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was engaged in the business of supplying natural gas by pipeline. It held a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Federal Power Commission pursuant to the provisions of the Natural Gas Act of 1938. The court found that the Act was not unconstitutional because ample provision was made to insure the payment of just compensation for the taking, and due process, though not questioned by the landowner, was thoroughly provided for. The court construed the Act to authorize by implication the taking of a temporary interest in land which was reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes for which the taking of permanent easements was authorized. The property which the corporation was privileged to take was restricted to that which reasonably served the public use; more than that would have, in effect, been a taking for a private use and, hence, illegal as an abuse of power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question reserved was whether defendants or plaintiffs had been the de jure judges of the city court since July 1, 1951. The question turned upon whether Conn. Const. amend. XX and the statutes adopted thereunder operated to fix the terms of office of city court judges or whether they had been superseded by Conn. Const. amend. XLVII. The term of office, a vacancy in which defendants were appointed to fill, was for two years from July 1, 1949. Conn. Const. amend. XX was in effect at the time of their appointment and remained in effect until Conn. Const. amend. XLVII received the requisite implementation by act of the General Assembly. Conn. Const. amend. XX imposed a constitutional restraint upon any extension of the term of office of a municipal court judge beyond the period of two years. No legislative or executive act was able to override that restraint. Accordingly, the court concluded that defendants' terms of office expired on June 30, 1951. On July 1, 1951, there were vacancies in the terms of the offices which it was incumbent upon the governor to fill pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 92.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff former employee challenged a judgment of the Superior Court in New Haven County (Connecticut), which upheld a decision of an unemployment commissioner denying the employee's application for renewal of unemployment benefits. That decision was based on a determination that the employee had not received sufficient wages during the preceding base period to qualify as a beneficiary under the Connecticut Unemployment Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee would have qualified for renewal benefits if the Act had not been amended to require under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1389i (Supp. 1947) that the wage amount an unemployed person had to receive during his base period must have been paid in at least two different quarters of that period. Thus, the employee argued that he had a vested property right in benefits under the Act as it existed at the time of his discharge which could not constitutionally be affected by subsequent legislative action. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. A right was not vested unless it became a legal or equitable title to the present or future enjoyment of property. A savings clause in the original Act provided that the Connecticut General Assembly reserved the right to amend any part of the Act and that no vested private right prevented such an amendment. As a result, the employee's right to benefits at the time of his discharge was subject to the contingency of an amendment. As such, his right was conditional, and the reservation of power to amend justified as constitutional the changes made to benefit eligibility. Therefore, the employee's renewal application was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The trial court on appeal held that the zoning ordinances under which the Board purported to act were unconstitutional and void because they did not contain any rule or standard to guide or restrain the discretion of the Board, nor any comprehensive plan for uniformity, and, therefore, were illegal and an improper delegations of legislative power. The owners had utilized the regulations previously when they obtained permission to open their business.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the tenant argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a jury trial. In particular, the tenant claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 664a (1949 Cum. Supp.), which repealed Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8246, providing for a right in either a lessor or a lessee in moving for a jury trial, was unconstitutional. The court rejected the tenant's argument. In so ruling, the court noted that the issue of the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 664a (1949 Cum. Supp.) was not properly presented by the record. The court explained that if the Connecticut Legislature could have deprived litigants of a jury trial in a summary process, then the trial court's denial of the tenant's motion for a jury would not have presented an appellate issue. The court further observed that, on the other hand, if the right was guaranteed by the Connecticut Constitution, then the action of the Connecticut Legislature repealing the statute would have been void and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8276 (repealed) would have been controlling. Under &sect; 8276, a lessor or a lessee was required to request by motion a jury trial on or before the return day. The tenant, however, failed to make such a request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A third party had been operating a package store as a tenant of the father. The son wanted to obtain the permit and the third party was removed from the business by a judgment in summary process. The third party obtained a permit at a different location. The son claimed that since the father's premises had been used as a legal liquor outlet for more than 12 years, and since this use was not violative of the zoning ordinance, it constituted an existing &quot;permit premise,&quot; and the action in granting the third party's permit for his new location, when it knew that the son was going to apply for a permit for the old, was arbitrary and unreasonable. Only one of the two permits could have been awarded unless the number of outlets in the neighborhood was to be increased. The court found that if the Commission had reasonable cause to believe that granting a new permit would prove detrimental to the public interest, it was its duty under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4263(3) to refuse to do so. Permits to sell liquor in given vicinity were not necessarily mutually exclusive either in fact or law.

The court held that the consent requirement was unconstitutional. If the existence of a law depended upon the vote or act of the people, it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power; but if the law was complete in and of itself, the fact that it provided for the removal or modification of its prohibition by the act of those most affected thereby did not make it a delegation of legislative power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an oil company denied liability in the state's action to recover taxes from the sale of gasoline, the general assembly enacted Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 400i (Supp. 1947). The oil company amended its answer to include the special defense that &sect; 400i authorized it to retain one percent of the tax on all gasoline. The state demurred, and the case was reserved to the court. The court advised the trial court that the demurrer should be overruled. The first ground of demurrer, namely, that the general assembly improperly gave money belonging to the state to the distributors and gave them exclusive privileges, was unsound. The distributors, in collecting the tax, were acting as agents for the state; allowing them to retain a reasonable sum for their services was proper. The general assembly could also grant compensation retrospectively for equitable reasons. The general assembly could properly consider that it was unfair to the distributors, after state officials and the distributors had assumed for ten years that the distributors had the statutory right to retain the one percent, to require them to pay back the money to the state. The statute on its face was not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The successor judges were appointed by the General Assembly to hold office for two years. The appointed judges were appointed by the governor to replace the successor judges. The court held that the appointed judges had the right to hold the offices. The court held that Conn.

One appointed to fill a vacancy held office only until the expiration of the term established for the person whose place he took. Because the successor judges were appointed for a period of two years, their terms of office expired after two years. Furthermore, the amendments extending prior appointments were passed after the successor judges were appointed and statutes affecting substantial changes in the law were not to be construed to have retroactive effect unless the intent was clear. The governor's appointment of the appointed judges was valid because the senate had adjourned sine die, giving the governor the power to make vacancy appointments.</SPAN></P>

Bridgeport, Conn., Zoning Regulations &sect; 6(B)(2) and (3) were at issue. Section 6(B)(2) had been previously held valid in another case. Finding no error in the trial court's judgment, the court found that the power of the Commission as a subdivision of the State was to regulate and restrict the business of the sale of liquor. Its power was far broader than a power to regulate or restrict ordinary lawful business. The use of property for the sale of liquor was deemed by the legislative authority to have a far more harmful effect upon the health and welfare of the community than an ordinary business. The only places for the sale of liquor which would have been a conforming use would have been those which were so situated that there was not another place for the sale of liquor within the 1500-foot radius.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court in New Haven County at Waterbury (Connecticut) brought questions in plaintiff Connecticut Tax Commissioner's suit for a declaratory judgment to determine whether defendant Assessor of the City of Waterbury had the right to grant tax exemptions to veterans not domiciled in Connecticut at the time of induction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">State tax statutes granted limited exemptions from the Connecticut property tax to those in the armed services, those who had served, or their dependents. The Commissioner claimed that the statutes had to be interpreted as restricted to those who were serving or had served as a portion of a quota for Connecticut. Answering the first question, the court said that exemptions from the Connecticut property tax for those who were not state residents at the time of their enlistment or induction and who did not serve as a part of the Connecticut quota were within the meaning of statutes and were valid. It was not the legislative intent in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 158f (Supp. 1941) to restrict the grant to persons who served as a part of the Connecticut quota. Nothing in the statute suggested such a limitation, and the court could not read such a provision into it. The terms of the statute permitted no severance, which would have to be made between two groups that fell within the broad language of the law. If taxes could be laid to show gratitude for meritorious military service, veterans could properly be exempted from the payment of a portion of the taxes levied on the people of a state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant tax commissioner appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in Hartford County (Connecticut), which held that plaintiff corporation was within the terms of the Corporation Business Tax Act of 1935 (Act), Cum. Supp. 1935, Chap. 66b, &sect; 416c et seq., that the Act did not as applied violate the state constitution, but that the Act as applied to the corporation was unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was a foreign corporation engaged in the transportation of freight in interstate commerce. The commissioner assessed a certain tax against it under the Act, which imposed a tax upon the franchise or privilege of a corporation to do business within the state. The tax was to be upon a base that reasonably represented the proportion of the trade or business carried on within the state. The corporation brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment as to whether assessments made against it were illegal and void. The court found that the corporation was doing business within the state, though that business was interstate in character. Its business was within the purview of the Act. The corporation argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not impose a tax upon partnerships or individuals engaged in the same business. The court held that the tax was upon the privilege which existed in conducting business with the advantages which inhered in the corporate capacity of those taxed. Those advantages created a distinct privilege. The classification was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious and was not, therefore, violative of the state unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court erred in deciding the issue of whether the Act was in violation of the U.S. Constitution but that its conclusions that the Act did not violate the state constitution and that the assessments were not illegal were correct. It directed the trial court to enter judgment as on file except that the provisions that the Act was violative of the U.S. Constitution was to be eliminated.</SPAN></P>

The district, towns, and their creditors sought declarations from the court regarding the legal validity, powers, and obligations of the regional school district. The court concluded that pursuant to the state's plenary power to establish school districts and as recognized by a special act of the state general assembly, the regional school district, had a legal existence as a quasi-municipal corporation established by the state to carry out its governmental purposes. The court reasoned that as such, none of the towns had the power to withdraw or dissolve the school district without legislative authority. The court also advised that the creditors' claims were not suitable for determination in the declaratory judgment action, and should be pursued as contract actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant filed an application for a wholesaler permit which showed that the proposed backer was a New York corporation which was also a backer on a Connecticut out-of-state shipper's permit for beer only. The commission denied the application because the permit already held by the backer was in a different class from the one for which the application was made. The trial court sustained the commission's decision. On appeal, the court determined that the Liquor Control Act did not expressly or by implication exclude that application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 968e (Sup. 1939), which prohibited the backer or permittee of one class of permit from being the backer or permittee of another class, to an out-of-state shipper's permit. The court found that it was not permitted to read an exception into that section to avoid consequences so absurd or unreasonable that the legislature must have been presumed not to have intended them and that the denial of the permit in question was mandatory under the statute. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

After careful examination of the specific circumstances of the instant case and despite the trial court's use of a curative instruction, the court held, on the basis of the severity of the misconduct, its centrality to the critical issues in the case, and the weakness of the state's case, that the prosecutor's misconduct deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which convicted him, after a conditional plea of nolo contendere pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-94a, of possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-277(a). Defendant alleged the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped for speeding. When defendant was given the citation, he was asked to step out of his vehicle. Defendant complied and was then asked for permission to search the vehicle. Defendant consented and cocaine was found in a bag in the trunk. Defendant then volunteered there were more drugs in the console between the seats. Defendant was arrested and the police searched the vehicle, finding the other drugs. Defendant entered a conditional nolo contendere plea under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-94a to possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-277(a). Defendant appealed alleging the trial court improperly concluded that his detention by police following a traffic stop was not unjustifiably prolonged and that he had voluntarily consented to a search of his vehicle. The court affirmed, finding that defendant was free to leave at the time he was asked to exit his vehicle. The court held that whether a restraint of freedom of movement existed was a factual determination not to be overturned unless clearly erroneous. The court found defendant's will was not overborne and his consent was not an unconstrained choice.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument that his admission to being a drug addict lessened the prosecution's burden of proof because being drug dependent was not the same as being in possession of drugs at the time of his arrest. Defendant's claim that prosecuting him for both the possession and the sale of narcotics was double jeopardy was rejected because the two offenses had different elements. Defendant's claim that his sentence was an abuse of discretion was also denied because the sentences imposed were within the statutory limits for the offenses.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53a-136 and assault in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-61. Defendant appealed, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the law of reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence, thereby depriving him of his rights under the state and federal constitutions. Specifically, he raised six claims regarding the jury instructions. The appellate court addressed each claim. Defendant sought review under Golding on three unpreserved claims. The appellate court found that two of the claims were not entitled to review because the instructions at issue did not constitute constitutional violations; nor did either involve plain error. Defendant's claim concerning the presumption of innocence was reviewable because it alleged the violation of a constitutional right, but it failed the third prong of Golding. Under the third prong, defendant could have prevailed on an unpreserved constitutional claim of instructional error only if from the substance of the charge rather than its form, it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, operating a vehicle with a suspended license, and failure to drive on the right. At the time the defendant was stopped by the police for erratic driving while returning from a fishing trip, he was in possession of a work permit, a conditional driver's license permitting the defendant to drive for work purposes only. At trial, the defendant asserted that he could not be convicted of driving on a suspended license in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-215 because he was in possession of a valid work permit. The lower court rejected his argument and instructed the jury to find the defendant guilty if he had not proved by a &quot;preponderance&quot; of the evidence that he was driving within the context of the work permit. The appellate court found that the lower court mis-instructed the jury by inferring that some part of the burden of proof was on the defendant, rather than emphasizing the fact that the defendant was innocent until proven guilty.

Stat. &sect; 14-111c as a result of plaintiff's conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol. The lower court affirmed defendant's decision and plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant did not commit error in admitting her conviction and that the driver's license compact did not violate the double jeopardy clause. According to the appeals court, administrative tribunals were not strictly bound by the rules of evidence and they could consider evidence which would normally be incompetent in a judicial proceeding, so long as the evidence was reliable and probative. The appeals court held that the evidence concerning plaintiff's conviction in Florida was reliable and probative and was admissible. Next, the appeals court held that plaintiff's one year license suspension did not violate the double jeopardy clause because a civil or administrative sanction that served a legitimate remedial purpose and was related rationally to that purpose did not give rise to a double jeopardy violation even if the sanction had some deterrent effect.</SPAN></P>

The court held that given the state trooper's testimony that defendant was driving at seventy-four miles per hour in a posted fifty-five miles per hour zone and defendant's testimony that did not include the speed at which he was traveling, lower court's statement that there was absolutely no evidence of defendant's not speeding was an observation that there was no evidence contradicting the trooper's testimony rather than a shifting of the burden of proof.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his convictions on a jury verdict in the Superior Court (Connecticut) for armed robbery and carrying a pistol without a permit. Defendant claimed the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury on the essential elements of robbery, improperly determined that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and improperly failed to find prosecutorial misconduct in the prosecutor's final summation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed he was entitled to have his two first-degree robbery convictions reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the statutory elements of robbery. Although defendant failed to preserve the error for review, the trial court was constitutionally required to instruct the jury properly on every essential element of the crime charged and the court reversed and remanded. It could not be considered harmless error for a jury to find an accused guilty without knowing what the essential elements of the crimes charged were. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the intent requirements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-133 was harmful error mandating reversal. Further, even if the conviction had been upheld, defendant was incorrectly sentenced under &sect; 53-202k, which was intended to serve as a sentence enhancement provision, not as a separate crime under which a defendant could be convicted. However, defendant's claim that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury on attempted robbery failed because an unsuccessful robbery was not the same as an attempted robbery and the evidence was sufficient to prove defendant acted as a principal in the robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions for first-degree robbery were reversed and remanded because the lower court failed to properly instruct the jury as to the statutory elements of the crime charged and he was erroneously convicted under a sentencing enhancement provision for committing a felony with a firearm. Defendant's conviction as a principal was affirmed because the evidence was sufficient to prove defendant threatened the immediate use of force.</SPAN></P>

In 1973, the city and library contracted that the transcripts be retained at the library as historical records, but that they be sealed for 50 years. The reporter and paper argued that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for the commission's. On remand, the appellate court held that although the trial court found that the commission made no finding as to the 1964 investigation's legality, the trial court itself did not purport to make such related findings. The trial court was not required to defer to the commission's legal conclusions in that the commission's construction of the federal contract clause had not previously undergone judicial scrutiny. The paper failed to adequately brief the issue whether the contract clause was limited to property interests cases. Exchange of promises was sufficient consideration. Applying the Freedom of Information Act in the case would have definitely impaired the contractual relationship.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with one count of risk of injury to a child and one count of unlawful restraint in the second degree after he pushed his minor daughter down to the ground, and made several unsuccessful attempts to force his tongue into her mouth. At the time of his arrest, defendant was on probation for a conviction of sexual assault. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court considered the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 in relation to defendant's claims that &sect; 53-21 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of his case. The court found that defendant had fair warning that his actions toward the victim violated the second prong of &sect; 53-21, and therefore his challenge failed. The court reasoned that prior case law on this issue, in conjunction with the exercise of common sense, constituted fair warning to defendant that his actions were in violation of &sect; 53-21. The court further held that the Pickering standard meant that while a defendant who deliberately and improperly touched the private parts of a minor was clearly a hard-core violator of &sect; 53-21, such conduct was not necessarily the only type of conduct that was proscribed under the statute.</SPAN></P>

The state claimed that defendant clearly intended to harass victims by communicating with a third party by mail in an effort to cause such harassment. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court held that: (1) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibited intentional harassment by means of mail and did not seek to regulate the content of such mailings, which would encumber freedom of speech; (2) a person of ordinary intelligence would have fair warning that defendant's outrageous conduct was prohibited under &sect; 53a-183(a)(2); and (3) defendant failed to meet the burden of proof that &sect; 53a-183 (a) (2) was unconstitutionally void for vagueness beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he argued that this violated his due process rights. The appellate court disagreed. The instruction was proper, and the trial court was not obliged to enumerate the innocent explanations defendant offered. He was not entitled to an instruction that the jury had find facts proved by circumstantial evidence, or any logical inferences from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt; the State needed to prove only that the cumulative impact of the facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted intentionally. The jury charge on reasonable doubt was proper, as it followed United States Supreme Court's recommendation for such an instruction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed his convictions. The court held that the trial court properly restricted defendant's cross-examination of the witness to whom the victim first revealed the sexual abuse. The court determined that defendant failed to lay the required evidentiary foundation before raising the issue of third party culpability and failed to establish how the issue was relevant to the witness's credibility. Therefore, the court ruled that defendant was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The court held that alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not deprive defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. The court determined that defendant failed to preserve his objections to the conduct and that statements by the prosecutor during his closing argument were not so egregious as to implicate defendant's right to due process. The court ruled that the prosecutor did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to defendant to prove that the victim had fabricated the charge of sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer provided a policy of automobile insurance to the insured.

Subsequently, the insurer paid certain funds for medical costs and other benefits pursuant to the basic reparations benefits portion of the policy. The insured later reached a settlement with a third-party tortfeasor. The insurer then sought to recover the reparations benefits paid. The referee determined the insurer was not entitled to recover reparations benefits paid, and recommended judgment for the insured. The trial court accepted the referee's report over the insurer's objections. On appeal, the insurer claimed the trial court improperly concluded the right to recover basic reparations benefits was extinguished when 1993 Conn. Acts 297 repealed Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-369. The insurer also claimed the application of the changes mandated in 1993 Conn. Acts 297 violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 (contracts clause). The court affirmed the judgment because the insurer did not have a vested right to recover the benefits as of the date of the accident and the insurer failed to demonstrate a substantial impairment of its contractual rights.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court found that the trial court had properly found that there was ample evidence to support the hearing officer's determination that there was probable cause to arrest the driver. Given the trooper's testimony and the certification of the testing equipment by the health department, the court determined that the trial court had ample evidence to conclude that the machine was functioning properly. The court rejected the driver's claims that the statutes did not give fair warning because an ordinary person had no ascertainable means of measuring his or her own blood alcohol content. The court found that those who drank a substantial amount of alcohol within a relatively short period of time were given clear warning that to avoid possible criminal behavior they had to refrain from driving.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, suspended plaintiff driver's license to operate a motor vehicle for failing a chemical blood alcohol test. The Commissioner's determination was affirmed in an administrative hearing and the driver sought review. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain (Connecticut) dismissed the driver's appeal and he sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver claimed that the lower court acted improperly in dismissing his administrative appeal because the hearing officer misapplied the presumption of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14b-227b (f) to the facts of this case. The driver also argued that the presumption of &sect; 14-227b was unconstitutional as applied to him because there was no rational connection between the test results and the presumed fact that he had a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or greater at the time of operation. The court rejected these claims and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that its opinion in Bancroft v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 48 Conn. App. 391, 710 A.2d 807 (1998), decided the issues raised by the plaintiff's first claim; the court incorporated that analysis into its opinion. In addition, the court rejected the driver's constitutional claim based on its analysis in Bancroft and on the right of the hearing officer to disbelieve the driver's expert.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wanted her ex-husband killed because she suspected that he or his roommate were victimizing her children. A police informant arranged for a hit man, who was actually a police officer, to meet with defendant to perform the killing.

On appeal, defendant asserted that the language in &sect; 53a-179a was vague on its face because it lacked a common core meaning and prohibited speech protected by the First Amendment. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the statute required an intent to cause injury in addition to the proscribed language. The court also rejected defendant's First Amendment challenge. The court held that the statute did not allow a person to be prosecuted for a mere expression of opinion without any criminal intent or criminal act.

For his part, defendant was convicted of two counts of manslaughter as an accessory, one count of commission of felony with a firearm, and one count of carrying a firearm without a permit. Defendant appealed and asserted that the trial court improperly struck the testimony of an expert witness regarding behavioral changes caused by the use of an intoxicant, instructed the jury that it should draw an inference if the inference was reasonable, and denied defendant's motion to suppress his confession. On review, the court rejected each of these contentions. However, the court did find that defendant was entitled to have his conviction under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), which convicted defendant of four counts of kidnapping in the first degree, one count of robbery in the first degree, two counts of robbery in the second degree, and one count of commission of a class A, B, or C felony with a firearm.

Defendant claimed on appeal that the trial court improperly refused to suppress out-of-court identifications of him made by witnesses and that remarks made by the prosecutor during the state's closing argument impermissibly infringed on his constitutional right to testify. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction holding that the on-the-scene identification procedure used by the police was reasonably necessary because it allowed the witnesses to view the suspect while their memories of the incident were still fresh. The court further held that the prosecutor's remarks on defendant's credibility were proper and did not invite the jury to draw an inference adverse to defendant solely on account of defendant's assertion of his right to testify as defendant opened up the issue of his credibility. The court vacated defendant's conviction, however, to permit resentencing as the trial court erred by treating an enhancement provision of one of defendant's crimes as a separate offense in calculating prison time.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the evidence established that defendant possessed a forged document in that a security video showed him signing a stolen check and giving it to a cashier. The court found sufficient evidence to support the credit card theft convictions because the victim's identification of her credit cards was adequate to find that the cards enabled her to receive things &quot;on credit&quot; under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-128a(b). The court found no error in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial arguing that the state violated an order in limine because the jury's use of evidence that the detective watched defendant in the store because he bought high-ticket items the previous day was limited by a proper curative instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of New Haven (Connecticut) after he was convicted of attempt to commit murder, pursuant to Conn.

On appeal from his convictions, the court rejected defendant's argument that the State was required, in order to convict defendant of attempt to commit murder, to prove that defendant &quot;planned&quot; to murder the officer on the roof. Instead, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for attempt to commit murder because the jury could have found that defendant's act of advancing towards the officer while holding the knife in a menacing manner was a substantial step in a course of conduct that was planned to culminate in the murder of the officer. Upon considering the State's comment that defendant chose to testify because he believed the State's evidence against him was strong, the court found that the comment amounted to a denial of defendant's due process rights. Moreover, the State had not proven that the comment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the critical question in the case was whether the officer or defendant, the only eyewitnesses to the events, was telling the truth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Witnesses implicated defendant in a shooting. Tests of the truck defendant had been driving revealed elements characteristic of gunshot residue. Defendant made some statements to police. Defendant was charged and convicted of murder as an accessory in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-54a and 53a-8 and conspiracy to commit murder in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-48 (a) and 53a-54a. Defendant appealed and asserted that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress statements and physical evidence, denied his motion to suppress an out-of-court identification, charged the jury on accessorial liability, and marshaled the evidence in favor of the state during its charge to the jury. On review, the court rejected these contentions. The court found that the statements taken and gun residue were not the fruit of a de facto illegal arrest. Further, defendant did not have standing to challenge the search of the truck because he had no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding the search. The court found that the jury instructions were proper. Also, the trial court did not improperly direct the jury's attention to the testimony favorable to the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court's failure to give limiting instructions concerning the use of prior conviction and misconduct evidence, coupled with improper statements made by the prosecutor, constituted plain error. Because defendant failed to preserve the claim for review, he argued that he was entitled to plain error review. The court rejected defendant's claim and affirmed his conviction, finding that plain error review was reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error was so obvious that it affected the fairness and integrity of, and public confidence in, the judicial proceedings. The court determined that the claimed error was not such an &quot;obvious&quot; error. Further, the court failed to see how the prosecutor's remarks were so abusive or prejudicial as to deprive defendant of a fair trial and, therefore, concluded that defendant had waived his right to raise the claim of prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, the court found that convictions for sexual assault and unlawful restraint did not violate defendant's right against double jeopardy because the two crimes each required proof of a fact not required for conviction of the other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent mother appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Middelsex, Juvenile Matters at Middletown (Connecticut), which granted petitioner father's request to remove the mother as guardian of the parties' minor child and granted him sole guardianship and custody pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-610.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the mother contended that the superior court should have addressed the alleged impropriety of a prior order of temporary custody before considering the petition for removal of guardianship. The court concluded, however, that any issues involving the order of temporary custody were moot because that order was subsumed by the order appealed from, which granted sole custody and guardianship to the father. The mother also claimed that the trial court improperly applied only the best interests of the child standard of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-605 instead of finding a statutory basis for removing her as guardian as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-610. The court disagreed and found that the record amply supported the trial court's conclusion that the evidence satisfied the clear and convincing standard of &sect; 45a-610 as well as the best interests of the child standard of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-605. Finally, the court found that the mother's claim that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 45a-607, 45a-610 was unconstitutional was untimely and that the mother failed to demonstrate any exceptional circumstances that would allow the court to consider the claim.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed that three of the statutes were unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The stalking in the second degree statute was not unconstitutionally vague because its ambiguities were not so significant to render it void for vagueness and it provided sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary enforcement. The disorderly conduct statute was unconstitutional on its face because the terms &quot;annoy, offensive, and disorderly&quot; were vague. Although judicial gloss had been applied to those terms, defendant's conviction occurred before the gloss was applied. The harassment statute was not unconstitutionally vague although it contained the term &quot;annoy&quot; because judicial gloss was previously applied, nor was the statute unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct because he previously violated the statute and was on notice of the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the confession was voluntary and knowing, where the minor and his mother acknowledged in writing that they had received and understood the Miranda warnings. The court found that the mother was given ample time to talk privately with her son, but chose not to, and that the confession was taken in the mother's presence even though, at her request, she was sitting in the hallway and did not have eye contact with her son. The court found that the mother chose this arrangement after it became apparent to her that her son had murdered her mother, and she could no longer tolerate looking at him. The court held that the failure to record the reading of his rights was not a due process violation, and that statements made to a friend were admissible even though they were made without the presence of a parent.

A man with the same rolled up blue shirt sleeves and voice came up behind her, put a gun to her head, and demanded money. The robber demanded money from another employee and the owner of the company and shot and killed them both. The court found that the affidavit accompanying the arrest warrant presented a substantial factual basis to support the issuing judge's conclusion that probable cause for the lineup and the voice sample existed based on the surviving employee's description of the gunman. The identification procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive, even though the employee was shown photographs of defendant in arrays on several occasions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding expert testimony on the subject of eyewitness identification after concluding that the proffered testimony was within the general knowledge of the jurors. The trial court properly admitted evidence of prior robbery convictions because it was relevant to prove identity and to show a common scheme of criminal activity as the characteristics of the four robberies were sufficiently distinctive and unique.</SPAN></P>

Defendant allegedly penetrated a child's vagina with his finger and asked her to touch his penis. He was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree, two counts of risk of injury to a child, and sexual assault in the fourth degree. The court reversed defendant's conviction for sexual assault in the first degree and remanded with direction to render a judgment of not guilty on that charge and guilty of sexual assault in the second degree. The evidence did not support a conclusion that the acts occurred after the effective date of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a)(2) (1991). Defendant failed to sustain his burden of establishing even an inference that the victim's prior allegation of sexual abuse was false in order to question her about other allegations of abuse. Defendant was not deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine a videotaped interview of the victim before trial and before her testimony. He had the opportunity to cross-examine the victim regarding any claimed inconsistencies. The prosecutor's comments regarding defendant's use of alcohol did not deny him a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the refusal to dismiss the information charging the violation of &sect; 21a-278(a) was not erroneous. The trial court did not err when it provided the jury with summaries of the incriminating evidence from which it could find defendant guilty. As defendant failed to object to the instructions, the court was limited to review the claim for constitutional error. The court found that defendant's constitutional right to a fair trial was not violated.

The show-up identification was conducted while defendant and other suspects were standing in a line-up, handcuffed, surrounded by police officers, and next to the car in which they were stopped. The court determined that the identification process was suggestive but not unnecessarily so. The identification procedure did not give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. The court stated that the exigencies of the situation justified the procedure that was followed. Furthermore, the court found that the identification was reliable. The court considered the witnesses' degree of attention during roadside show-up, the accuracy of their prior descriptions, their levels of certainty, and the length of time between the crimes and the identifications in determining the reliability of the identifications.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. In so ruling, the court noted that Conn. Gen.

Stat. &sect; 12-242b(b) provided that the estimated tax stated in the declaration was the amount of money that the company estimated would equal the total tax that it would be required to pay. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-242c required payments of estimated tax. Because &sect; 12-242c had been complied with, &sect; 12-242d, entitled &quot;interest on unpaid installments&quot; was not called into play. Indeed, the only way that a corporate taxpayer could fall within the purview of &sect; 12-242d was if it made an unreasonable estimate or if it did not pay the requisite percentages set forth in &sect; 12-242c.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court improperly allowed the state to amend the information on the day jury selection commenced, denied the defendant's motion in limine to limit the cross-examination of the defendant, allowed the state's cross-examination of the defendant to exceed the scope of the direct examination, struck the defendant's entire testimony when he refused to answer certain questions after the court ordered him to do so, denied his motion to dismiss that alleged that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions, and denied his motion to dismiss based on a claim that &sect; 53a-181d was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to him. The court concluded that defendant had failed to establish that his defense was prejudiced by the addition of the new counts on the eve of trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on the victim's voice identification of defendant he was convicted on 25 counts of harassment in the second degree. He challenged his conviction and argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions, his trial on each count should have been severed, and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183 was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the voice identification of the victim provided sufficient evidence of his identity to support the conviction. The victim received numerous phone calls from the same person and had talked to defendant in person, thus she could recognize his voice. Based on the time of day of the calls and the fact that she asked defendant to stop calling his intent to harass was sufficiently proved. Severance was not required because defendant failed to show that the failure to severe the trial resulted in substantial injustice and each count could have been used as evidence in the trial on the other counts. Further, he failed to the reason he wanted to testify as to some of the counts and not as to others. The statute was previously held to be constitutional and he failed to properly brief the issue for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a town and its health director, filed an action against defendant property owner, seeking injunctive and other relief for the owner's alleged conversion of a summer cottage into to a year-round residence without meeting the requirements of the public health code, Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 19-13-B100. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Middlesex (Connecticut) rendered judgment for the owner and plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The director sent the owner a notice of violation stating that she was in violation of &sect; 19-13-B100, by her year-round use of public sewers, and notifying her that she could appeal the order by telephoning the agency within 48 hours and that a letter of appeal was required to be sent within seven days, under Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 19-2a-34. The owner timely indicated her intent to appeal the order by telephoning the agency but, because she did not file a letter of appeal timely, her administrative appeal was dismissed. The director then filed the suit to enjoin the owners' year-round use of the sewers. In reversing the superior court's decision that denied plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief, the court agreed with plaintiffs' contention that the superior court improperly required the plaintiffs to prove a violation of the public health code even though the owner failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. The court reasoned that it would violate the exhaustion doctrine and its policy underpinnings to allow a defendant who did not exhaust administrative remedies to defeat an agency's injunction action on issues that could have been contested in the administrative process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of several drug-related offenses.

Defendant filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus, the habeas court accepted a stipulation in which the State and defendant agreed that defendant's right to appeal should be restored, and defendant filed a direct appeal. Affirming the conviction, the court ruled (1) that the victim's testimony about two past incidents in which she was sexually assaulted by other men and nothing was done after she reported the incidents was admissible to explain her delay in reporting the assault by defendant; (2) that the trial court properly permitted the State to exercise a peremptory challenge to dismiss a venireperson accepted by both parties; (3) that the State's questions during cross-examination of the sole defense witness, which defendant claimed improperly misled the jury, were neither inflammatory nor likely to have contributed to the guilty verdict and therefore did not amount to prosecutorial misconduct; and (4) that the State's comments during rebuttal argument did not improperly shift the burden to defendant to prove his innocence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the charge allowed the jury to make a permissive inference in that it could consider the test results and attach whatever weight it chose to them. The charge did not impermissibly allow the State to use an evidentiary presumption to relieve itself of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every essential element of a crime. The jury was never instructed that the presumption or inference was mandatory, and the burden of persuasion never shifted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband filed an appeal form (JD-FM-111) within 14 days of the family support magistrate's order. The husband did not file a separate petition with the appeal form as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-231(n). Affirming the trial court's dismissal of the appeal, the court held that the husband had failed to comply with the strict statutory requirements. The appeal form itself stated that a petition was required to be filed with the form. The form was not itself the equivalent of a petition because it provided no place for the husband to give notice of his claims or challenges to the ruling of the magistrate. Because the husband lacked standing, the court lacked jurisdiction and properly dismissed the appeal. The court rejected the attorney general's contention that the appeal was moot based on the husband's payment of the $ 1,500 toward the arrearage because the appeal could have challenged more than the lump sum payment. The court rejected the husband's claim that &sect; 46b-231(n) was unconstitutional because the husband had sought the benefits of the statute. Any relief arising from unconstitutionality could not be claimed in the present action.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld defendant's conviction and sentence. First, the court held that drug dependency was not an element of the offense, but was an exemption from liability. A person charged with sale of narcotics pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b) was presumed not to have been drug-dependent, but could avoid liability under &sect; 21a-278(b) by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was drug-dependent at the time of the offense. Second, the court concluded that the issue of drug dependency was not a sentencing factor, but was more akin to an affirmative defense. Thus, the court held that the defense of drug dependency did not require a bifurcated hearing. Third, the court held that a defendant's voluntary decision to maintain mutually inconsistent defenses did not result in a due process violation that required separate trials. Finally, the court held that the jury charge as a whole did not mislead the jury.</SPAN></P>

Despite defendant's contention, the court found that the trial court did not err in failing to inform of a potential conflict of interest in the joint representation because the issue was not raised at trial, defendant did not establish a clear constitutional violation, and the trial court was not required to inquire into a possible conflict.

The court reversed the conviction on the ground that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to ask defendant questions requiring defendant to assume that he was guilty. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant access to a witness's psychiatric records when the trial court had performed an in camera inspection of the records and determined that the records did not contain probative information. The court also ruled that the trial court did not improperly refuse to ask the witness to allow defendant access to the records.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that defendant's statement regarding him having been drinking beer at a club for approximately six hours was admissible. The court ruled that the statement, given after the Miranda warnings, was not tainted by the alleged illegal first confession during defendant's arrest. The court found that the initial first statement had been given voluntarily while in custody and without the Miranda warnings, and such statements did not automatically required the exclusion of other statements made after the Miranda warnings had been given. The court found that the actions and words of defendant were sufficient to allow the superior court to infer a waiver of his Miranda rights. The court held that Conn. Gen.

The court held that because defendant was also arrested for disregarding the signal of a police officer, which was not punishable by mail, the arrest was proper. In affirming the conviction, the court held that because defendant was lawfully arrested and detained at the scene, his vehicle could be searched.

On appeal, the court held that a direct communication from a defendant to his victim was not required to establish a violation of that provision. Section 53a-183(a)(2) provided that a person was guilty of harassment in the second degree when, with the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another, he communicated with a person by mail in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm. Thus, the plain language of the statute did not require a direct communication with the person targeted for harassment. Moreover, courts were not permitted to read into a statute provisions that were not clearly stated or to render its words and phrases mere surplusage. Therefore, the court concluded that a direct communication was not required under &sect; 53a-183(a)(2).</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action because he was adversely affected by the regulation. The fact that plaintiff owned subdividable property, which was clearly within the purview of the zoning regulation, coupled with his legislative attack on the regulation, based primarily on constitutional vagueness grounds, constituted sufficient grounds to seek declaratory relief. Defendant was not prejudiced by plaintiff's failure to allege that the disputed regulation caused plaintiff to be uncertain as to his rights as an owner of potentially subdividable property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with third degree sexual assault, assault of a peace officer, attempt to commit first degree assault, first degree reckless endangerment, and risk of injury to a child. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut) held him guilty of peace officer assault, sexual assault and risk of injury. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The only remaining claim in the appeal was defendant's claim that the superior court improperly instructed the jury on the crime of risk of injury to a child. The court was not persuaded that the instructions as to the crime were improper. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the superior court, which correctly set forth the elements of the crime, and which had not expanded the information by instructing the jury on a statutory or factual alternative not charged in the information. Therefore, an unconstitutional enlargement was not in issue. The instruction was not a kind that the court considered in the context of the test for enlargement to determine whether a constitutional violation existed that clearly deprived defendant of a fair trial. The court concluded that the court's jury instructions, when examined as a whole and in the context of the entire trial, achieved their purpose of assisting the jury in applying the law. The court also concluded that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the instructions and that no injustice to defendant resulted by reason of the instructions. Therefore, no due process violation existed under the constitution.</SPAN></P>
