<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of the crime of murder in the second degree, as a result of the death of his former wife. The jury fixed his punishment at life imprisonment. Defendant appealed from the judgment entered by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) upon the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment convicting him of murder in the second degree. The court either rejected or declined to review the issues raised and affirmed the judgment. Defendant claimed in part that the State failed to make a submissible case, as it failed to show that the victim died as a result of defendant's criminal agency. The court found sufficient circumstantial evidence to require submission of the case to the jury and that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find that the victim was killed by drowning by the criminal agency of defendant. The victim was found in a cold shower with the drain stopped by a washcloth right after defendant, who was banned from the residence, was seen leaving. Additionally, the parties had just been divorced and there was evidence of animosity. The court also held that evidence of the disappearance of the victim's mother on the same day was not improperly admitted. When leaving the house, defendant was seen carrying a large, heavy barrel, and there was evidence that the mother had just been there. The mother's disappearance was part of a continuous occurrence intimately connected with the murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff homeowners' association brought an action to enjoin defendant homeowners from maintaining a kennel-storage shed on a lot owned by them. The Circuit Court of Clay County, Missouri, sustained the homeowners' motion to dismiss the action, as it was barred by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.095 (1969). The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowners maintained a lot in a large estate that was subject to a declaration of restrictions. A homeowners' association was organized for the purpose of enforcing the building restrictions. Under the restrictions, no outbuilding was permitted on any lot in the district. In 1966, a dog kennel was constructed on a lot later purchased by the homeowners. They claimed their liability for breach of the restriction was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.095 (1969). The court agreed. Section 516.095 provided that no action for breach of a covenant restricting use of land could be commenced after two years from the time the right of action accrued. As the court considered matters outside the pleadings, under Mo. R. Sup. Ct. 55.27(a), the motion to dismiss was treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Mo. R. Sup. Ct. 74.04.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An accomplice testified that he and defendants cultivated marijuana plants at three locations. Police seized about 1000 young plants at the location that was the subject of defendants' convictions. In affirming the convictions, the court first held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.020 (1969) of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act prohibited the growing of marijuana and by reference to was not void for vagueness. The court next held that defendants failed to prove that the cultivation met the personal use exception, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.010(19) (1969) under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.180 (1969), which in any event applied only to preparation and compounding, not cultivation. The court then held that the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's erroneous instruction, and held that the evidence that defendant's tilled the soil and planted the seeds was sufficient to prove that they cultivated the marijuana. The court also held that defendants' awareness of the character of the seeds was inferable from their possession or planting of the seeds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former husband sought review from the judgment the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which refused to quash a writ of execution whereby respondent former wife sought to collect child support awarded to her in a divorce proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband discontinued child support payments for his eldest daughter when she reached 18 years of age. The husband contended that the child support obligation ceased because she reached the age of majority and was emancipated. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court correctly refused to quash the writ of execution. The court found that the husband pointed to no statute, and the court found none, which purported to change the common law obligation of a parent to support a minor child until she reached 21 years of age. No statute was found that abrogated the court's authority in a dissolution of marriage proceeding to award child support to the custodial spouse until the child reached 21 years of age. Further, the husband did not been his burden of proof to establish his daughter's emancipation. While the daughter graduated from high school and attended an in-state university, there was no express emancipation by her mother, and the evidence did not establish an emancipation by implication. There was no particular significance to the fact that the mother did not contribute regularly to her daughter's maintenance while she was in college.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was a 13-year-old male employee of defendant. On appeal, defendant contended that the sodomy statute then in effect was facially unconstitutional because it violated the right to privacy. The court found, however, that the right to privacy did not extend to the factual situation presented because marriage and adult status were completely lacking. The court found that consent was also not an aid to defendant because of the victim's age. Because defendant's conduct was not covered by any protected right to privacy, the court concluded that he had no standing to challenge the statute. Next, the court found, contrary to defendant's contentions, that the information was sufficient because it charged the commission of the crime proscribed. Evidence of prior sexual incidents was admissible to show the probability that the specific acts charged were committed and to show the relationship of the parties involved. The State's evidence clearly established two separate and distinct offenses such that conviction of the two offenses, which were committed at different times and places, did not violate double jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>

The penalty provision of the information was dismissed, and the charge was revised to read murder in the first degree with the corresponding penalty provision was to be governed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.011 (1975). Defendant was convicted of second degree murder and received a 55-year sentence. The gun that defendant used in his work as a security officer at a hospital discharged and struck and killed one of two women that he was in a vehicle with. The victim was found lying in a prone position, nude from the waist up, and wearing slacks which had been torn. Defendant fled the scene allegedly to avoid the gunfire when the police fired warning shots and proceeded to the railroad tracks. Defendant appealed. The court upheld denial of defendant's challenge based on the savings clause in the capital murder statutes. The trial court not allowing defendant to present character witnesses was held to be no abuse of discretion given this trial strategy had been abandoned by defense counsel and discovery rules had not been complied with. Defendant also declined to make an offer of proof. The trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue on appeal related to the vexing problem of state court jurisdiction preemption from the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 157 and 158. Plaintiff petitioned the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) to recover damages because of defendant's alleged violation of the Missouri Service Letter Statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.140. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss due to federal preemption, which the circuit court sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff argued this case had not come within the rules relating to federal preemption, as the activity sought to have been regulated by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.140 was the issuance of a service letter, which was a matter distinct from the act of terminating employment, and that the service letter statute had not regulated labor disputes or any other practices protected or prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act. Defendant argued that the basic issue was the real reason for plaintiff's discharge, because it argued plaintiff could not have recovered in the state court action except by showing that the true reason for discharge was his union activity, and that this presented exactly the type of potential conflict that the preemption doctrine was designed to prevent. However, that debate was of only theoretical interest as far as disposition of the case was concerned, for even assuming defendant's argument was correct and that the case fell within the general scope of the preemption concept, the situation here was then immediately released from preemption, as it fell within the well-recognized direct interest for present purposes exception to the preemption general rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified and affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that the petitions of the property owner and city should have been dismissed for lack of authority to appeal the supervisor's determination. The court determined that the property owner was without special interest to contest the supervisor's authority under the Administrative Procedure and Review Act. The court found that depreciation to the property owner's residence as a result of the issuance of the liquor licenses was not sufficient to make the property owner a party in substance to the license proceedings. Thus, the property owner was without status for review by common law writ of certiorari. The court ruled that the city did not have status for judicial review under the Administrative Procedure and Review Act and was not a party in substance to the administrative proceedings for purposes of maintaining a common law writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State Highway Commission sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which invalidated respondent city's contract with appellant because allegedly respondent had been forced to enter the contract as a result of appellant's policy and the contract had been ultra vires in that it had violated Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26(a) (1945).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State Highway Commission's policy required cities to pay part of the costs for right-of-way acquisitions. Consequently, respondent city was required to incorporate the policy into its agreement with appellant before appellant would construct a highway. Thereafter, respondent breached the contract, and appellant brought an action. In defense, respondent claimed that it had been forced to enter the contract as a result of appellant's policy and that the contract had been ultra vires in that it had violated Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26(a) (1945). When the contract was invalidated, review was sought, and the court affirmed and reversed. In affirming, the court held that appellant had exceeded its powers in establishing the policy because there had been no express or implied provisions permitting an exaction of funds for right-of-way acquisitions. Because the contract had required compliance with an invalid policy, the court held respondent had entered it under duress, and thus, the contract was unenforceable. In reversing the ultra vires holding, the court held art. VI, &sect; 26(a) had not been violated because the right-of-way costs had not exceeded respondent's government expenses.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that challenges to the composition of the petit jury array were subject to the rule of preclusion by failure to object timely, at least where the information indicating discriminatory selection was available, as a practical matter, at the time of trial. The court found that it had no record before it, and no method of determining what, if any objection, was presented at the time of trial. The court rejected petitioner's argument that his second conviction violated the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. The court held that petitioner's first conviction was set aside because of trial error and that retrial to correct such a trial error did not constitute double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Defendant and several other people lured the victim to a home where defendant was a houseguest and then engaged in two days of torture of the victim. Police came in response to a phone call reporting the dead body. The officers were let in by a small child and found the corpse. The officers then commenced a warrantless search of the premises, finding evidence that was used against defendant at trial. Following her conviction, defendant sought review of the trial court's decision to admit the evidence. On appeal, the court held that the circumstances did not justify the officers' search of the premises. Although the exigent circumstances exception justified the original entry into the home, the court found that the subsequent concerted search lasting several hours, conducted after it was clear that there was no reason to believe that any evidence would be lost, destroyed, or removed before a search warrant could be obtained, was improper. The court also found that defendant had sufficient privacy interest in the home to have standing to challenge the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant was convicted by a jury of two counts of armed robbery. The trial court sentenced him under the Second Offender Act to 27 years on each count and specified that the sentences were to run consecutively. Movant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which dismissed without evidentiary hearing his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion to set aside the sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant based his Rule 27.26 motion upon the contention that the consecutive sentences were imposed pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969), which was declared unconstitutional by the state supreme court. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the record did not indicate that the trial court relied upon &sect; 546.480 in imposing the sentences. Although the trial court during sentencing stated that it was taking into account the circumstances surrounding the facts in the case, it was not clear whether the statement was directed specifically to the length of sentence or the consecutive nature of the sentence, and it appeared to be directed to both. The court found that the record on both the original trial and the Rule 27.26 motion supported the trial court's finding that discretion was exercised at the time of sentencing. Further, since the sentencing judge and the judge who passed on the Rule 27.26 motion were the same person, the court presumed that the trial court, freed of the constraints of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969), reviewed the motion within the proper constitutional framework and in such a situation a remand for resentencing was not constitutionally required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in dismissing the motion to set aside the sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a rural electric company, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Charles County (Missouri), which favored plaintiff, a private investor owned public utility. The public utility brought the action to enjoin the rural electric company from servicing an area that the public utility claimed was too populous to be serviced by the rural electric company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A public utility instituted litigation to enjoin a rural electric company from building, constructing, or in any way extending an electric line into or within a city because the population of the city had increased to more than 1,500 inhabitants. As a result, the city was no longer a &quot;rural area&quot; as defined by statute. Before the legal action, both companies were servicing areas in and around the city. The public utility claimed that population should be determined by such things as voter registration records and a census bureau field survey. The rural electric company claimed the official census was the correct vehicle for determining population. The trial court adopted the rural electric company's argument, and the reviewing court found that the determination was reversible error. The court held that population should be based on the decennial census. Although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.100(1) (1969) did not definitively require the use of the decennial census for this determination, it did make it mandatory to use the decennial census to determine the population of any political subdivision of the state in other matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that favored the public utility company, and it remanded the cause with instructions for the trial court to set aside its earlier judgment and to set aside the injunction that was entered against the rural electric company. The court further ordered the trial court to dismiss the action of the public utility company and enter judgment for the rural electric company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sold LSD to an undercover officer and 11 months later was arrested for selling the LSD. Following a conviction, review was sought. The court held defendant had failed to preserve an objection to the admissibility of testimony because the objections at trial had not been the same as the grounds set forth in a motion for new trial. The court also held the LSD had not been acquired in a search and seizure because the officer, at the time of purchase, had acquired the right to possession of the LSD. Moreover, the court held an alibi discovery rule had not violated due process because the Missouri rules allowed criminal defendants liberal reciprocal discovery rights. Furthermore, the court held defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the discovery rule because defendant had not been prejudiced by the rule. The court also upheld the sufficiency of the LSD evidence even though a quantitative analysis had not been performed because a modicum of LSD had been sufficient for conviction. Finally, the court held improper testimony had not required a mistrial because defendant had failed to request a mistrial and a sua sponte mistrial had not been needed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had been pardoned of seven previous convictions, which were used to invoke the provisions of the Habitual Criminal Act (Act), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 (1959), and to impeach his credibility when he took the stand to testify in his own defense. Defendant argued that a recent decision, which held that if a defendant was pardoned after conviction and that conviction was thereby obliterated, such &quot;obliterated conviction&quot; could not have been used as the basis for subjecting defendant to the Act if he later committed a criminal offense. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion. The court stated that when a decision overruling previous decisions deals with a rule of procedure then the effect of the subsequent overruling decision was prospective only. Therefore, because the Act was procedural only, it was prospective only. However, the court held that it was still permissible, and certainly not fundamentally unfair to impeach the credibility of a witness by showing pardoned convictions. This form of impeachment was limited to matters concerning the nature and number of the prior offenses; the prosecutor could not go into the details of the prior offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer was charged of neglect of duty for failure to dispatch a patrol car on two separate occasions. The board conducted a hearing on the charge, the officer retired, and then the board found the officer guilty and ordered a loss of pay for 60 days. The officer argued that the penalty constituted a fine in violation of Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 31. The court affirmed. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide an issue of constitutional construction and that the officer failed to preserve the constitutional issue for review. The officer did not attack the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84.170(2) (1969), which authorized the board to impose forfeiture of pay for violations of the rules and regulations of the board. The court held that the officer's retirement did not divest the board of jurisdiction to render a decision because the board was a quasi-judicial body and its jurisdiction could not be divested by a subsequent event over which the officer had control. The court found that based on tapes of calls, there was sufficient evidence to find that the officer failed to dispatch police cars on two separate occasions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cities entered into a contract providing for the supplier to erect waterworks within the recipient's city limits to supply water to both cities. The supplier agreed to furnish water to the recipient's inhabitants at the same rates that it charged its own inhabitants. Over 70 years later, the supplier set a water rate for nonresidents higher than that to be charged residents. The recipient protested. The Missouri Public Service Commission stated that it had no jurisdiction over the regulation of water rates charged by a city to nonresidents, but agreed to take jurisdiction if the supplier so requested. The recipient challenged the legality of the increase and sought to compel the supplier to request the commission's jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the recipient's claims. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the commission did not have jurisdiction, even with the supplier's consent. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.250(7) (1969) did not confer power on the commission to regulate municipal utility rates, even as to water sold beyond city limits. Under Mo. Rev.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Specifically, the court held that although the procedures used by the police were less than exemplary, the identifying witness had a sufficient independent basis of identification of defendant where the witness viewed defendant during the robbery for several minutes in a well-lighted room, the time between the robbery and identification was slightly longer than one hour, and the witness was certain as to his identification. Furthermore, the court found that defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the operation of the Missouri jury selection provision which excused women from service upon request because the jury finally sworn in defendant's case was comprised of 11 women and one man.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction, by the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), for burglary, second degree, contending that he was deprived of a fair trial by exclusion of blacks from the petit jury; that the information contained no allegation that he entered the building with the intent to steal; that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for acquittal; and that the State deliberately suppressed evidence from the crime scene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because defendant failed to file a motion for new trial within the mandatory time period of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.20(a), his constitutional and sufficiency of evidence claims were preserved for review only under the plain error doctrine; his claim as to the sufficiency of the information was reviewed under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 28.02. In affirming the judgment, the court held that defendant did not allege or prove that the State systematically used its peremptory challenges to exclude all blacks from the petit jury and thus failed to raise a justiciable constitutional issue. It also held that although the information may have been poorly drafted, it stated the essential facts of the offense and adequately notified defendant of the charge; further, the evidence that defendant was found inside the building, which had been accessed by a hole carved in the wall, that the safe showed fresh pry marks, and that there were tools in its vicinity, was adequate to support the verdict. The court held that where defendant offered no proof that the State suppressed fingerprints or photographs or that he requested their disclosure, he failed to raise an issue of unconstitutional suppression of evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant owned a single-family residence. Respondent issued a policy of fire insurance to appellant. Appellant's property was partially destroyed by fire. Shortly after, the local building commissioner advised appellant that the building would have to be torn down pursuant to a municipal ordinance. The building was torn down, and appellant made a demand upon respondent for the face value of the policy. Respondent offered appellant the estimated cost, less depreciation, to repair and replace the building. Appellant agreed and withdrew all claims against respondent except for the difference between the amount paid and the face amount of the policy. The trial court found for respondent, noting that the parties stipulated the building was partially damaged and that the prohibition against repair was based upon the building's status as a nonconforming use. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that appellant sustained a total loss and was, therefore, entitled to recover the full value, less depreciation, of the insurance policy and the exclusionary provision of the policy contract was contrary to the valued policy statute and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners filed an action for declaratory judgment against the city and redevelopment corporation to contest the validity and enjoin the enforcement of two ordinances, passed pursuant to the Urban Redevelopment Corporations Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 353 (1969), which designated certain property as blighted and approved a redevelopment plan for the area. The trial court dismissed the property owners' complaint for lack of standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Upon appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the action by the city and redevelopment company would have had a sufficiently adverse effect on the property owners' property interests to give the owners standing to challenge the ordinance approving the redevelopment plan. The property owners would also have had standing to challenge the ordinance declaring the area blighted because such a declaration was one of the prerequisites to the commencement of redevelopment work. The court found that the owners established that the ordinances could have been erroneous, arbitrary and unreasonable and they therefore stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a federal prisoner and was charged in state court with assaulting a police officer, and then transferred back to the federal prison. He requested a speedy trial on the state charges and was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Massage activities involving sexual touching would be prohibited by the ordinance, and violation of the ordinance could result in civil prosecution of appellants and their employees. The massage parlors admitted that they engaged in the practice of giving massages at the request of the client, which would result in consensual touching of a person's anus or genitals and specifically would be prohibited under the ordinance. The massage parlors argued that the trial court erred in declaring the ordinance constitutional because the county failed to meet its burden of demonstrating a compelling state interest as justification for the ordinance. On appeal, the court held that the proper test was according to the standard applicable to the exercise of police power and that the test of the validity of an exercise of police power was reasonableness. The court held that whatever may be said of the right of consenting adults to engage in private sexual massage activities, the issue was the commercialization of such activities. The court affirmed, finding the ordinance within the appropriate exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An original information charged movant with capital murder, but an amended information then reduced the charge to murder in the second degree. Movant pleaded guilty to the reduced charge and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He then brought a Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 motion to set aside the judgment and sentence. After an evidentiary hearing, the Circuit Court of Jasper County (Missouri) denied the motion, from which movant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant alleged entitlement to relief because of attorney inadequacy, in that counsel failed to inform the sentencing judge of mitigating circumstances, failed to apply for change of venue, and failed to advise movant that a life sentence was a substantial possibility. Because the judgment and sentence were based on a guilty plea, the issue of counsel's adequacy was material only to the extent that it bore on the voluntariness and understanding of the plea. The court held that each mitigating circumstance to which movant alluded was brought to the sentencing judge's attention. As for the second point, the decision not to apply for a venue change was a strategic one, based on the fact that counsel hoped to get some racially prejudiced people on the jury. The strategic decision did not amount to ineffective representation. The third point was meritless, as counsel informed movant of the statutory punishment range and told him that a life sentence was within the realm of possibility. The advice was accurate and not rendered inadequate by counsel's failure to characterize, by mathematical odds or appropriate adjectives, the likelihood of the actual sentence. The judgment was upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Joinder of offenses was allowed pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.04 where the offenses were based on the same act or on two or more acts that were part of the same transaction or on two or more acts or transactions that constituted parts of a common scheme or plan. The court found that although the State had assured the trial court that evidence would be produced that would establish that the two crimes had arisen out of the same transaction, the State had actually not presented any evidence of a nexus between the two crimes that would put them within the provisions of Rule 24.04. According to the court, the crimes appeared to be independent transactions unrelated to each other and not the product of a single or continuing motive. For this reason, the court ordered a reversal and a remand. The court rejected the contention that Rule 24.04 was substantive rather than procedural and thereby unconstitutional because of lack of legislative action. The court determined that the argument that the neutron-activation analysis admitted at trial was maculated and therefore inadmissible had not been preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

His objections were overruled, he was convicted, and he appealed. On appeal, his conviction was affirmed, with the court finding his claims either waived or lacking in merit. The court found waived defendant's challenge to the denial of his suppression motion due to his failure to present a full transcript of the suppression hearing, and his constitutional challenges to the statute and indictment under which he was prosecuted due to his failure to present those grounds earlier. The court also held, as to the remaining claims, that the prosecution had established that the drugs were Schedule II drugs, that there was no prejudice arising from the trial judge's erroneous instruction to the jury referring to the drugs being &quot;dispensed&quot; rather than &quot;delivered,&quot; and that the prosecutor's cross-examination was not improper.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that he pled guilty for fear of consecutive sentences that were previously mandated under a statute that was declared unconstitutional. Defendant also contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to file a motion for a psychiatric examination, along with other contentions. The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed, holding that if a defendant's decision to plead guilty was influenced by a statute, involuntariness was not necessarily proven. Defense counsel had a duty to advise a client of the range of punishment and the likelihood of the sentence to be imposed.

The court reversed the judgment. It reasoned that the statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 527.150 (1969), relating to suits to quiet title, was remedial and was to be liberally construed. It held that plaintiff's petition contained all the elements of an action to quiet title under where it alleged plaintiff's fee simple title, the claims of defendants, and averred with particularity how the claims of title were derived. There were issues as to the deed descriptions and surveys and as to the intention of plaintiff as grantor. The court concluded that plaintiff's petition stated a cause of action, that he could have proved that he reserved to himself title to the accretions, and that he was entitled to an adjudication of his title and interest that could not have been made upon the pleadings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former police officer commenced an action for reinstatement and backpay after he was discharged from his job. The officer sought review of a judgment entered in favor of respondents, the police chief, the police commissioner, and members of a village board of trustees, in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer argued that the trial court erred in finding in favor of respondents because the evidence showed that: (1) he had not been fired for cause, contrary to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 80.420 (1969), and (2) respondents' action in discharging him was unlawful, arbitrary, and contrary to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150(1) (1969). The court found that there could be no judicial review of the discharge of an employee at will. The officer was an employee &quot;at-will&quot; because there were no statutes, ordinances, regulations, or an employment contract which gave him, as a village policeman, tenure of employment or restricted discharge in any way, except Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 80.420 (1969). Section 80.420, by which the board could appoint and remove officers, created an exception from the at-will status whenever a policeman was &quot;instantly removed.&quot; Such a summary and extraordinary action was preconditioned upon wanton neglect of duty. The court found that the officer was not &quot;instantly removed,&quot; but simply discharged because there was no charge of wanton neglect of duty. Therefore, the trial court properly entered a judgment in favor of respondents.</SPAN></P>

Movant then sought relief by habeas corpus in the United States District Court, which denied relief. The United States District Court of Appeals concluded that the Missouri courts had not considered, or had inadequately considered, whether the alleged incompetency of movant's trial counsel, if such existed, served to unconstitutionally enhance movant's sentence. The trial court denied movant's second Rule 27.26 motion, finding no basis on which to believe that the jury would have assessed a lesser punishment if the evidence of the uncounseled misdemeanor conviction had not been in the case. The court dismissed movant's appeal because the issue stated in the second motion, although a new ground for relief, could have been raised in movant's prior motion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction of the Circuit Court of Lafayette County (Missouri). The original information jointly charged him with two other defendants. Upon his motion, he was granted a severance and a change of venue. After a jury trial, he was found guilty under a three-count information of robbery in the first degree and assault with intent to kill with malice aforethought. His suppression motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdicts on the assault charges. Three black men had robbed a bank, while a fourth man remained at the bank's entrance. Two of the men were armed. None were masked. Yet, no one could identify defendant as one of the robbers. The four men fled the scene while firing at police. Defendant was arrested within minutes of the robbery. Evidence linking him to the crime included his credit cards, clothing, ammunition found in his jacket, and a pillowcase containing a large sum of money, all of which were found in the getaway car. The court affirmed the judgment of defendant's conviction. The State showed that the men in flight had abandoned the car. It was reasonable to infer that defendant fled the car and left his effects behind. Further, the law presumed malice and intent as a concomitant of an unlawful assault with a deadly weapon. Some forethought also was implicit where the robbers fled and fired at the officers. Where the jury found defendant guilty of participating in the robbery, the record also supported an inference and finding of guilt as to the assaults by gunfire on the officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband commenced an action by publication against the wife for dissolution of marriage, disposition of the marital property, and custody of a child. The wife made no answer and the cause went by default. The circuit court found the marriage irretrievably broken and ordered dissolution and custody of the infant to the father but considered that, in the absence of personal service on the wife, it was without jurisdiction to divide the marital property. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The circuit had jurisdiction to affect the wife's title to the marital property once the res was brought within the control of the court. The husband accomplished this by complying with Mo. R. Civ. P. 54.17, which governed service by publication. The acquisition of the real estate within Missouri by the marriage was a purposeful avail by the spouses of the protection of the state of their interests in the property. However, the circuit court had no jurisdiction over the couple's personal property because the notice of publication described only the real property, and not the personal property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) of murder in the second degree. Defendant alleged errors in the trial court's application of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.020(4) claiming he was entitled to a second psychiatric examination at state expense, and that if the trial court acted properly there was error because &sect; 552.020(4) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's counsel filed a pretrial motion for a psychiatric examination. The examination showed that defendant was not suffering from a mental disease or defect and had the capacity to understand the proceedings and to assist in his own defense. Defendant's counsel filed an objection to the findings and requested a second examination to be done at the state's expense because defendant was without funds to employ the services of a psychiatrist. The court affirmed the judgment. Defendant could not obtain a second examination without cost to him. Section 552.020(4) explicitly provided that a second psychiatric examination was to be made by a physician chosen by and paid for by the party that made the request. The equal protection clause did not require absolute equality or equal advantages, nor did it require the state to equalize economic conditions. Because &sect; 552.020(4) provided for one free and objective examination at state expense, there was no unconstitutional and invidious discrimination based on wealth. That defendant was dissatisfied with the result of the first examination did not, without more, require the state to pay for a second examination.</SPAN></P>

Three witnesses, who were present during the second robbery, also identified defendant as the perpetrator and the license number of the getaway car was traced to defendant. After defendant was arrested, the police observed articles of clothing in his car that matched the description of the robber. A warrantless search of the car revealed two revolvers. The court affirmed. The trial court properly imposed consecutive sentences on defendant because the trial court defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses involved. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion for an evidentiary hearing on the admissibility of the results of a polygraph test because the results of the test were not admissible as they lacked scientific reliability. The court held that the search of the car was valid under the Fourth Amendment because the police had probable cause to believe that the car contained instrumentalities of the crime.

The trial court refused the defense request for an instruction on the effect of intoxication on guilt or innocence of intent. Defendant was convicted. The court affirmed finding that voluntary intoxication was not a defense to a criminal charge and a jury cannot consider such intoxication on the issue of specific intent. The court held that it could not consider some of the issues raised by defendant because they were constitutional issues. The court held because these issues were not presented to the trial court, they were not preserved for review and thus the court could not transfer the case to the Supreme Court for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that the giving on an instruction for murder in the second degree and one on manslaughter did not place the burden on defendant of reducing the charge from murder to manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

When the officials refused to divulge the results of the test, the trial judge ordered the officials to comply with the subpoena and to produce the results of the test and the report. The court issued a preliminary rule in prohibition and made the preliminary rule permanent, holding that: (1) the report and test results were not public records and the public did not have a right to inspect such records because the plain language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 58.449 restricted the use of the report and test results required under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 58.445 to statistical purposes and there was no conflict with Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administratrix contended that the trial court erred in dismissing her petition because the administratrix of a deceased police officer's estate might have maintained her action under Mo.

The court stated that there were no facts stated in the administratrix's petition from which it could be inferred that the decedent had any tenure in his employment or that he could be discharged only for cause. The administratrix pleaded no contract of employment, or ordinance to that effect. There was no statute giving him tenure or providing that he could be discharged only for cause. The decedent was employed at will. He had no property interest in his employment. The determination of the adequacy of the grounds for his discharge was not subject to judicial review because the city could discharge him for no reason or for any reason. The only formal requisite for the discharge was that the mayor discharged the decedent with the consent of the majority of all of the members of the board or by a vote of two-thirds of all of the board.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner was an incorporated youth organization.

The trial court granted a preliminary writ, but dissolved the writ following a hearing. On appeal, the court held that the conclusory statements of various witnesses regarding the bad condition of the buildings were insufficient to support a finding that the buildings were in such a state of disrepair as to make rehabilitation impracticable. The court reasoned that the standards of impracticability required a consideration from both an economic and a technological standpoint.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that: (1) there was sufficient evidence to support a denial of bail to defendant, who was considered dangerous, and there was no showing that defendant suffered any prejudice as a result; (2) the joinder of the two offenses was proper because the offenses were based on the same act or on two or more acts which were part of the same transaction; (3) defendant failed to include all exhibits whose admission was alleged to be error, and the photographs that were introduced could not be considered on appellate review; and (4) the narcotics evidence was admissible because defendant's drug use and sales were inextricably linked to the motive for the kidnappings and murders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the school board furloughed probationary teachers due to a financial crisis, the teachers sought a temporary injunction prohibiting the school board's action. Both parties agreed to submit the entire case on the merits to the trial court. On review, the teachers contended that the school board's action went beyond its authority under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.124, and that the action was unlawful, arbitrary and capricious. Treating the matter as a final appealable order, the court affirmed denial of the injunction and dismissal of the case. The court held that the language in the statute permitting the law-off of &quot;as many teachers as may be necessary&quot; reasonably contemplated that both permanent and temporary teachers would be laid off. Further, the court found that under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 100.08(a), the trial court did not substitute its discretion for that of the school board, and that based on the record, the teachers did not sustain their burden of demonstrating that the school board acted other than properly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant broke a window in a pickup truck belonging to a motor company, hooked the truck by a log chain onto the bumper of his car, directed his companion to steer the truck, and drove his car along the highway with the truck in tow at a high rate of speed. The log chain became unhooked and the pickup truck collided with another vehicle, killing four people. On appeal, movant contended that he was denied equal protection and due process of law because his companion was charged with, and convicted of, manslaughter rather than second-degree murder. The court affirmed. The companion was charged with second-degree murder; furthermore, whether the companion was convicted of manslaughter or exonerated was immaterial to movant's guilt. Movant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel. The trial court did not fail to make proper findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26(i) before denying the motion without an evidentiary hearing. The court vacated movant's consecutive sentences because the trial court did not exercise discretion in determining movant's sentence as permitted after Mo. Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 209.010 (1969) gave the division the authority to set reasonable standards for usual essential expenses. The amount of the standard was just over the median amount budgeted for medical expenses in a study of a number of sample cases, and the adequacy of the amount had to be viewed in light of the benefits available under the Medicaid program for the disabled under Mo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri). After two of defendant's four convictions had been set aside on direct appeal, defendant was resentenced to 50 years for rape and 10 years for kidnapping. The trial court overruled defendant's motion for postconviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 without an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions for two additional counts were set aside on the basis that filing an amended information on the day of trial was plain error. Defendant sought postconviction relief, arguing in part that undergoing a trial on the four counts was so oppressive as to deny due process. The court upheld the denial of relief. Defendant had not alleged any facts showing how joinder of the counts was oppressive. The facts that defendant had alleged simply recapitulated his argument on direct appeal, where two of the convictions had been overturned. Thus, any claim of constitutional error with respect to those two counts was moot. As to the counts for which his convictions were upheld, defendant had received a preliminary hearing. Moreover, being tried on a multiple count information, where some of the counts were later held invalid, did not make the trial oppressive simply because evidence of other crimes had been placed before the jury. Evidence of other crimes could be introduced into evidence under certain circumstances as, for example, when a common scheme embracing the commission of two or more crimes was so related that proof of one tended to establish the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a combined postconviction relief motion attacking three convictions for assault and a separate conviction of murder. The trial court sentenced him to consecutive 25, 10, and 10 year sentences under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969). Defendant filed a pro se motion for postconviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26. The causes were severed, and the motion related to the assault charges was denied without evidentiary hearing. Defendant received appointed counsel on the murder charge 97 days before the post-conviction relief on his murder conviction. Although defendant failed to challenge the validity of the consecutive sentences, the hearing court sua sponte considered them and ruled against defendant. On appeal, the court held that the hearing judge, who had been the trial judge, stated that although defendant had been sentenced under the now invalid statute, had the trial court been free at the time of sentencing to exercise its discretion, the sentences would have nevertheless been made consecutive. Because defendant three months to consult with counsel after sentencing and move for a new trial, he was not denied effective assistance under R. 26.27(h).</SPAN></P>

Noting that defendant objected promptly to each improper comment the court held that defense counsel was not required to anticipate the cumulative effect of prejudicial comments yet to be made. Nevertheless the court held that the comments, which related to matters not in evidence or were inappropriate characterizations of the evidence, cured as they were by admonishment, were not so prejudicial in sum to require declaration of a mistrial. The court vacated the sentences and remanded for resentencing because it did not appear whether the consecutive sentences were imposed in the trial court's discretion or in observance of the unconstitutional mandatory consecutive sentencing law, Mo.

Plaintiffs alleged that they had the right of way because they were following a funeral procession. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that neither party had fully set out the ordinance that was in question. The court concluded plaintiffs' injury and damage were not of the character the ordinance was designed to prevent. The court noted that plaintiffs principally complained that a charge to the jury ignored plaintiffs' right to have been in the intersection as a participant in the funeral procession. The court concluded that funeral procession did not have the right to an unqualified right of way at signal controlled intersections. The court found that the jury had resolved the issue of who had the green light at the intersection, and the court was not going to disturb the jury's findings. Finally, the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a new trial because the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to grant plaintiffs' motion on the ground that defendant's version of the facts was inherently impossible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A mother, a Missouri resident, died in an automobile accident in Iowa; the uninsured driver resided in Iowa. Plaintiffs, guardians of the mother's child, sued defendant insurer for coverage under the uninsured motorist provision in the mother's policy. The parties stipulated that the driver acted negligently, not recklessly. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, holding that the Iowa guest statute,&nbsp;Iowa Code &sect; 321.494, barred recovery. On appeal, the court affirmed. Plaintiffs did not show that the uninsured driver would be liable for the death of the mother. The court used the &quot;most significant relationship&quot; test to determine that Iowa law, rather than Missouri law, applied because the mother's Missouri residence did not outweigh the various Iowa contacts. Section 321.494 prevented recovery because the driver did not act recklessly or wantonly as required for plaintiffs to prevail.</SPAN></P>

The appeal was defendant's second, and the trial was his third. On defendant's first appeal he was awarded a second trial, which ended in a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction arose out of an incident in which defendant and two other individuals allegedly robbed a residence where an acquaintance was babysitting.

Although defendant was convicted of both assault and robbery at his first trial, the prosecution chose to nolle prosequi the assault count at the end of the evidence at defendant's third trial. The court held that: 1) the trial court did not err in failing to declare a mistrial when the prosecution entered a nolle prosequi as to the assault count, 2) that the trial court did not err in permitting another individual who had been convicted for the robbery to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege or in permitting his transcript testimony to be read to the jury, 3) that there was no error in the trial court's failure to sustain a motion for judgment of acquittal in defendant's previous two trials, and 4) that the sentence imposed under the Second Offender Act did not violate the appellant's due process rights because it was no greater than his original sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both respondent ex-wife and appellant ex-husband challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cass County (Missouri) in their dissolution of marriage proceeding. The wife contended that the trial court's purported division of marital property lacked finality and did not constitute a &quot;just&quot; division as contemplated in and commanded by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.330 (Supp. 1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was whether the court had jurisdiction to entertain the cross-appeals. The court determined that if a division of the &quot;marital property&quot; as required by and envisioned in &sect; 452.330 was not precluded on constitutional grounds, then the trial court did not exhaust its jurisdiction and the decree was not a final judgment and was not appealable. In dismissing the action, the court found that the trial court had no discretion or leeway to divide or not divide the &quot;marital property&quot; on a &quot;just&quot; basis, as it was inexorably commanded to do so because &sect; 452.330 provided that it was to divide the marital property in such proportions as the trial court deemed just after considering all relevant factors including those specifically enumerated. The record failed to reveal any economics involved that would justify the trial court's leaving either the real or personal property comprising the &quot;marital property&quot; vested in the parties as tenants in common. Accordingly, the decree entered by the trial court did not constitute a division of &quot;marital property&quot; as contemplated in and mandated by &sect; 452.330, and for that reason was not a final judgment and order and was not appealable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The testator executed his will the day after he was convicted and sentenced to a two year term for arson. The heirs contended that the testator was incapable of making and executing a will as his civil rights were suspended by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 222.010. The court affirmed the judgment, ruling that although the testator was convicted and judgment thereon was entered, he had the legal ability to execute his will while at liberty before incarceration. Therefore, the will was not void by reason of &sect; 222.010. The heirs argued that the trial court erred in denying their motion for a directed verdict because defendants failed to prove testamentary capacity and the attestation of the will. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to submit the issue of testamentary capacity to the jury. Further, the court found that a testator's request that a witness attest did not need to be made by express words but could arise from acts, signs, and conduct. The court found that the element of intent was established by testimony and that a submissible issue was made for the jury.

On appeal, the court pointed out that the Missouri General Assembly created a separate classification, the City's police force, the functions of which were of general State concern, and retained control of that force, including the determination of the compensation to be paid. In contrast, by permitting the people of the City to write their own charter for city government subject to restrictions, the General Assembly delegated to the City the governmental functions of local application. The court held that such classification was permissible under amend. XIV. Nor did the difference in compensation violate the City Charter. Article XVIII, &sect; 2(b) did not purport to require identical compensation, and appellants had not alleged facts that would invalidate the City's discretionary determination of compensation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Criminal Causes, City of St. Louis (Missouri), which convicted him of two counts for the illegal sale of marijuana, a Schedule I Controlled Substance, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.200 (1969). Having a prior controlled substance felony conviction, defendant received the minimum mandatory sentences provided in &sect;195.200(1)(5) on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of pertinent portions of &sect; 195.200. Defendant contended that the 10-year minimum sentence prohibiting parole, probation, suspended sentences or any other form of judicial clemency usurped the judicial function in violation of Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 and art. V, &sect; 1. He also argued that the sentence as excessive and disproportionate, constituting cruel and unusual punishment contrary to the mandate of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 and the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In affirming the conviction, the court held that in Missouri, fixing punishment for a crime defined by statute was the province of the legislature. A trial court only had power to suspend a sentence if there was an express statutory provision that gave it that power. Therefore, there was no usurpation of judicial authority.

The court held that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to exclude the potential juror for cause because during the entire voir dire examination the potential juror expressed great uncertainty with his ability to be impartial given his past association with law enforcement and in view of the fact that the trial judge made no effort to question the juror about his possible prejudice. The court noted that evidence of the retail price of the liquor was properly admitted for the purpose of determining the value under the theft statute.</SPAN></P>

He also challenged his $ 100 fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. The court held that despite the fact that the information, in the form of a traffic ticket, under which he was convicted had language that he unlawfully operated and had physical control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated, such offenses did not charge inconsistent conduct. Further, the ordinance described the offenses disjunctively, and the information was held to be a valid accusation as to both. The court further held that the ordinance was constitutionally valid despite the fact that the ordinance proscribed both the operation and actual physical control of a vehicle by an intoxicated person. Section 564.440 prohibited only the operation of the vehicle as the ordinance under which he was convicted treated physical control as a necessary incident of actual operation of a vehicle and extended the prohibition of the statute to that continuous activity. Thus, there was no conflict between the statute and the ordinance. Finally, the court held that &quot;being in actual physical control,&quot; although not defined by the state, was not vague, as the court adopted the definition used by other states faced with a similar question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition seeking placement of the child alleged that his environment was injurious to his welfare because the marital discord between his parents created an unhealthy emotional environment.

The court held that the constitutional errors, if any, were not preserved because they were not raised below. Marital discord was stated as the cause of the injurious environment; injurious environment was all that was required to be shown under the statute.

In so finding, the jury rejected the tendered insanity defense. Defendant appealed, charging numerous errors including the refusal of testimony from a nondisclosed defense witness, the insanity defense, and failure of the State to disclose a psychologist's test results. The court affirmed because there was no question that the name of a defense witness, defendant's mother, was not disclosed, and defendant's representation of complete disclosure pursuant to the rules and absent written request or motion obviated the necessity of a written request or motion by the State. The court also held that the State disclosed, and defendant was apprised of, the existence of the psychologist's test, and that defendant was prepared to meet the doctor on that issue. Accordingly, defendant was not deprived of the opportunity on that account to prepare for cross-examination of that State's witness. In addition, defendant's assertion that the State had the burden concerning the insanity defense lacked merit.

</DIV>

The court noted that the beginning of the information expressly stated that the movant willfully and feloniously committed the offenses identified in the information. The fact that the word &quot;felonious&quot; was not repeated for each count did not render the information defective. The purpose of the statutorily mandated language was to give notice to movant of the nature of the charge. Because the information clearly did so, movant's claim of error was without merit. The court further found that the trial court's imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent sentences was done purposefully. The court found that there was nothing in the record that suggested that the sentencing judge court acted in a manner demonstrating he felt constrained or prohibited by the statute from exercising his discretion.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court concluded that the trial court effected a just division of the marital property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner father appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which sustained respondent board of education's motion to dismiss the father's action in mandamus for a judicial finding that the father's child be assigned to a new school as being more accessible within the meaning of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.121 (1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the immediately preceding three years, the father had submitted annual applications to enroll his son in a certain school as more accessible under &sect; 167.121. Each year the application were approved. In the fourth year, the application was denied. The father filed an action in mandamus to force the schools to approve the fourth-year application, which the trial court refused. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the father's res judicata argument did not apply because approvals were made in annual steps and at the time of any annual request the board could take into consideration any changes in other basic factors of which it had knowledge or that may have been brought to its attention. The court also held that the board properly took into consideration that the new school would begin providing pupil transportation. The court found that this was reasonable because the difference in the travel distance was minimal, the two schools were located in a metropolitan area serviced by modern, paved streets, the travel time each way did not exceed 15 minutes, there was no difference in the safety factor, and there was no showing of impairment to the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and the two decedents went to defendant's house, where several other people were gathered. An argument broke out between one of the decedents and another guest. Defendant broke up that fight and another altercation. The two decedents then intimated that they had guns and could take care of the whole crowd. Defendant went to retrieve his shotgun. When defendant reappeared, he claimed that both decedents appeared to go for weapons. Defendant opened fire, killing both decedents. No guns were found on the decedents. The court held that a case that declared unconstitutional a statute similar to Missouri's that excused women from jury duty was rendered after defendant's case and did not apply retroactively. Defendant was not entitled to admit the decedents' criminal records. Defendant was allowed to show proof of the decedents' reputations for violence, but criminal convictions did not meet that standard. Since there was no evidence of the decedents' reputations for violence, defendant was not entitled to an instruction concerning the decedents' reputations in the community. Evidence used in the State's case in chief could be used to rebut defendant's claim of self-defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that (1) the legislature had not designated the possession of hashish as being a crime separate from the crime of possession of marihuana, (2) an unlawful search and seizure occurred at the time the drugs were found and seized by police officers, and (3) Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 195 was unconstitutional as applied to defendant in that it denied to him his First Amendment right to freedom of religion. On appeal, the court determined that the schedules in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.017 enumerating prescribed narcotics or drugs listed marihuana and tetrahydrocannabinol, but did not list hashish. The court held, therefore, that the possession of hashish, being marihuana, constituted only the crime of possession of marihuana. The court ruled that since hashish was included in the definition of marihuana, there was no separate crime for the possession of hashish. The court rejected defendant's contention that the search warrant was unlawful, finding that the warrant was proper as the multi-unit character of the building was not externally apparent to the police. The court held that the free exercise of religion did not include the right to violate statutory laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant dog owner appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which awarded plaintiff bite victim damages for personal injuries and property damage caused when the dog owner's dog caused the bite victim's motorcycle to overturn. The dog owner claimed that the municipal ordinance relied on by the victim, that made it unlawful for a dog owner to let a dog run large, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dog owner's dog, which was walking off the owner's premises, unrestrained by a leash, ran into the street grabbed the victim's motorcycle, overturning the cycle and throwing the victim to the pavement. Claiming that allowing the dog to walk unleashed off the owner's premises violated a municipal ordinance that made it unlawful for a dog owner to let his dog &quot;run at large&quot; and was negligence per se, the victim recovered a judgment against the dog owner for personal injuries and property damage. On appeal the dog owner claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Disregarding cases concerning vague criminal statutes relied on by the owner because the ordinance was a remedial statute that imposed a civil duty, the court held that the ordinance's definition of a dog running at large and not under reasonable control clearly applied to the owner's dog and, therefore, the ordinance was definite enough to create a civil duty to keep a dog under control when off the premises of the owner to prevent it from doing injury to persons or damage to property. The owner's other point, that there was no proof he violated the ordinance, was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Buchanan County (Missouri), which convicted him of rape and first- degree robbery in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 559.260 (1969) and 560.135 (1969). Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court committed error by overruling his motion for severance of the rape charge and by denying his counsel the right to argue in summation at a bench trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim discovered a person identified as defendant in her home. He had a knife and demanded money for &quot;dope.&quot; Later he forced her to have sex with him. The court held that the information was not defective. The information stated that he did &quot;ravish&quot; a woman. The word &quot;rape&quot; was not required because &quot;ravish&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.260 (1969) meant more than mere sexual intercourse and carried the implication and meaning of carnal knowledge by force and without consent. &quot;Ravish&quot; was synonymous with &quot;rape.&quot; Defendant did not have either a federal or state constitutional right to be tried on only one offense at a time. Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.04 was a procedural rule which permitted joinder of separate offenses under the conditions therein stated and had no provision relating to sentencing procedures. After defense counsel had renewed his motion for acquittal, the trial judge entered a finding of guilty. The court held that counsel had a right to argue in summation, but in this case failure to permit him to do so was not prejudicial because the evidence was fresh in the judge's mind and the State presented a strong case.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court held that the trial judge properly found probable cause and thus, the officers clearly had the right to seize evidentiary items in plain view. Defendant further alleged that the trial court improperly failed to quash the indictment against him because the state legislature had passed a statutory scheme for the selection of grand jurors that excluded an identifiable class of jurors. The court found defendant's allegation to be without merit because he failed to meet the burden of establishing that the practice the statutory system resulted in any form of discrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Stoddard County, Missouri of two counts of possession of controlled substances in violation of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 195.020 (West Supp. 1973). He was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment for possession of morphine and five years' imprisonment for possession of barbiturates. On appeal, the issues included whether evidence of other crimes was erroneously admitted to his prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Through an informant, police arrested defendant at an apartment. Bottles of liquid drugs and capsules were found in the refrigerator. A forensic chemist testified as to the chemicals found in the liquid and the capsules. At the close of its case in chief, the State was permitted to amend both counts of the information to reflect that testimony. On appeal, the court held that the amendment did not charge defendant with an offense different from that with which he was originally charged. There was no basis for his claim that he was prejudiced by the timing. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting evidence about defendant's other crimes, which consisted solely of quotes of what defendant himself had said. The court held that defendant did not present at trial or in a motion for new trial a claim that his sentence for possession of morphine was excessive, so the court did not consider it. Because there was no proof that defendant was guilty of a lesser or included offense, the trial court was not required to instruct the jury that they might find defendant guilty of that offense. Defendant had not briefed a Fourth Amendment issue, so the court considered it abandoned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">No prejudicial error appeared and the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The buyer delivered to defendant his personal check, made payable to defendant, as earnest money on the contract. Subsequently, the parties completed the real estate purchase with defendant receiving a check representing the balance of the purchase price under the contract. It was the oral agreement and understanding of the sellers and defendant that he would immediately utilize the balance of the buyer's check to retire an outstanding loan on the property. This was also the buyer's understanding of how the matter would be handled with reference to the encumbrance on the farm. Defendant failed to pay off the debt. There was never a sufficient balance in his bank account to cover a check for the amount necessary to retire the loan. Thereafter, defendant was charged with and convicted of stealing. He sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find that defendant stole the money by retaining possession of and using it without the consent of the owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1960, defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary and then pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery, the convictions resulting in concurrent eight-year sentences. While imprisoned, defendant learned that the sentences would run consecutively, because under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 the sentence on the second offense could not be served until the first sentence had ended. On defendant's motion to vacate the sentences, the trial court vacated only the burglary sentence and defendant served the robbery sentence. Then, in 1969, defendant was charged with burglary and stealing, as well as with the 1960 robbery offense as a second offender, but the trial court removed the question of sentencing from the jury. The judgments were affirmed. In filing for a Writ of Error Coram Nobis, defendant argued that, given the consecutive sentence provisions of &sect; 546.480, the failure to vacate the 1960 robbery sentence deprived him of his right to have a jury decide his sentence in the 1969 trial. Disagreeing, the court said defendant had received all the relief he was entitled when one 1960 sentence was vacated, thereby nullifying the statute's effect and eliminating any potential prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court determined that the Commission's action was a proper exercise of its discretion and also on the basis that the Commission's order in the permanent rate case had rendered the interim rate proceeding moot. The court held that the Commission had the power to grant interim rate increases within the broad discretion implied from the Missouri file and suspend statutes and from the practical requirements of utility regulation. The court concluded that although it was theoretically possible, even in a purposefully shortened interim rate hearing, for the evidence to show beyond reasonable debate that the applicant's rate structure had become unjustly low, without any emergency as defined by the Commission having as yet resulted. However, the court held that the utility clearly failed to carry the heavy burden of proof imposed upon it by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.430 to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the determination denying the interim rate increase was unreasonable or unlawful. Accordingly, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant driver sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) that affirmed a decision of respondent director of revenue to revoke the driver's operator's license pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 564.444 (1969). The reason for the revocation of the driver's operator's license was his refusal to submit to a chemical test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver challenged the judgment that affirmed the revocation of his operator's license, and asserted that &sect; 564.444 was unconstitutionally vague, contradictory, and misleading because the warning indicated that he may have his license revoked for failure to take a chemical test, but upon such refusal the revocation by the director was mandatory. The court affirmed, and held that a reading of the statute showed that it did not require a mandatory revocation of the driver's license upon the driver's refusal to submit to a chemical test. The court held that revocation of a driver's operator's license occurred only when an officer believed the driver to have been intoxicated, that upon his arrest he refused to take a chemical test, and the officer subsequently filed was sworn written statement to that effect with the director. The court held that the officer's warning to the driver that the chances were that he would likely loose his operator's license if he refused to take the chemical test was sufficient to apprise the driver of the consequences of his refusal. The court held that the director had no discretion regarding the duration of the suspension of the driver's license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot the victim to death during a holdup. He was arrested, escaped from jail, and was re-arrested. At his trial the court allowed into evidence defendant's detention records from the jail which contained entries concerning his escape. Defendant contended these records lacked the required foundation. The records here were identified by a corrections officer who stated he had custody of the records, that they were kept in the ordinary course of the operation of the jail with entries made at the time events occurred. The court held that this testimony satisfied the requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 490.680. The court also held that it was proper for the trial court to instruct the jury that if they found defendant had escaped to avoid prosecution, they might consider that fact in determining his guilt. The court reversed the sentence, however, holding that the court should not have sentenced defendant under mandatory sentencing provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.480 (1969) because that statute was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Director of Liquor and Amusement Control and the members of the Liquor Control Board of Review of Kansas City, Missouri, challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which reversed a decision of the Board, and which ordered the Director to grant the application of respondent liquor license holder to transfer his liquor license permit from one location to another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Director refused to issue a transfer to the license holder, the Board upheld the Director's decision. As a result, the license holder filed a petition for review under the Administrative Procedure and Review Act, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.100 et seq. (1969). Thereafter, the trial court determined that although Kansas City, Mo., Code of Gen. Ordinances ch. 4, art. X, &sect; 4.61, regarding the discretion of the Director in granting or issuing a license, was applicable to the controversy, the section was unconstitutional and void as a violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and the Fourteenth Amendment. However, on appeal, the court held that the denial of the license holder's application to transfer was lawful under the city ordinance, because based on substantial competent evidence, the ordinance was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Furthermore, the court held that the license holder did not comply with mandatory requirements to invoke constitutional questions. Thus, the trial court should not have ruled on the constitutional issues. Accordingly, the court remanded the case with directions to enter a judgment upholding the Director's denial of the transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff candidate appealed from a decision by the Circuit Court of the County of Franklin (Missouri) that entered a judgment denying the candidate's petition to invalidate an ordinance establishing new ward lines for voting districts in the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city changed the boundary between its two wards and divided the black voters in half by splitting them into a third ward based on the census population. The candidate contended that the reapportioned districts constituted a racially motivated gerrymander and that the ordinance resulted in uneven population distribution between the wards. The court ruled that the candidate had established a prima facie case of racial discrimination. The court held that: (1) the candidate had not sustained his burden of showing racially motivated gerrymander because the original district did not have a substantial black voting strength where black registered voters only made up 10 percent of the district's population; (2) the reapportionment violated the equal protection clause because it diminished the one man-one vote rule which required that the legislative body make a good faith effort to construct districts &quot;as nearly of equal population as practicable&quot;; and (3) use of the census population in this case, versus the registered voter population resulted in a disproportionate number of eligible voters because one voting district had three times the voting power of the other district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and voided the redistricting ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a minor age 15 years and 11 months when he killed a family. The court found that the juvenile court's findings and conclusion to waive jurisdiction did not amount to an abuse of discretion because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.071 entrusted the determination to relinquish jurisdiction to the discretion of the juvenile court. Under the totality of the circumstances the court found that defendant should be dealt with under the general law rather than the juvenile code. Thus, the juvenile system was not the proper forum for the handling of defendant. The court found that the testimony of the police officer that interrogated defendant that he admitted the murders was harmless error because the testimony of the jail inmate that defendant admitted to the killings was admissible. However, if there was a new trial the police officer's testimony should not be introduced. The court reversed the conviction, finding that defendant having adduced evidence that his mental state did not admit to his having deliberated before the shootings required an instruction allowing the jury to consider an instruction on murder in the second degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a clerk in an adult bookstore, appealed his obscenity conviction and $ 300 fine, arguing that Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 563.280 (West 1969) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that the publication he sold was not obscene but protected expression under U.S. Const. amend. I and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. On appeal, the court held the trial court correctly permitted the State to amend the information to change the name of the police officer who purchased the publication from defendant because the information notified defendant that he was being charged with knowingly selling obscenity and specifically identified the allegedly obscene publication. Defendant was not charged with selling obscenity to minors; thus, to whom he sold the publication was not material. The trial court did not err in admitting another publication into evidence because it was not admitted as evidence of a separate offense but to prove defendant's scienter. Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 563.280 (West 1969) was not vague and overbroad because previous judicial construction of its statutory language had become part of the statute, making the statute sufficiently specific to avoid challenge for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant and another were charged with assault with intent to kill with malice. The information also charged movant as a second offender based on a prior conviction for the offense of burglary. Movant was convicted and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Movant filed a motion for postconviction relief. The motion was denied by the trial court. The court affirmed finding that the allegation that the prior conviction was invalid because movant was not represented by counsel when his probation was revoked attacked no finding, judgment, or conclusion of the trial court which heard the motion for postconviction relief and thus did not preserve the matter for review. The court noted that movant made no pretrial, trial, or posttrial objection to the introduction of the prior conviction. The court found that the circumstances sustained a finding that a bypass of the orderly State procedure was made such that movant was precluded from raising the issue in the postconviction proceedings. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.180, specifically defining assault with intent to kill, did not come within the purview of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.150, the attempt statute.</SPAN></P>

Approximately 50 days later he screened the same pornographic film and was cited for contempt, fined, and jailed for one year. In quashing the writ of habeas corpus issued for review, the court held that the trial judge did not err in denying the owner's recusal motion. The court noted that the general rules regarding disqualification or change of venue did not apply to contempt proceedings. The court explained that absent a specific rule or statute, litigants in a contempt proceeding had no right to disqualify a judge. The court held that Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 51.05, 30.12, and 35.01 were inapplicable to contempt proceedings and afforded not basis for the owner to disqualify the judge. The court also held that the owner could not avoid the contempt by now attacking the injunction as constitutionally vague or overbroad. The court held that the injunction, even if erroneous, was to be obeyed while it was in force. The court observed that prior to the contempt citation the owner had made no effort to attack the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The court found the fact that people of different height were in the line-up did not make it impermissibly suggestive, particularly when it was not noticed by the witness. Even if it were suggestive, the court found that the testimony was admissible because there was an independent source for the identification. The witness had seen defendant at close range for several minutes and her description was not inaccurate. In response to defendant's argument that the jury acted improperly, the court held that the jury could not be heard to impeach its own verdict and any proof of the alleged misconduct was far from overwhelming. The court then found that the jury instruction on reasonable doubt had been properly given as it was the instruction that had withstood a multitude of challenges. Finally, the court rejected defendant's challenge to the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim informed the police that she had been driven to appellant's apartment and sexually assaulted by him and his wife. She alleged that appellant and his wife threatened her with a pistol. She described appellant and accompanied the police to his apartment. After the officers arrested appellant they went to a bedroom at the rear of the apartment to place his wife under arrest. As they entered the bedroom, an officer saw a pistol on a dresser. The court affirmed appellant's conviction for forcible rape and sodomy and held that the pistol was not the product of an unlawful search. The search was incident to a lawful arrest. The arresting officers properly looked elsewhere in the apartment for the second participant and properly took the weapon after observing it in plain view. The victim's identification of appellant's automobile was clearly not the product of an illegal search. Because the record did not show if the consecutive sentences were imposed under the compulsion of Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri of stealing over $ 50. The judge found that he had a prior felony offense and sentenced him under the Second Offender Act (Act), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280. On appeal, the issues included the propriety of a jury instruction in two respects, the applicability of the Act, and whether the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find the value of the stolen items.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The value of the items defendant stole from a store, which was part of a chain, was based on a memo prepared by a witness from inventory records correlated to a tag on each item on which tag was a code number from which the store's cost could be determined. Defendant argued that the witness had no personal knowledge of the value, the records were the best evidence, and the testimony was hearsay. On appeal, the court held that the fact that the code numbers were used throughout the chain, the tags were affixed to the stolen items, and the codes were correlated with the inventory records was sufficient to establish that the total value was over $ 50. The court held that there was no error in giving the disputed instruction. Defendant offered no evidence that he intended to deprive the owner of property valued at anything less than $ 50 and any other error was not prejudicial. The instruction required the jury to find all the essential elements of the crime. The court held that the Act was properly applied. A prior felony conviction in another state was shown; that the execution of the sentence was suspended did not affect the Act's application. The Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded custody of the parties' 15-year old daughter to the wife but did not provide for custody of the parties' then-18-year old son. Finally, the trial court divided the marital property and awarded maintenance, child support, and attorney's fees. Both parties appealed and the court affirmed and remanded. The court held that, after careful perusal of the extensive record, the trial court's orders were just. The husband waived his constitutional question as to a new statute that defined and discussed the division of marital property because he joined issue on the question of what marital property was and failed to raise the constitutional question earlier. The wife was properly given an interest in the husband's property acquired as a result of the settlement of his personal injury action because it was acquired by him subsequent to marriage, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.330(2) (1969). A remand was required to determine the question of the son's custody and support until age 21 because S.B.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The film was obscene under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 563.280, 563.285 (1969), as it appealed to the prurient interest, depicted patently offensive acts of sexual intercourse, normal and perverted, excretory functions, and lewd exhibitions of the genitals, which had absolutely no serious literary, artistic, or political value. The court determined that the corporation's proffered evidence of certain books of &quot;comparable&quot; nature was inadmissible, as the issue of obscenity could not be established by comparing one book or film to another. Also, the corporation's stipulation that the &quot;comparables&quot; could be purchased in the area and that sexually explicit films did good business throughout the area was inadmissible, as the court did not considered the proffered books as being comparable to a color film.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with five offenses before the trial court. At the same time he faced other state charges in another circuit court, as well as two federal robbery offenses. Defendant entered a plea of guilty on each of the five offenses, but before sentencing he filed a motion to withdraw the pleas. He alleged that he understood that the cases would be postponed until he was sentenced in the other circuit court and that any sentences would run concurrently with the federal offenses. The trial court denied the motion to withdraw the pleas and ordered that the five convictions run concurrently to each other and to the other circuit case. Defendant appealed on the ground that he was misled because there was no authority to run the sentences concurrently with the other state conviction. The court held that defendant's pleas were voluntary and knowing. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the trial court should nevertheless resentence defendant in its discretion, because Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city's amended ordinance required the payment of an annual license fee for each billboard within city limits with no provisions for inspection or regulation. When the company failed to pay the fee, the city filed an action in municipal court and prevailed. The trial court entered judgment for the company, which had argued that the cost of licensing did not bear a reasonable ratio to the cost of inspection and regulation. The court reversed. It was that true that when a city acted under its police powers in levying a license tax to defray the costs of inspection and regulation, the cost of licensing had to be reasonably proportionate to inspection and regulation costs. However, the ordinance was not a regulatory measure passed in the exercise of the city's police powers. Rather, the city had imposed the amended ordinance under its taxing powers, solely for the purpose of raising revenue, without any provisions for inspection and regulation. Although license fees for revenue purposes had to be reasonable, a fee fixed by ordinance was prima facie reasonable, and the company had not shown the city had abused its power in levying the license tax.</SPAN></P>

Before leaving, defendant told the two employees that they were to be quiet, that he could &quot;still shoot them through the window.&quot; Both men then left and drove off. The court held that an in-court identification testimony was admissible if the State was able to show a basis for this testimony independent of pretrial identification procedures. Here, the witness had ample opportunity to observe defendant while the robbery was taking place. The trial court properly found the liquor store employee's identification testimony was based on what he saw at the time the offense was committed. Also, each case required an individualized sentencing procedure, and if the sentence was severe, no error of constitutional dimension appeared in its imposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Public Service Commission of Missouri sought review of the order of the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, which remanded to the Commission for further proceedings an interim order the Commission had issued with respect to rates to be charged by respondent sewer company. At issue was whether the circuit court had authority to issue a remand order or should have retained the cause and determined it on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sewer company applied to the Commission for approval of a rate increase. After lengthy administrative proceedings, the Commission issued an interim report and order that, among other things, required the sewer company to file new tariffs for residential service after which the Commission would determine the proper rates that could be charged. The sewer company appealed and the circuit court remanded the matter to the Commission for further proceedings. The Commission appealed, arguing that the circuit court should have retained the matter and reviewed the controversy on its merits. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.510 authorized the circuit court to review Commission orders, and either affirm or set them aside, and if an order was set aside, the matter could be remanded. The court noted, however, that an order could be set aside only if it was unlawful or unreasonable or if the Commission had improperly excluded proffered evidence. The court found that the circuit court had not set aside any order upon which to premise the remand. The court found that the circuit court had remanded because it erroneously concluded that Commission orders were not subject to review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court order that remanded the matter to the Commission for further proceedings. The court remanded the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion that the circuit court had authority to review the Commission's order relating to the rate increase requested by the sewer company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that defendant's sentences, in light of the ranges provided by statute and the fact that the sentences were to run concurrently, not consecutively, were found fair and reasonable, not harsh and unfair, and defendant suffered no discrimination either as an individual or as a member of a class. Defendant's allegations that he had ineffective representation at the original hearing was rejected because the same complaints were raised and the same reasons were given in his previous motion and the issue was res judicata. The court found that the sentences were not excessive or more severe than what others convicted of the same offense received because they were within the statutory limits. The court observed that defendant failed to show that systematic discrimination existed there, and objections to his statistical documents should have been sustained because the database was not authenticated and validated, the statistics did not take into account all relevant factors, and the cases included were taken indiscriminately. The court concluded that statistics tending to favor defendant's discrimination claim were nothing more than coincidental.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery in the first degree and was convicted. He filed a pro se motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his conviction and sentence. He was appointed counsel and counsel filed an amended petition alleging that movant pleaded guilty without a full understanding of the consequences of the plea and that his attorney was ineffective in failing to bring to the attention of the court the fact that movant was instrumental in foiling a jailbreak. The circuit court overruled the motion and movant sought review. The court affirmed. The court found that movant's contention that the circuit court impermissibly gave explicit attention to prior convictions in other states in sentencing movant was meritless as it was shown that considering movant's equivocal testimony as to whether he had counsel on those occasions, the evidence was insufficient to support any conclusive determination that the convictions were constitutionally invalid. The court found that movant's counsel was not ineffective as it was firmly established that movant did assist in preventing a jailbreak such that his sentence was cut in half.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was placed on three years' probation after being convicted of tampering with a motor vehicle. Thereafter, a trial court revoked defendant's probation and he appealed, claiming that he was denied due process. The court dismissed defendant's direct appeal, explaining that under the express provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 549.141 the revocation of probation was not subject to review by an appellate court. Although a United States Supreme Court decision suggested that the complete preclusion of judicial review of revocation proceedings might be unconstitutional, the court ruled that it was bound by the statute and that the issue of the statute's constitutionality was for the high court. Because there was no due process requirement of the existence of a direct appeal, such review could be had by a writ of prohibition or a proceeding in habeas corpus. Here, the court noted, no formal writ of habeas corpus was presented to the court. Thus, the appeal needed to be dismissed without prejudice to defendant's commencement of a proper proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was charged with murder and pled not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, and after a psychiatric examination the State accepted the plea. A judgment of acquittal was then entered which included the provision that the care and maintenance of the patient was to be taxed as costs against a city. The patient was committed, but the city discovered the patient was under guardianship and that he had an estate of approximately $ 5,000. The City requested on the basis of these facts that the payment advanced by it be returned and that the patient be reclassified as a private pay patient whose care should be paid by his guardian. Subsequently, the claimant sought further payment from the guardian, the trial court ruled in the claimant's favor, and the guardian sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that any obligation by the guardian to pay for these hospital expenses had to be found within the terms of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.080 and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 202.240 had no application. The court concluded that properly construed Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.080 did not authorize imposition of these expenses upon the guardian.</SPAN></P>

The court found that petitioner's counsel had not properly requested a psychiatric examination and thus, there was no error on the first point. However, the court found petitioner was not afforded due process in the revocation proceedings because no disclosure to petitioner was made of the evidence against him. Petitioner was not realistically afforded an opportunity to present witnesses and documentary evidence or to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses because he was not apprised of the specific charges until the actual revocation hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of sodomy and sentenced to 75 years' imprisonment. Defendant had committed the accused crime while an inmate at the county jail. Defendant had told the victim, also an inmate, that he was in for armed robbery and murder and that he had nothing to lose because he had 40 years to serve. Defendant also told the victim that he was going to make him, pulled his pants down, and using a lubricant, performed an act of anal sodomy on him. The victim and his cellmate were warned not to tell the authorities about the attacks by defendant who said he had a fire hatchet to back up his threats. Defendant appealed. The court held that defendant's assertion that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike all the black members of the jury panel was reversible error was not proved by defendant. Defendant had to prove a consistent, systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury. The court held testimony of the victim testifying defendant said he had 40 years to serve was admissible to prove identity given this fact tended to prove defendant's identity because he did have 40 years to serve at the time of the crime. The trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was acquitted of the federal charge after a trial in which the four bank employees positively identified defendant as one of the bank robbers. There was other incriminating identification testimony against defendant. Thereafter an information charged defendant with robbery in the first degree by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 560.120 and 560.135 (1969). On appeal from that conviction, the issue was whether a defendant who was acquitted of a federal charge of bank robbery be subsequently tried and convicted in state court for robbery? The court answered in the affirmative. The court also held that the state's evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The Board's dismissal was based on a finding of excessive absenteeism, inefficiency, and noncompliance with school policy directives. The trial court reversed the Board's decision.

The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded with directions to reinstate the finding and decision of the Board.

The evidence showed that a truck owned by the corporation struck the husband's vehicle from behind as the husband was making a left-turn, and the impact propelled the husband's vehicle into the path of an incoming vehicle. The widow contended that the circuit court committed error in refusing to permit her cross-examination of the corporation's driver as to his prior criminal convictions. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment for the corporation and remanded the case for a new trial. The court concluded that the suppression of the widow's cross-examination of the driver as to his admitted conviction for crimes was contrary to the absolute right afforded to the widow by Mo. Rev.

The court ruled that &sect; 491.050 gave the widow the absolute right to show the prior convictions for speeding and passing in a no-passing zone for the purpose of affecting the credibility of the driver as a witness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed a petition in replevin against defendant seeking to recover possession of a car. The trial court issued an order of delivery directing the sheriff to immediately take possession of the car and deliver it to plaintiff. There was no hearing or notice to defendant. Plaintiff's motion for an order directing sale of the car was sustained and the proceeds paid to the court registry. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that the pre-hearing seizure was unconstitutional. The trial court granted defendant's motion. The court reversed and remanded. The case law relied upon by the trial court and defendant did not declare that a cause of action in replevin was unconstitutional, only that prejudgment seizure without a due process hearing was unconstitutional. Whatever the effect of the seizure without hearing here, plaintiff's underlying claim in replevin was in no way challenged by defendant's motion. Defendant had appeared before the court and the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the litigation.

On appeal, the trial court affirmed. On further appeal, the court also affirmed. The court held that the board's decision was within the bounds of its authority. The court found that the board erred in admitting certain maps and surveys because they were hearsay, but ruled that the admission was harmless because the crime rate of the present location of the applicant was simply not a material factor to be considered under &sect; 362.325. The court also found that the &quot;convenience and needs of the community&quot; language of &sect; 362.325 was meant to accomplish public protection and not to protect the advantage of established banking houses, so that proof that adequate services were already available in the relocation community did not foreclose an application to relocate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner's contentions raised substantial issues relating to the procedures and requirements to be followed in probation revocation. The court held that the court which granted probation might revoke it, and that the judge was a neutral and detached officer for such purpose. The judicial officer in determining whether to revoke probation was not bound by the findings and recommendations of the probation officer, and he was duty bound to make his own findings and conclusions. Petitioner contended he was not afforded a written statement as to the reasons for revoking probation, and hence was denied due process. The court found no indication that petitioner received a written notice of the probation violations alleged either prior to the preliminary hearing or before the final hearing. Furthermore, there was no written statement by the trial court as to the evidence relied upon or the reasons for revoking petitioner's probation. The court concluded that in the interests of orderly process and, in order to comply with the due process requirements, petitioner was entitled to such notice and the trial court was required to make written findings and the reasons for revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of a second violation of the Controlled Substances Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.020. Thereafter, defendant's motion for a new trial was denied. Defendant appealed, arguing, among other things, that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.020 and 195.020 were unconstitutional, constituted cruel and unusual punishment, and acted to deprive him of his liberty without due process of law. The court held that to invoke appellate review of a constitutional question, the constitutional question had to have been raised at the first opportunity, the constitutional provision claimed to have been violated must have been designated specifically, either by explicit reference to the article and section or by quotation of the provision, the facts showing such violation must have been stated, and the constitutional question must have been presented throughout for review, including presentation in the motion for new trial and adequate coverage in the appellate briefs. Defendant's motion for a new trial however, never mentioned cruel and unusual punishment or due process of law. Therefore, defendant failed to preserve those points for review. The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff public utility corporation appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court, in St. Charles County (Missouri), which granted defendant city's motion to dismiss the corporation's action to enjoin the city from extending its water and sewer lines beyond the city limits and thus competing with corporation's business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The public utility corporation alleged that it alone was authorized to provide water and sewer services to the inhabitants of the city. The city claimed that the public utility corporation failed to state a cause of action against the city and that it did not have standing because nothing contained in the petition alleged that the public utility corporation was a tax-paying citizen of the city. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss on the allegation of failure to state a cause of action but sustained the motion on the allegation of lack of standing. The court held that the public utility corporation had standing to bring an action to enjoin any alleged &quot;illegal&quot; competition by the city. And when the allegations and all reasonable inferences of the petition were taken as true, a question arose as to whether the city was acting within the legislative intent and purpose of the statutes governing its authority to extend utility service beyond its boundaries. The petition, therefore, stated a claim upon which relief could have been granted.</SPAN></P>

The court in the exercise of its discretion did not dismiss the habeas corpus proceeding on the grounds of mootness as the case presented important issues likely to arise again. The court held that: (1) it had jurisdiction over the habeas corpus application because juvenile delinquency was not a criminal charge; (2) &sect; 219.230 was not unconstitutional on the basis that it authorized imprisonment of juveniles without the constitutional protections given to adult inmates because juveniles were not held on the same basis as regular adult inmates but received the benefits of a special program devised for particular juvenile needs; (3) the program under which petitioner was held in the reformatory did not comply with &sect; 219.230 as a program new and different from what already existed for adult inmates was not devised for him; (4) the criteria provided in &sect; 219.230 for transfer were not unduly vague; and (5) proceedings under &sect; 219.230 did not have to be by a new petition rather than by motion in the original case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff in the underlying action filed a petition in the circuit court against relators in their official capacities. He sought a declaratory judgment, alleging that certain provisions of the Missouri Driver's License Act and the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law were unconstitutional as applied to him. Summons was issued and served upon an assistant attorney general and an assistant collector of revenue in relators' respective branch offices located and maintained in Jackson County. Relators filed motions to quash summons on the ground that venue was improper. Respondent overruled the motions. The court made its preliminary rule of prohibition permanent, reasoning that lack of venue was a defect of a jurisdictional nature, which authorized issuance of prohibition. The court ruled that the venue of the underlying action against relators, as executive heads of departments of state government, could lie only in Cole County, where their official residences were located and their principal duties were performed. Venue did not lie in Jackson County, although plaintiff resided there and relators, through their agents operating branch offices, could be found there.</SPAN></P>

Section one of the ordinance provided that a special bond issue election be called for the purpose of submitting to the voters proposition one, which authorized the issuance of the general obligation bonds, and proposition number two, which authorized the issuance of revenue bonds. Both propositions passed. The taxpayer filed an action to enjoin the issuance of the bonds. The city and the associated individuals filed a motion for summary judgment, which was sustained. On review, the taxpayer alleged that because the word &quot;combined&quot; was omitted under proposition number one the voters were not properly informed that they were voting on a combined waterworks system and the improvement of a sewerage system.

The court held that the taxpayers were correct as to the landing fees, but incorrect as to solo flying. The ordinance delegating power to fix fees and the order establishing the fee schedule were null and void because the ordinance did not set forth the necessary standards for the administrative body to follow. In establishing its order prohibiting student solo flying the Commission acted within the provisions of the authority of the ordinance relating to the management and operation of the airport.

Defendants appealed their convictions, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that &sect; 563.280 was not unconstitutionally vague, noting that some vagueness was recognized as inevitable in obscenity statutes. The court found that prosecutions under &sect; 563.280 did not require a prior judicial determination of obscenity. The films seized were viewed by the policewoman, and defendants did not dispute that they were obscene. The arrests were proper without a warrant because defendants had committed a misdemeanor in the presence of the policewoman. The court rejected defendants' contention that their statements to the policewoman before arrest were inadmissible because they were made prior to Miranda warnings.

On appeal, the court held that: 1) the colored photograph of the elderly victim was material and properly admitted into evidence; 2) the instructions on burglary and aiding and abetting were proper; 3) under the &quot;totality of circumstances&quot; rule, defendant's statement, taken without his lawyer or an adult protector present was inadmissible; moreover, 4) the sixth amendment and fundamental fairness required that questioning of defendant, who was a juvenile, while in custody knowing he was represented by counsel and had a parent, without notifying either prior to questioning required exclusion of the video taped statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and sentence of the trial court entered on a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of burglary, and remanded the case for a new trial in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's first motion to vacate judgment and sentence alleged an involuntary plea because of promises by his lawyer that the sentence would be 15 years, mental incompetency at the time of the plea, and the failure of the trial court to comply with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 25.04 before accepting the plea. Following an evidentiary hearing the trial court denied appellant relief and that order was affirmed. In his motion to vacate his judgment and sentence, appellant alleged the trial court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence because the forcible rape statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.260 (1969), required a jury to assess the punishment on a plea of guilty to the charges; further, that he had ineffective assistance of counsel and that he was unconstitutionally sentenced twice. The court affirmed and held that the trial court properly overruled appellant's second motion to vacate his sentence because the present grounds asserted for relief were either alleged in the first Rule 27.26 proceedings, developed in the evidentiary hearing in support of an alleged ground, or could have been raised in the earlier motion.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 407 (1969). The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) granted an injunction. The auto dealer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injunction was issued upon a finding that the auto dealer engaged in three deceptive sales transactions and had a general practice of turning back odometers. On appeal, the auto dealer argued the trial court had no jurisdiction because the attorney general did not make a civil investigation demand. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.100 (1969) did not expressly require a civil investigative demand. The purpose of the civil investigative demand procedure was to provide a form of pretrial discovery for the benefit of the attorney general. That pretrial discovery could be used at the option of the state; non-use by the state did not give the auto dealer a legitimate complaint. The legislature's determination that the expense of private litigation and the increasing use of adhesion contracts created a need for an additional remedy was sufficient authorization for an injunction under the Merchandising Practices Act. Two prohibitions in the injunction were overly broad in that they forbade the auto dealer from engaging in acts for which there was no evidence of a previous violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bank moved to require respondent Commissioner of Finance to show cause why he should not be enjoined from continuing possession of the bank's business and property. The Commissioner moved to dismiss on the basis that the bank's board of directors had not authorized the filing of the motion for show cause. The trial court sustained the commissioner's motion. On appeal, the court remanded the matter, holding that the bank's president had inherent power as president to initiate an action, particularly since an emergency situation was created whereby the president felt that he had to take prompt action without contacting the board in order to protect the corporate assets. The bank's bylaws provided that its president was the principal executive officer of the corporation and was in general control of the property and business of the corporation. The board of directors neither specifically authorized the filing of proceedings nor disapproved of the filing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the sheriff had a right to be reimbursed under &sect;&sect; 57.300 and 57.350 because these provisions controlled over any contrary provisions in the previously enacted County Budget Act, Mo.

One of the men went to the restroom and the other stood near the office entrance. Subsequently the attendant was confronted by the man who had used the restroom. The man was holding a blue steel revolver pointed at the attendant. The man said give me your money, this is a hold-up. The men relieved the attendant of currency and coins, forced him to unlock a back room from which they took some cartons of cigarettes, locked the attendant in the room, and left. The attendant made an in-court identification of defendant as the man with the gun. Defendant was convicted of first-degree robbery. Defendant's major assertion on review was that the closing arguments of the prosecuting attorney which could not be reconciled with a legitimate analysis of the evidence were so extremely inflammatory and prejudicial as to deprive defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the prosecuting attorney's closing argument violated the permissible guidelines for State's in criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and another man entered a business, brandished a weapon, and took money. Defendant was arrested and convicted of robbery in the first degree by means of a dangerous and deadly weapon. Two prior felony convictions were proved and defendant was sentenced under the Second Offender Act. He appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that because evidence fairly showing any form of affirmative participation was sufficient to support a conviction, defendant's contention that he was merely a customer was without merit as a victim testified that it was defendant who took the money. There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision refusing to grant a continuance because the record showed that there was no testimony as to whether a witness that defendant sought to compel could ever be located and the contents of the expected testimony were not set forth to the circuit court. Defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was properly denied because the evidence in question did not come to the knowledge of defendant after the trial and it was not of the quality likely to produce a different verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner's robbery conviction and the denial of his first motion for post-conviction relief were affirmed on appeal. The court held that the trial court was not required to give the prisoner an evidentiary hearing on the second motion under rule 27.26 because he disclosed no reason why his claim of inadequate trial counsel could not have been raised in the prior motion. The court found that the general conclusions in the second motion did not allege facts showing how his counsel failed to prepare a defense and changed the result of the trial by sending the prisoner to a hospital for evaluation. The court held that the prisoner was not deprived of due process when he was denied counsel upon arrest. The court held that the prisoner was not entitled to a reduction of his sentence, which did not exceed the limits provided by law, although it was greater than that of his co-defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Cape Girardeau County (Missouri), which sustained defendant drainage district's motion to quash or, in the alternative to dismiss, two informations charging it with the offense of placing a deleterious substance in the waters of the Little River Drainage ditch in sufficient quantities to injure, stupefy, and kill fish inhabiting the waters, in violation of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 252.210 (West).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court consolidated the two causes because they presented the same issues for appeal. The district filed a motion to dismiss the State's appeal, contending that the State's right of appeal in a criminal case was limited to those instances authorized by Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 28.04. The court noted that there were two instances when the State could appeal in a criminal case, pursuant to Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 547.210 and Mo. Sup Ct. R. 28.04. First, when an indictment or information was adjudged insufficient upon demurrer or exception; and second, where judgment was arrested or set aside. The matter at bar concerned only the first instance. The court noted that the district's motion asserted that Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 252.210 did not apply to it because it was a political subdivision of the State. Thus, the motion was directed to a matter of law, not of fact. It was not based upon the pleadings, but on matters de hors the information itself. Because the motion did not reference the sufficiency of the information, the court held that the trial court considered the grounds set out in the motion in making its ruling. Therefore, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the matter on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court sustained the district's motion to dismiss the appeal in both causes and dismissed the appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Missouri), which granted a motion for summary judgment of defendants, municipality and municipal officials, on the grounds that the petition challenging the legality of proposed municipal bonds failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer's amended petition alleged that two proposed offerings of municipal bonds were unlawful, unauthorized, and beyond the authority of the municipality, and constituted a fraud on the voters. These conclusory allegations were unsupported by factual allegations. Accordingly, the trial court granted a motion for summary filed by the municipality and its officials. The court affirmed, holding that the amended petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, citing Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 55.06. The conclusory allegations of the amended petition, unsupported by factual allegations, could not be taken as true and were to be disregarded in determining whether the taxpayer stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. The taxpayer's argument that he should have been allowed to amend his once-amended petition were not well-taken because he did not advise the trial court of the allegations that would be added by amendment and did not ask leave of the trial court to file a further amendment, but first raised the argument on appeal. Accordingly, there was no abuse by the trial court in that regard.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, in determining the sufficiency of the lessee's petition to state a claim for declaratory judgment, it was to be accorded the benefit of every favorable and reasonable intendment and such petition was not insufficient merely because it lacked definiteness. The court further found that it was not required to take judicial notice of a municipal ordinance. The court held that, although the lessee's action failed to allege facts to show that he was entitled to the relief sought, the dismissal with prejudice was too harsh. The court modified the judgment and ordered a dismissal of the lessee's action without prejudice. The court affirmed as modified the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A small school district sought to annex itself to the larger school district, in order to prevent suffering such annexation at the hands of the State Department of Education. The smaller district voted on annexation and levied a tax as authorized by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 162.751 (1969). The annexing district levied a greater tax for its district prior to the date the annexation was to become effective. The individuals applied for a writ of mandamus to compel the clerk to extend school tax levies in two amounts, to represent the amount voted on by each area of the post-annex district. The clerk of the smaller county argued that the levy could apply to the annexed district after the effective date of the annexation. The court reversed the denial of the writ and held that both the levies were proper under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3 and should have been extended to the properties within the districts when they were levied. The statutory plan provided a mechanism for such a surviving district to assume the benefits of the predecessors' action, and such mechanism was not followed. Therefore, it was proper to order the disparate levies in the two areas of the combined districts.</SPAN></P>

The circuit judge attended the production and declared that it was not obscene under the ordinance. The judge issued a temporary injunction against relators, preventing any interference with the performance. Relators brought a prohibition proceeding, which resulted in a preliminary rule restraining the judge from any further action. Relators sought to make the prohibition absolute. The court denied relief, finding that the issue had become moot because &quot;Hair&quot; had completed its run of performances. A case was moot when the issues presented for decision were submitted for judgment upon a matter which, if the judgment was rendered, could have had no practical effect upon any then existing controversy. Although the court determined that the temporary injunction should not have been issued, the entire matter was moot and the preliminary writ of prohibition was quashed.</SPAN></P>

The case was tried on stipulated facts without a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Many months after filing its return, the taxpayer received a tax statement increasing the valuation of its inventory by more than 300 percent. Claiming it never received the statutory notice, the taxpayer paid under protest, but the officials offered at trial a copy of a notice that gave a list of hearing dates, but was not signed or verified. There was no testimony to show the notice was mailed, and the trial court found that the statement was the first notice of increase received. The officials defended on governmental immunity, voluntary payment, and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On review, the court found that governmental immunity was not a valid defense because provisions for appellate review under Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect;&sect; 536.110 and 536.150 operated as consent to suit, and that once the taxpayer complied with reporting requirements, the officials were required to give statutory notice of the increase. Because the required notice was either never sent or insufficient, the court found that the increase was unauthorized, and that the compulsion and duress associated with the tax, penalties, and interest at issue permitted payment under protest.</SPAN></P>

In 1945, the applicant was granted a presidential pardon for his service in World War II. From the late 1940's until 1969, the applicant held a liquor employee's permit continuously, with brief interruptions. Under Mo. Rev.

On appeal, the director argued that the pardon had not reestablished the applicant's eligibility for the permit, while the applicant argued to the contrary. The court agreed with the applicant and affirmed the judgment granting the permit. The court noted that the sole and exclusive reason for the director's refusal to issue the permit was the 1938 conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The controversy between the parties arose following the enforcement of the city's housing code and an action instituted against the owners. As a result, the owners filed a petition in federal court. Thereafter, the owners filed a petition in state court asserting a substantially identical petition. However, the owners dismissed the federal action against the city, but proceeded to trial against the inspector with a judgment entered in favor of the inspector. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the city and the inspector. Specifically, the court first noted that the city was in privity with the inspector, that the two causes pleaded in the federal and state actions were identical, and that there had been no showing of any variance between them in any respect. Hence, the court determined that the same &quot;material facts or questions&quot; were in issue in both cases as a common nucleus of operative fact. Therefore, the common issues could not be relitigated, either against the inspector, or against his privy, the city. Lastly, the court reiterated that the city had governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff building assignee challenged an order of the Circuit Court of City of St. Louis (Missouri), which dismissed his petition for review of administrative procedure under Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 536 (1959) and for a stay order under &sect; 536.120. The assignee was attempting to reverse the order of defendant city's building appeals board, which affirmed the city's building commissioner's order condemning property allegedly owned by the assignee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city's building commissioner condemned a dangerous building and sent detailed findings to the property owner by registered mail on October 31, 1969. The owner was ordered to remove the building within seven days, during which time he could appeal to the building appeals board. According to the assignee, five days later the building owner conveyed his interest to the assignee. Two days later, he appealed to the board, which affirmed the commissioner's condemnation order. The assignee filed a petition for review seeking a declaration that the building code and ordinances involved were unconstitutional and an injunction against demolition. The assignee, acting pro se, sought three extensions of time in which to file the transcript of the record before the board. In his second request, the assignee said he was hoping for money to fall from heaven so he could pay the preparation fee. The trial court dismissed the assignee's petition for failure to provide the record as required by Mo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 536.130 (1959). On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to wait for the assignee's requested miracle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision refusing to grant the assignee additional time to file a board transcript and dismissing his petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The clerk and recorder were duly elected in a county of the second class having an assessed value of $ 312 million. The officials failed to pay them a salary, believing that they lacked authority under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 50.334 because it provided no salary for a county of the second class having an assessed valuation in excess of $ 300 million. In granting the clerk and recorder mandamus relief compelling the payment of salaries to them, the court held that the rule of strictly construing statutes providing compensation for public officers did not apply where there was a complete denial of compensation because a salary was required to be paid to county officers under Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 11 and 12. Even though the statute did not expressly provide a salary for the clerk and recorder, it was not unconstitutional. The legislature intended Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 50.334 to apply to all second class counties and, by operation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48.030, to apply to any county that had exceeded the valuation for its class, but had not yet changed classification, so that counties exceeding the maximum valuation would continue to be governed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 50.334.</SPAN></P>

While the case was under submission, defendant filed an amended motion to dismiss. Defendant reasserted his claim under the Missouri Constitution and added a claim under the United States Constitution. Pursuant to Mo. Const. art.

Defendant's motion to dismiss was more timely than such a motion in a previous case that was found to be valid. The constitutional provisions that were alleged to be violated were specified.

Defendants were being restrained by respondent director of a correctional institution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The university sought to prohibit defendants and others from a broad range of activities which interfered with the operation of the university or the activities of other people using its facilities, or damaged the university's property or that of others on the university's premises. The circuit court issued a temporary restraining order and order to show cause, with bond filed as called for in the order. Thereafter, a riot occurred, for which defendants were convicted and punished as being in civil and criminal contempt of the temporary restraining order. Defendants filed a writ of habeas corpus and the court held that: (1) the jail sentences imposed on defendants for civil contempt were illegal as there were no elements of civil contempt in the punishment imposed; (2) defendants five, six, and seven were illegally restrained for criminal contempt as there was no evidence that they had actual knowledge of the temporary restraining order; and (3) defendants one, two, three, and four were legally restrained for criminal contempt as they had knowledge of the temporary restraining order and the conduct prohibited thereunder in order to allow them to properly prepare their defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A director could find an old age benefits claimant received benefits to which she was not entitled, as she misrepresented or failed to disclose material facts concerning her eligibility, as she violated Mo.

Review was governed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.100(5) (1959). As the director followed the terms of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.010(2)(2) in applying a finding that the claimant was ineligible for one year, and the essential facts agreed upon justified such action, the appellate court could characterize the decision as arbitrary or unreasonable. The claimant lacked standing to attack the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.010(2)(2), as the record was void of any evidence concerning her eligibility for old age assistance. Failing in her proof of entitlement to benefits at the administrative hearing, the claimant could not assert that the imposition of a penalty of one year of ineligibility deprived her of her constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board adopted an ordinance relating to wood shingles. On appeal, the district argued that the evidence did not show that it had abused its power to regulate and control the construction of buildings by prohibiting the use of wood shingles and shakes for roof coverings or prescribing masonry walls to back shingle or shake trim. The court found that the lower court concluded the ordinance to be unreasonable because the district did not establish fire limits in which the ordinance would have been applicable but rather prohibited wood shingle and shake roofing in the entire district. The court ruled that the reasoning of the lower court was invalid. Delay could have caused unreasonable expense to the property owner in conformity alteration and an unnecessary exposure to hazard on the part of the occupier of premises. Sufficient facts existed at the time of enactment of the ordinance to make the question of prohibiting wood shingles or shakes debatable. The court ruled that it had to defer to the conclusion of the board.</SPAN></P>

The court dissolved the preliminary writ, and found that the statute did not contain any language that indicates that it was intended to apply only to those actions that accrued after its effective date. The court further found that the statute was procedural; that it did not create any substantive rights or legal relationships; and that it was retroactive in its application to causes of action which accrued before the effective date of the law and suits pending at that time.</SPAN></P>

The mother also admitted that during the time she lived with defendant she was married to another man. Defendant denied that he was the father of the children, but admitted that the children were born during the five-year period in which he lived with the mother. On appeal, defendant argued &sect; 559.353 was unconstitutional because it failed to set up a separate judicial procedure to establish paternity before permitting a trial under the statute. The court held that defendant failed to properly preserve such an issue because he failed to raise the issue before the trial court. Contrary to defendant's contention, the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the case. The court held the evidence was sufficient to overcome the presumption of legitimacy because the evidence demonstrated that the children in question were born during the time the mother and defendant lived together and there were not any children born to the mother since defendant left her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, members of a city board of adjustment, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), reversing a decision of the board and ordering it to instruct the director of public works to issue permits to plaintiff owners for demolition and building and temporarily enjoining the board from preventing, obstructing or interfering with the owners in repairing the building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the owners' building was erected, it complied with zoning laws, but the city amended to require a 70-foot setback. The county widened the road and provided for acquisition of property by eminent domain. A condemnation suit was filed, including a portion of the property and building. The previous owners conveyed to the county the triangular piece of property, but on the same day, conveyed the remainder of the parcel to the owners. The owners applied to the director for a permit to demolish a portion of the building on the county's property and to construct a wall at the new right-of-way line to preserve the remaining portion of the building. The director refused to issue the permit, and the owners appealed to the board, which upheld the refusal. The owners appealed, the trial court held for the owners, and the board appealed. The court held that the damage to the owners' building resulted from a sale subsequent to condemnation proceedings. Thus, the sale was not voluntary, and the damage was caused by forces beyond the owners' control. Hence, the request for the building permit was not to expand a non-conforming use but to restore a building damaged by an act of the sovereign.</SPAN></P>

In their petition for the writ of prohibition, relators alleged the ordinance was an unreasonable exercise of its police power and was void for uncertainty. The court found that the ordinance was not an unreasonable exercise of the municipal police power granted by the state legislature. The ordinance, reasonably construed, applied only to the property of other persons. The commonly accepted meaning of &quot;vandalism&quot; was the unauthorized damaging of property belonging to another person, and conversely did not mean the damaging of one's own property. That refuted relators' contention that the ordinance was unreasonable by forbidding destruction of any property. Further, the ordinance reasonably described the acts that constituted the offense. It prohibited acts of vandalism by defacing, marring, discoloring, or damaging another person's property. Those were words of common usage and meaningful to persons of ordinary intelligence, thereby meeting the legal standard for definiteness. The ordinance was not unreasonable and there was error in prohibiting its enforcement.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment that overruled a decision by the Board in the landowner's favor, the court held that its review of decisions of the Board was not limited to a search for evidence competent to support the decision. The court held also that it had a mandate to determine if the decision was authorized by law. The court noted that a variance from the set-back lines could be granted under St. Louis County, Mo., Ordinance &sect; 1004.070(5) for practical difficulties or hardship caused by an irregular-shaped lot, topographical, or other conditions.

Taking a de novo review of the two statements of facts, the court ruled that the child was clearly the natural child of the decedent. Decedent was living with the mother at the time the child was conceived, he acknowledged the child as his own, and he paid child support and school tuition for the child.

The court explained that point II failed to state any reason why the ruling of the trial court was claimed to be erroneous, which also violated Rule 83.05(e) and presented nothing for review. The court noted that the property owners were not in any position to complain of the failure of the city to give notice because one of the property owners had actual knowledge that the hearing would have been held and she voiced no objection to the failure to give notice at the meeting.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with unlawfully and feloniously selling a stimulant drug. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that defendant was not arrested until 6 months after the State had probable cause to arrest. After finding that it had jurisdiction, the court issued the writ. The court found that the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction. The information charging defendant was filed within the time period required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 541.200 (1959). There was nothing in the statutory law or in the provisions of the state or federal constitutions that required an arrest to be made immediately following the arresting officers' knowledge of probable cause. Defendant had no right to be arrested immediately upon the seizure of the evidence and the State had a right to issue an information for the offense committed at any time within three years after the commission of the offense. Thus, the circuit court was directed to vacate and set aside its order dismissing the information filed against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city, which sought to annex plaintiff landowners' properties, sought review of a declaratory judgment issued by the Circuit Court of Clay County (Missouri), which enjoined annexation. The city's motion to dismiss was sustained, and the landowners appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, which held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.105 of the Sawyers Act was constitutional and applicable to the city, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted seven similar ordinances extending the city limits. Enactment of each ordinance was an expression of intent to annex unincorporated land. Once the governing body of the city announced its intention to annex an unincorporated area of land, regardless of how that intention was expressed, the requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.105 of the Sawyers Act were mandatory before the city could exercise the delegated legislative authority to annex. Upon remand, the court held that the city could not annex the area because it had no power to do so, having failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Sawyers Act. Each of the ordinances constituted an expression of intent to annex at a specified future date. Annexation did not take effect on the date the annexation ordinance was enacted when the ordinance provided that the annexation should take effect at a future date. Therefore there was no annexation prior to the effective date of the Sawyers Act. The city's attempted annexation was void for failure to comply with the Act.</SPAN></P>

The citizen appealed the board's decision to the trial court. The trial court affirmed the board's decision. The citizen appealed, contending that the cancellation of his voter registration was unlawful, unauthorized, and unconstitutional because his conviction would have only been a misdemeanor under Missouri law. The court held that case law in Missouri stated that language that limited rights for those convicted of a felony applied to those who were convicted of a felony in federal court.

The ambulance driver challenged the propriety of a contributory negligence instruction given for the automobile driver by the trial court. He argued that while operating an emergency vehicle and answering an emergency, he was justified in assuming that the automobile driver would observe &sect; 304.022(1) and yield the right-of-way until he knew or, in the exercise of ordinary care, should have known that the automobile driver obviously did not intend to do so. The court found that by voluntarily submitting &quot;the highest degree of care&quot; as the standard of his own duty, the ambulance driver lost the right to complain that this contributory negligence instruction also required him to exercise the highest degree of care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners were the owners of a pie-shaped tract of land consisting of about five acres. The only access to their property was by a narrow unpaved lane, which was dedicated but not accepted because it did not meet the minimum width required for a street. The land owned by the landowners was in a Class B, single family residential district. The landowner sought permission to build six eight family apartment buildings on an area comprising several acres of their property. They applied to the building commissioner for a permit to construct the apartment buildings. After the building commissioner refused to grant the permit the board of adjustment ordered the building commissioner to issue the permit. The neighbors who resided in the single family residential subdivision instituted an action to invalidate the board of adjustment action. The lower court affirmed the board of adjustment decision. On review the court reversed and remanded. The court held that based on case law regardless of the practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, which might exist, a board of adjustment did not have the power to grant a variance for a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs contended that the court's original opinion was in direct conflict with a supreme court opinion. The court determined that the supreme court opinion did not rule the case so as to require a change in the court's original opinion. The court found that the supreme court opinion did not involve a constitutional charter city and did not rule upon the applicability of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 71.860 (West 1959) because &sect; 71.860 was not involved in that case. The court determined that the supreme court opinion concerned the applicability of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 71.870 (West 1959). In addition, the court found that the supreme court opinion dealt with an annexation that was not completed prior to the effective date of &sect; 71.870. The court noted that the annexation in this case was completed prior to the effective date of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 71.860 (West 1959). The court also determined that a second supreme court opinion handed down after the motion was filed did not require a change in the court's original opinion because there was nothing in that opinion to indicate that &sect; 71.860 was applicable to an annexation completed prior to its effective date.</SPAN></P>

The claimant asserted a &quot;vested right&quot; to such payments and that the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 287.270 and 287.160 (1959) were misconstrued.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the claimant elected benefits payments under the plan, which barred further claims against the employer arising from the accident; (2) the claimant's election to receive payments under the plan provided him with no vested right to such payments, which would have permitted recovery of additional workmen's compensation benefits once the election was made; (3) although Mo.

The mother and the daughter had previously filed actions against the driver in another county, a county in which the administrator of the father's estate had resided. In those actions, the driver and the estate were named as defendants. Those actions were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and the mother and daughter then filed their actions in the county in which the accident occurred. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the driver, and the court affirmed. It held that where the actions were filed more than seven years after the accident, they were barred under a five-year statute of limitations. It further held that a savings statute,&nbsp;Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 516.230 (1959), was not applicable because the actions brought in the first county, which were timely, had not been &quot;commenced&quot; within the meaning of the savings statute.</SPAN></P>

One purpose of the initiative ordinance was to abolish the existing Land Clearance for Redevelopment Authority of Columbia. Columbia, Mo., Ordinance No. 485, adopted by the city council and the people of the city, was legislative in nature and not merely administrative or executive. It was an expression by the council and the people of their desire and decision to elect to become a &quot;community&quot; under state law and to adopt and to make the Land Clearance For Redevelopment Authority Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 99.300 (1959), applicable to the city. The law was not enacted to effect solely municipal objectives. There were state purposes to be fulfilled by the statute. The court did not believe it was the intent of the state legislature in enacting the statute in the light of a state need to permit a municipality which found the local need for it, solely by municipal action to be able to withdraw itself from the provisions of that statute established to cure or better those very conditions causing the need.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant driver appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Dunklin County (Missouri), which entered judgment in accordance with a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff passenger, in the passenger's action to recover damages for personal injuries she sustained when the driver lost control of the vehicle in which the parties were travelling. The accident occurred in Arkansas; as such, Arkansas substantive law applied to the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver argued that the passenger had no cause of action under the Arkansas guest statutes, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 75-913 - 75-915, because the passenger was a &quot;guest&quot; and could not establish that the vehicle was wilfully and wantonly operated. On appeal, the court disagreed. A passenger was a guest if the transportation conferred a benefit only on the passenger; guest status did not arise if the transportation was primarily for the driver to attain an objective purpose. Evidence established that the driver requested the passenger's assistance in making a trip for the sole purpose of purchasing furniture for the driver's home. Thus, the jury could have reasonably inferred that the trip was undertaken to attain an objective of the driver and that a tangible, substantial benefit accrued to her by virtue of the passenger's assistance. As such, the passenger's status was an issue for the jury, and the driver's directed verdict motion was properly denied. Finally, references to willful negligence in the passenger's complaint did not render the complaint insufficient to state a simple negligence claim, because those references were considered surplusage and, accordingly, were disregarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the passenger in her negligence action against the driver.</SPAN></P>

The defendants were held in criminal contempt by the sheriff and the warden due to alleged violations of the injunction. The defendants brought petitions for writs of habeas corpus seeking release from detention alleging that they were denied due process because they were not granted an adequate time to prepare their defense. The court ruled that in a contempt case the alleged contemnor was entitled to a notice which fairly and fully informed him of the specific acts of contempt with which he was charged, and that this notice must be given so as to afford a reasonable time to make his defense. The court granted the petitions as to some of the defendants and denied the petitions as to others, concluding that the defendants failed to allege in their answer or state in their brief any facts which led to the conclusion that they were denied due process by the trial court's action in proceeding to trial after their counsel announced ready.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction, alleging that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.350 was unconstitutional and that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict. The court affirmed. First, the court held that &sect; 559.350 was not vague because the term &quot;adequate support&quot; meant personal support, maintenance, food, and clothing reasonably suitable to the condition in life and commensurate with defendant's ability. The evidence showed that over a period of a year, defendant gave approximately $ 250 in support for his child and that the child had a medical infirmity. The record also showed that defendant purchased a new home for his wife and a vehicle, despite his statement that he suffered from an old disability. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that defendant failed to pay adequate support for the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On complaint of respondent City of Kansas City, Missouri, defendant was convicted in a municipal court of violating Kansas City, Mo., Ordinances &sect; 47.070, titled &quot;Soliciting for Immoral Purposes.&quot; The Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri affirmed. On appeal, the issues included the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant's claim that she was entrapped, the validity of the ordinance, and the propriety of the information and a jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a volunteer member of the City police force indicated to a hotel bellhop that he would like to have a good time, defendant arrived and offered a sexual service. On appeal, the court held that the proof of solicitation of the sexual act was sufficient to establish a violation of &sect; 47.070. It necessarily followed that the corpus delicti was also established. The necessary intent could be inferred from the evidence, which the court found sufficient to prove the violation. The court held that the information did not deny defendant the opportunity to prepare a defense. It complied with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 37.17. The court held that the evidence required the submission of her entrapment claim to the jury. Although the trial court should have instructed on the issue, its failure to do so was not raised in a motion for new trial, so defendant had waived the issue. She did not raise the constitutionality of &sect; 47.070 at her earliest opportunity at trial, so the court would not consider the issue. Nor did her other challenge to &sect; 47.070 have merit. But, a jury instruction cited an erroneous date for the offense and the City did not sustain its burden of proving that the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appealing defendant was convicted of exposing to sale goods, wares, and merchandise on Sunday.

The court held that although the difference existed in legal parlance, it certainly meant the same thing to the jury. Since the state supreme court held the question to be prejudicial error in the precedential case, the court held that the voir dire examination was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.110 (1959).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee worked for the employer as a secretary until her discharge. She was not paid her wages for the last week she worked. After making proper written demand, she filed suit. The employer's defense was that at the time of her discharge the employee was indebted to the employer for $ 132 because it had paid an employment agency fee owed by her based on her promise to repay the fee. She denied this and testified that the employer had agreed to assume and pay the fee. She argued that the trial court erred in refusing to give a particular jury instruction and that the jury had miscalculated the penalty amount. Her motion to amend the judgment or grant a new trial on damages was denied. The employer's motion to set aside the judgment was also denied. The court reversed the judgment but held that remanding for retrial on damages would be a futile gesture. Because of the time intervening between discharge and verdict, it was obvious and undisputed that the jury used a much lower rate in calculating the penalties than they should have used. As it was merely a matter of calculation, the court did the calculation and remanded with directions to enter the amount specified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school board did not renew the teacher's contract for the upcoming year and sent the required notice before the required date under &sect; 163.090. The teacher filed suit for breach of contract on grounds that he had tenure and that the school board could not terminate him unless it first notified him of deficiencies and gave him an opportunity to improve. The teacher also claimed that the school board's requirement that all teachers pay dues to four teacher organizations should be declared null and void. The trial court dismissed the teacher's claims. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the teacher had no tenure because tenure was not allowed under &sect; 163.090, which clearly contemplated the execution of a new, specific, and distinct annual contract for each year. The court also held the school board properly acted because the teacher was not dismissed or discharged, he simply was not offered a contract to teach for the following school year. The court also held that the teacher stated claim for return of dues paid, but that the school board's rule was reasonable and that the teacher was estopped by accepting his salary.</SPAN></P>

The claimant's motion sought permission to withdraw the claim and to be permitted to file under common law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant based his motion upon a charge that the city falsely and fraudulently represented that it was a self-insurer and covered by workmen's compensation. The claimant alleged that the city was not so covered at the time of his injury. The claimant's contention stemmed from an opinion by the Attorney General of Missouri holding that Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 287.090, which authorized municipalities to elect to come under the Worker's Compensation Act was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment, finding that while attorney general's opinions were entitled to great weight, such opinions did not become the law of the land. The court determined that the opinion of the Attorney General that municipalities could not constitutionally be covered effected no change whatsoever in the legal status of the parties. Further, the court found that there was no showing that the city ever withdrew its surety, either in the form of securities or otherwise. Thus, the court concluded that the city was at all times qualified as a self-insurer under the Act. The court remanded with directions to order the Commission to reinstate its award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on a city ordinance, the city's architectural control commission denied certain building permits to a landowner who sought to build residential homes. The landowner successfully sought a writ of mandamus to compel issuance of the permits and the city's building commissioner appealed. The court first determined that it had jurisdiction to consider the appeal because, while certain issues of constitutionality were raised, the lower court's decision did not appear to involve construction of the Constitution. The court went on to note that zoning ordinances were a function of the city's police power that was granted to the city by statute. Here, Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 89.020 (1949) did not grant to the city the right to impose upon the land owner aesthetic standards for the buildings he chose to erect. Moreover, the court found that the statutory grant was to the legislative body of the city and could not be delegated to an Architectural Control Commission. Accordingly, the court found that the city's ordinance was void and affirmed the judgment issuing the writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The electric company claimed authority for its acts under the Commission's order entered in another case, granting a certificate of convenience and necessity to a predecessor company and also the Commission's order in a second case, approving the transfer of corporate rights from the predecessor company to the electric company. The court rejected the landowners' principal contention that the previously issued certificate of convenience and necessity conferred no authority upon the electric company to construct the planned transmission line. The electric company was not required under Mo. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner alleged that he was the owner of property in a subdivision created by a trust indenture. The trust indenture restricted the use of many of the lots in the subdivision for various purposes, depending upon the lot locations, for a term of over 30 years. The trustees filed a deed that extended the restrictions for an additional 50 years. The property owner alleged that the provisions of the modified deed were void and that the extension agreement imposed an unlawful burden upon each lot in the subdivision. The property owner maintained that he brought the action on behalf of himself and other owners of similarly situated lots. The trustees argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction because the action was not a class action. The trial court entered its decree in favor of the property owner, holding that the restrictions were null and void. On appeal de novo, the court held that the action constituted a class action under the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 507.070 (1949) and Mo. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court determined that because of an explicit provision of the county charter that required the county council to enter into a cooperation only by an ordinance, an agreement entered into with the county housing authority under a resolution was invalid. The county council passed an ordinance to enter into the cooperation agreement. The voters filed a timely petition with the board of election commissioners that called for a referendum on the ordinance. A motion on the petition was defeated. The voters filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the members of the board of election commissioners to submit the ordinance to a vote of the electorate. The trial court entered a judgment that denied the writ. Reversing the judgment, the court held that the ordinance in question was legislative in character. The court found that the cooperation agreement bound the county to adopt ordinances to open and close streets, to grant deviations from its building code, and to zone and rezone the area in and surrounding the project.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged and found guilty of violating a local city ordinance for driving a vehicle in excess of 33 feet. Defendant appealed his conviction, claiming that it was unconstitutional. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to consider defendant's constitutional claims because the claims were not properly preserved and only the state supreme court had jurisdiction to hear such claims. However, the court determined that the ordinance was invalid because it conflicted with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 304.170, which allowed defendant to drive a vehicle up to 45 feet in length. The court also stated that the city was not authorized to enact an ordinance in violation of conflict with &sect; 304.170, and therefore defendant's conviction for violating the invalid ordinance was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sued defendant corporation for payment on three negotiable instruments that plaintiffs bought from payee. Defendant, payor on the instruments, issued them to payee in exchange for payee's services. Defendant claimed that payee was a foreign corporation doing business illegally in Missouri, so the instruments were void. Trial court entered a directed verdict for defendant and denied plaintiffs' motion for a new trial. Plaintiff appealed, claiming the issue was whether a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument purchased from an unlicensed foreign corporation could prevail. Appellate court reversed trial court's decision and ordered a new trial. The controlling statute, the Missouri Negotiable Instruments Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.635, had been amended shortly before plaintiffs sued. Under the old version, a negotiable instrument made by an unlicensed foreign corporation was void and unenforceable. Appellate court held that the amendments changed the meaning of the statute so that negotiable instruments made by unlicensed foreign corporations were not absolutely void but were merely unenforceable until the foreign corporation complied with the licensing statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was subsequently convicted of issuing a check with intent to defraud. Defendant was sentenced to confinement for six months and fined $ 500. Defendant appealed his conviction to the Missouri Supreme Court on the basis that it was unconstitutional to permit imprisonment for a debt, but that court determined it did not have jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Court of Appeals. The court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction and sentence, and ordered defendant discharged. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to grant defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal because there was an absence of evidence showing an actual intent to defraud as required under Mo.

The court noted that defendant had provided the payee a post-dated check and the payee had erroneously deposited the check prior to the date the check became due.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees applied for a certificate of occupancy seeking permission to erect a two-story addition to an existing building. The court found that the city ordinance gave appellant Board authority to affirm or modify any determination appealed from. The time fixed for hearing by appellant Board was reasonable. The ordinance, practically construed, did not compel appellant Board to determine the record owners of each parcel of land in the block and to serve each because it would deny appellant Board any right to hold a hearing for the purpose of considering appeals. However, appellant Board lacked the authority to relieve any of the provisions of the ordinance upon a finding that the neighborhood changed from residential to commercial. Appellant Board lacked the authority and jurisdiction to enter the order and the order could be attacked in any manner. Equitable estoppel could not purge transactions of the fatal infirmity of being in violation of the law. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The surveyor obtained a surveyor license from the state. However, when the surveyor performed surveying work in the city of St. Louis, he was warned that he would be thrown in jail if he did so again. The surveyor sought to obtain a license to do surveying work in the city. The surveyor was told he would have to receive an appointment from the mayor, but when he went to the mayor's office he was told that he would also have to be a resident of the city. The trial court concluded that neither condition applied. The court agreed and rejected the city's contention that the surveyor failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Any confusion in the surveyor's claim for relief was based on the city's interpretation of its ordinances governing his right to do surveying work in the city. The surveyor's contention stated a valid claim under the declaratory judgment statutes. The surveyor's claim presented a justiciable controversy in that the surveyor was faced with prosecution if he attempted surveying work in the city, and because the surveyor was told he could not do surveying work without being a resident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants had ordered a primary election to nominate candidates for city elective offices and to elect committeemen. The voters alleged that the rules and regulations adopted by defendants for the primary elections were unconstitutional, illegal, and void. Specifically, the voters attacked the limited hours of voting and the number of open polling places. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim upon which the relief sought could be granted. The voters conceded that they would not be entitled to relief if only candidates for city offices were nominated. Thus, the voters' sole argument was that the general election laws applied because the committeemen being elected were &quot;public officers.&quot; The court noted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77.370 (1949) did not include committeemen in the enumerated elective officers. Contrary to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77.390, 77.400 (1949), the committeemen drew no salary and took no oath of office. The court concluded that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77.040 (1949), which required city elections to be held pursuant to the general elections laws, related to the election of the &quot;elective officers,&quot; and not political committeemen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, the mother of three minor children, brought an original proceeding in habeas corpus to obtain custody of the children, who were in the custody of respondents, the director and employees of the county welfare office. The children had been placed in county custody after a juvenile court had found that they were &quot;neglected&quot; within the meaning of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.031 (1949). The mother claimed that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that &sect; 211.031 was violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, in that it was so vague, indefinite and uncertain that no ascertainable standard of conduct regarding the care of children was fixed by it. The court disagreed and held that the statute was constitutional. The court noted that it was not dealing with the protection afforded by the Due Process Clause to those charged with crime. Even in cases where a child was charged as a delinquent, no crime was charged. Therefore, the constitutional guarantees in respect to criminal cases did not apply. Furthermore, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 211.03, while broad, did not grant jurisdiction that was any more extensive than the equity jurisdiction historically provided by the state constitution. In addition, &sect; 211.031 provided standards to the juvenile court in its exercise of its discretion in that it was required to exercise great regard for the rights of all parties concerned. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The children were ordered remanded to the custody of respondents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered that the children be remanded to the custody of respondents.</SPAN></P>

Following trial, the jury returned its verdict awarding $ 1.3 million to the affected property owners. Certain property owners moved to vacate the jury's verdict. After the trial court denied their motion and rendered its judgment in accordance with the verdict, these property owners appealed. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court concluded that the provisions of art. VI, &sect; 155, of the Charter of Kansas City, Missouri, required that a motion for a new trial be filed within four days after the rendition of a verdict; if a party failed to file such a motion, then the issues complained of were not preserved for appellate review. The property owners failed to file a timely motion for a new trial, and although other affected property owners may have done so, each affected property owner in a condemnation proceeding was a separate and distinct party. The property owners here could not tack their untimely motions to the timely motion of another party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The neighboring property owners opposed the rezoning application on the ground that heavy truck traffic would create noise and disturbance in a residential area, decreasing property values. Two months after the application was granted, the neighboring property owners filed a petition in the trial court seeking judicial review of the zoning board's decision. The trial court, in affirming the decision, failed to specifically rule on the defense that the petition was untimely filed. On review, the court found that there was no competent and substantial evidence in the record to support the zoning board's order and the trial court's affirmance of that order. The court held, however, that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.110, which required an appeal from a zoning board of adjustment to be taken within 30 days, was applicable. Because the neighboring property owners challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 89.110, the court transferred the case to the Missouri Supreme Court for decision of the constitutional question.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 111.710, in his race for township member of a political party county committee. The candidate's motions for directed verdict and a new trial were denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecuting attorney brought an action to recover a penalty from the candidate for his failure to file the required campaign expense statement. The jury returned a verdict against the candidate and assessed a penalty. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 111.710 applied to the candidate even though he received no salary. The assertion that there was no designation of the office in which his statement should have been filed was without merit, as the statute sufficiently provided that the statement be filed with the county clerk and a copy with the recorder of deeds. The candidate was not exempt even though he neither spent nor promised to spend any money. The jury instruction given regarding the penalty followed the wording of the statute. Because the political party committeeman was a public officer within the purview of the law for election contests, provided by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 124.250, the court found that it logically followed that the candidate was likewise a public officer within the purview of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 129.110.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the federal government had not so pre-empted the field through the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 601 (1937), as to preclude the Commission from jurisdiction to require an operating certificate and to regulate hauling rates because (1) Congress had not clearly manifested its purpose to supersede or suspend the exercise of the police powers of the states and such unexpressed purpose could not be inferred or implied; and (2) the Act did not include public transportation carriers within its provisions of subjects or commodities to be regulated.

A default decree of divorce was issued, and the husband filed a motion to set aside the decree. The wife filed a motion to dismiss the husband's motion, but the trial court sustained the husband's motion and reinstated the cause on the trial docket. The wife appealed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife had alleged in her petition that that the husband could not be personally served because he had absconded himself to avoid service of process and because his address was unknown to her. The husband asserted in his motion that he had always been a Michigan resident and that the wife's charge that the husband's address was unknown was false. The wife argued in her motion that the husband's motion should be dismissed because his motion was a petition for review and was not allowable in a divorce action and because he could not show lack of jurisdiction outside the original record except by appeal. The court held that the judgment and decree had become final at the time of the filing of the husband's motion and were not subject to review by the trial court under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.110 (1949). The court ruled that &sect; 452.110 did not apply where the court nisi was devoid of jurisdiction ab initio. The court decided that the trial court never had jurisdiction over the husband under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 3.27 because the wife's allegations in her affidavit for constructive service were inconsistent.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 89.020, 89.040 and was spot zoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The buyer was under contract to purchase the property in question for the erection and operation of a drive-in theater. The tract was rezoned by the city by amending the zoning ordinance. The property owners lived in the vicinity of the rezoned tract. The trial court declared the amended ordinance invalid and enjoined defendants from constructing and operating a theater on the rezoned tract. Defendants sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court held that the power to permit or forbid the erection of a building of a particular kind or for a particular use was to be determined, not by an abstract consideration of the building or of the thing considered apart, but by considering it in connection with the surrounding circumstances and the locality. The court ruled that the evidence strongly supported the conclusion that the construction of the theater would materially depreciate the value of the homes in the immediate area. The court concluded that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.040 (1949) provided that zoning regulations should be made with reasonable consideration for conserving the value of other buildings.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a motion to transfer the appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner alleged that the property had never been usable, adaptable, or suitable for residential purposes, but nevertheless the city had zoned it and restricted its use to one family dwellings. The landowner argued that the ordinance resulted in a taking and damaging of the landowner's property without compensation and without due process of law. On appeal, the court held that with regard to factors that the landowner claimed prevented the property's use as suitable residential property, the landowner knew of them when he acquired the property. The court found that the comprehensive zoning ordinance and its enforcement was responsible for and had a beneficial effect on the development of the city and had raised property values throughout the city including the landowner's. The court found that the landowner's motion for new trial completely failed to mention any constitutional question in it and if he desired to preserve and urge any such question on appeal it was his duty to call to the attention of the circuit court his contention that it had ruled erroneously on the question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a corporation and the Industrial Commission of Missouri, sought review of the judgment of the circuit court (Missouri), which reversed the decision of the Commission and remanded the case thereto. The Commission had reversed an order by respondent Division of Employment Security, which had ruled that the corporation was an &quot;employer&quot; under the Missouri Employment Security Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.010 et seq. (Supp. 1955).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation, a motel, had less than eight employees and thus did not qualify, by itself, as an &quot;employer&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.030(14)(4), for purposes of being liable for the unemployment tax under the Missouri Employment Security Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.010 et seq. (Supp. 1955). However, the Division combined the corporation's employees with those of a grocery business, as they were under the same ownership, in order to achieve the required number of employees for liability for the tax. The Commission found no substantial evidence of unification of the two businesses and decided not to treat them as a single unit. The circuit court reversed the Commission. The court reversed the circuit court and remanded the case to that court for entry of a judgment affirming the Commission's decision. The court held that, as a matter of law, there was no substantial evidence to support a finding that there was an actual unification of control of the corporation and the grocery business as contemplated by &sect; 288.030(14)(4). Nor was it reasonable to expect such businesses to be operated under substantial unification, absent said statute, given their location, nature, and experience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners sought review of a decision of a trial court of Pemiscot County (Missouri), which fixed the landowners' damages in a condemnation suit at an amount representing the difference between the original deposit into the registry of the court and the amount awarded by the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the landowners' property was condemned, state officials determined the just compensation and deposited that amount into the registry of the court. A jury later awarded the landowners a greater amount, and the court entered judgment for the landowners for the difference between the amount of the State's award and the jury's determination of the damages. On appeal, the landowners contended that the trial court erred in refusing to amend its judgment nunc pro tunc because they were entitled to recover interest on the difference. The appellate court agreed and held that the court should have calculated the interest and added it to the jury's award. However, the court noted that the landowners did not plead or ask the court for an allowance of interest. The court held that the failure to enter judgment for the interest was either judicial error or simply an oversight, neither of which was the subject of correction by judgment nunc pro tunc. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the failure to add interest was not an error in calculation but a failure to make the calculation and addition and that therefore the trial court did not err in refusing to make the amendment.</SPAN></P>
