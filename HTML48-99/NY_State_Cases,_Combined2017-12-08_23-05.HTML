</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from judgment of the Oneida County Court (New York) rendered upon a verdict convicting defendant of promoting sexual performance by a child and attempted dissemination of indecent materials to minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of promoting sexual performance by a child and attempted dissemination of indecent materials to minors. Defendant's convictions were based on his contact with an undercover police officer over the Internet. The officer pretended to be a minor and defendant attempted to recruit the fictional young girl for illicit sex. Defendant also sent the undercover officer sexually explicit materials containing pictures of minors having sex with adults. On appeal, defendant contended that the statute under which he was convicted was vague and overbroad and violated the Commerce Clause. The court held that the statute was narrowly tailored to accomplish the legislature's objectives. Further, the state had a compelling interest in protecting children from exposure to sexually explicit materials. The court held that the statute in question had no Commerce Clause implications. Defendant's convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for promoting sexual performance by a child and attempted dissemination of indecent materials to minors were affirmed, and the court upheld the statute under which he was convicted. The court held that the statute was not impermissibly vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Overbreadth </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Penal Law &sect; 235.22, disseminating indecent material to minors, is not unconstitutionally overbroad, but is a precise means of protecting children from high-tech cybersex abuse and actual sexual abuse, since under the statute, adults may send sexual images to another adult, and may also invite that adult to engage in sexual relations without risking prosecution under the statute; it is only when an individual sends graphic images to a minor and then attempts to lure that minor into sexual activity does he risk conviction under the statute.  Because of the two-pronged nature of the statute, communication between adults would not be chilled.  Moreover, the statute defines what graphic images would be &quot;harmful to minors&quot; and proscribes specific acts by individuals.  Although one may imagine instances in which the statute could be unconstitutionally applied, those situations would not occur with such frequency that the statute should be considered overbroad, and whatever overbreadth might exist can be cured by a case-by-case analysis.  Any impermissible applications of the statute would represent only a tiny fraction of the conduct within the statute's reach and, thus, the overbreadth is not substantial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Vagueness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Penal Law &sect; 235.22, disseminating indecent material to minors, is not unconstitutionally vague because it employs the terms &quot;sexual contact&quot;, &quot;importunes, invites or induces&quot;, &quot;sexual conduct&quot;, and &quot;harmful to minors&quot;.  &quot;Sexual contact&quot;, while not defined in the statute, is defined elsewhere in the Penal Law as &quot;any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married to the actor for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire of either party.  It includes the touching of the actor by the victim, as well as the touching of the victim by the actor, whether directly or through clothing&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 130.00 [3]).  In addition, the meaning of &quot;sexual contact&quot; can be inferred from the other prohibited conduct, i.e., sexual intercourse and deviate sexual intercourse. The terms &quot;importunes, invites or induces&quot; are common terms with common ordinary meanings.  &quot;Sexual conduct&quot; is defined as &quot;acts of masturbation, homosexuality, sexual intercourse, or physical contact with a person's clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area, buttocks or, if such person be a female, breast&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 235.20 [3]).  All the terms within that definition are commonly used terms and are not vague.  Finally, &quot;harmful to minors&quot; is defined in Penal Law &sect; 235.20 (6) and has been held sufficient to give adequate notice to individuals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Content-Based Restriction </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Penal Law &sect; 235.22, disseminating indecent material to minors, is intended to protect children from the primary effects of the transmission of offensive speech and, thus, is a content-based restriction on speech.  However, it is well settled that a State's interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor is compelling, and in light of the two-pronged nature of the statute, which requires both the sending of graphic images to a minor and the attempt to lure that minor into sexual activity, the statute is a precisely drawn means of serving a compelling interest and is no broader than necessary.  Accordingly, it is constitutional under the First Amendment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Commerce Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The purpose of Penal Law &sect; 235.22, disseminating indecent material to minors, is to protect children who use the Internet from the primary effects of the transmission of offensive speech, and not to regulate commerce; it is not an economic protectionist measure, but rather is directed at a legitimate local concern.  The requirement in the statute that a defendant lure his victim into sexual activity narrows its scope and lessens any burden on commerce. The court cannot conceive of any legitimate commerce involving the sending of graphic images to minors while at the same time attempting to lure them into engaging in sexual activity. Accordingly, any incidental effects that section 235.22 may have on commerce are not unduly burdensome in relation to the compelling interest of the State in protecting children, and thus it does not violate the commerce clause of the US Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Sufficiency of Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a prosecution arising from defendant's use of the Internet on his personal computer, Penal Law &sect; 235.22, disseminating indecent material to minors, does not require the People to prove that defendant intended his communication to be received by a minor.  Defendant's conviction under Penal Law &sect; 263.15 for promoting a sexual performance by a child, was based on legally sufficient evidence and the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence where the People submitted sufficient proof that the graphic images sent by defendant were pictures of actual children and had not been altered; the jury had the pictures before it to review, and its determination that the pictures represented actual children is supported by the record.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Witnesses - Cross-Examination </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a prosecution arising from defendant's use of the Internet on his personal computer in attempting to arrange a sexual encounter with a State Trooper posing as a minor, the court did not improperly restrict the cross-examination of the Trooper regarding his alcohol addiction since it would be improper to so cross-examine the Trooper where such alcohol use had no relation to his ability to recall or perceive the events in question.  The court also properly denied defense counsel access to the Trooper's personnel file after an in camera inspection thereof revealed that it contained no exculpatory material, and even if the material should have been disclosed, there is no reasonable possibility that the failure to disclose contributed to the verdict.  Moreover, the court properly admitted a computer disk containing the images sent by defendant, and the conversations between the Trooper, who posed as a 15-year-old girl, and defendant, since the contents of the disk were unique and the Trooper was able to authenticate it.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the County Court of Chemung County (New York), which convicted defendant of promoting prison contraband in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a prison inmate, was found in possession of a sharpened metal lid of a can with part of it wrapped in electrical tape, and charged with promoting prison contraband in the first degree. The lower court denied defendant's motion to vacate the conviction. The court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 205.25 and the Department of Correctional Services Standards of Inmate Behavior were unconstitutionally vague. Both the statute and the inmate rules pertaining to contraband made provided adequate warning and were sufficiently clear to inform a reasonable person of the nature of the offense prohibited. Defendant's failure to admit that the contraband was dangerous did not render defendant's guilty plea invalid. Defendant's recitation of the facts did not cast doubt upon his guilt, the voluntariness of his plea or negate an element of the crime charged. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim and his claim that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was denied were without merit. There was only a five-month delay between the time of the offense and presentation to the grand jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision, finding that state law and inmate rules concerning contraband were not unconstitutionally vague because both provided adequate warning to inform a reasonable person of the nature of the offense charged. Defendant's failure to admit all the facts did not render defendant's guilty plea invalid, because defendant's version of the facts did not cast doubt upon his guilt.</SPAN></P>

The plaintiff had to establish such bad faith or illegal reasons and conclusory allegations of bad faith were insufficient to meet this burden or to warrant a hearing.

Petitioner had contended that he could not be removed from the position of detective pursuant to N.Y. Civ. Serv.

Petitioner was not entitled to the benefits of 1997 N.Y. Laws 134, because the statute applied only to those people who performed investigative duties and not to those people, like petitioner, who worked in supervisory capacities. Further, the Rockland County Police Act took precedence over inconsistent provisions of the New York Civil Service Law and, under the Act, police chiefs had authority to revoke detective assignments at any time. Finally, the right to permanent appointment to a detective position under N.Y. Civ. Serv.

Declaratory relief is available in cases where, as here, the constitutionality or legality of a statute or regulation is in question and no question of fact is involved.  In this case, where the constitutionality of the &quot;public charge&quot; regulation has been implicated, the nature and purpose of the regulation sought to be tested is not disputed and the only questions involved are those of law, equity should not hesitate to define the rights of the parties.  Accordingly, there is no basis to disturb the order granting injunctive relief. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action challenging the constitutionality of the &quot;public charge&quot; regulation governing medical assistance payments to personal care services providers (18 NYCRR 505.14 [h] [7] [ii]) in which plaintiff, the operator of a licensed home care agency enrolled in the Medicaid program, sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the regulation, Supreme Court, after granting a preliminary injunction enjoining any criminal prosecution of plaintiff for violating the regulation, properly held defendant Attorney General in civil contempt for submitting charges to a Grand Jury and obtaining an indictment against plaintiff despite the clear mandate of the order granting the preliminary injunction. Such order explicitly enjoined criminal prosecution of plaintiff in order to protect plaintiff's equitable rights and to avoid irreversible injury to it &quot;as a result of prosecution&quot;.  Until judicial relief to stay or vacate the order was successfully obtained, defendant was duty-bound to honor it.  Moreover, filing a notice of appeal from Supreme Court's order did not invoke the automatic stay provisions of CPLR 5519 (a) (1) as to cloak defendant with legal protection from the subsequent contempt. A prohibitory injunction, which operates to restrain the commission or continuance of an act and to prevent a threatened injury, thereby ordinarily having the effect of maintaining the status quo, is not automatically stayed under CPLR 5519 (a) (1).  To countenance defendant's position that CPLR 5519 (a) (1) permitted a criminal prosecution to go forward in its ordinary course would not maintain the status quo and would make any decision in plaintiff's favor in the underlying action barren.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioner appealed and the court reversed, reinstated the petitions, and awarded judgments of possession to petitioner.

</DIV>

Law &sect; 345 seeking the invalidation of a contingent reverter in a deed.

Plaintiff urged that defendant's failure to record a declaration of intention to preserve the reverter, as required by N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 345, extinguished it. The lower court denied summary judgment on the basis that &sect; 345 was unconstitutional as applied to a reversionary interest which did not mature until after the applicable recording deadline. Because there was a factual dispute as to when plaintiff ceased using the property as a motherhouse, the appellate court ruled that summary judgment was properly denied because it could not be determined whether defendant's reversionary interest matured prior to the deadline for recording a declaration.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner public utility sought review of a determination by the Tax Appeals Tribunal (New York), which denied its claim for a refund of a corporation tax assessment imposed under N.Y. Tax Law art. 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a public utility that sold natural gas to residential and commercial customers in New York. Petitioner sought a partial refund of its gross receipts tax imposed under N.Y. Tax Law art. 9. The Division of Taxation and Finance denied petitioner's request, on the basis that the deduction was not allowable under Tax Law art. 9 since by statutory construction, gross receipts taxes were not taxes imposed on customers and, therefore remained includable in the corporation's gross earnings. Petitioner's challenge to the denial was rejected by an Administrative Law Judge whose determination was upheld by respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal on administrative appeal. The court confirmed the Tribunal's determination, concluding it was not arbitrary and capricious nor an abuse of discretion. Petitioner failed to prove that the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax, imposed by Tax Law art. 9, shifted to consumers after adoption of the gas import tax. While the economic burden of the gross receipts tax and gas import tax fell on the consumer, the gross receipts tax statutes explicitly imposed the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax on utilities. N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 186, 186-a.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Determination denying petitioner's claim for a refund of a corporation tax assessment confirmed without costs and petition dismissed because petitioner failed to prove that the enactment of the gas import tax required the court to shift the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax from gas utilities to customers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Gross Receipts Tax on Natural Gas Sales - Effect of Enactment of Gas Import Tax on Utility's Right to Partial Refund </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The determination of respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal that petitioner, a public utility involved in the sale of natural gas, was not entitled to a partial refund for gross receipts taxes imposed on its gas sales within New York because the enactment of a separate gas import tax in 1991 (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 189), requiring gas utilities to remit to the State import tax revenues collected from certain gas consumers, did not effect a shift in the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax to gas consumers as to make the pass through of gross receipts tax recoupment to gas customers deductible in the calculation of petitioner's gross earnings, was not arbitrary and capricious nor an abuse of discretion and should therefore be confirmed.  The gas import tax was crafted with the legal incidence of the tax on gas importers, with the utility operating as the collection agent for the State in a manner analogous to sales tax collection. Since the legal incidence of the gas import tax falls on the gas importer rather than the utility, State tax regulations allow petitioner to exclude gas import tax collections from corporate taxable receipts when calculating the amount of gross receipts taxes owed.  In contrast, the gross receipts tax is explicitly imposed upon utilities and is considered part of each utilities' operating costs (Tax Law &sect; 186-a [6]).  Moreover, in further contrast to the gas import tax, the gross receipts tax and surcharge statutes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect;&sect; 186, 186-b, 186-c, 188) make no reference to the utility acting as a &quot;trustee&quot; for collection purposes, thereby indicating that the Legislature did not intend to hold gas consumers liable for nonpayment of the utility's gross receipts taxes.  Lastly, petitioner lacks standing to assert that the gas import tax will be rendered unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause if the Tribunal's determination is upheld.  Petitioner's claim for a partial refund of its gross receipts tax does not properly place the constitutionality of the gas import tax before the Appellate Division.  Accordingly, the petition seeking a review of respondent's determination should be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

A contract provision in a collective bargaining agreement could modify, supplement, or replace the more traditional forms of protection afforded public employees. Such a waiver of statutory rights in disciplinary matters was not against public policy, and members of the bargaining unit were bound thereby.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner assistant deputy superintendent of the state police appealed the decision of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), dismissing his application for review of respondent comptroller of the state of New York's determination that petitioner had to retire from his position because he reached 57 years of age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner, a state police assistant deputy superintendent, joined the special pension and retirement program for state police officers, N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 381-b(e) provided that the mandatory retirement age for an assistant deputy superintendent was 60 years of age. Then, the law was changed to fix a uniform mandatory retirement age of 57 for all state police officers. When petitioner turned 57, respondent comptroller of the state of New York determined that he had to retire pursuant to the amended &sect; 381-b(e). Petitioner sought review of respondent's decision, contending that the amended law violated the Nonimpairment Clause of N.Y. Const. art V, &sect; 7 because the law shortened his term of employment by three years. The application was dismissed. Petitioner appealed the dismissal of his application for review. The appeals court affirmed the dismissal because the fact that there could be no constitutional impairment of pension system benefits did not create a constitutional right to stay in public employment for any specified period of time. Moreover, the court found the change in the mandatory retirement age was enacted to further a legitimate public policy goal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of petitioner's application for review of the determination that he had to retire because he was 57 years of age was affirmed because, although the Nonimpairment Clause of the N.Y. Const. prohibited the impairment of pension system benefits, this prohibition did not create a constitutional right for petitioner to stay in public employment for any specified period of time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Mandatory Retirement of Members of State Police - No Unconstitutional Impairment of Pension Benefits </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petitioner, who attained his position as Assistant Deputy Superintendent with the Division of State Police in 1994 at the age of 55, was properly required to retire at the conclusion of the year in which he attained age 57 in accordance with Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 381-b (e) (as amended by L 1988, ch 759), notwithstanding the fact that when he became a member of the 20-year special pension and retirement program for State Police in 1969 the statute provided an extended mandatory retirement age of 60 for members holding certain high-ranking positions within the Division of State Police, including petitioner's position.  The application of the 1988 amendment establishing the uniform mandatory retirement age of 57 for all members of the State Police to petitioner did not unconstitutionally diminish or impair petitioner's contractual rights in the pension system in violation of the Nonimpairment Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art V, &sect; 7).  The fact that there can be no constitutional impairment of pension system benefits does not create a constitutional right to stay in public employment nor does the Nonimpairment Clause prohibit the State from establishing mandatory retirement ages.  The subject change in the mandatory retirement age was enacted to further a legitimate public policy goal.  Petitioner merely seeks to extend the term of his public employment, thereby effecting but a &quot;minor and entirely incidental&quot; influence on his retirement benefits. Accordingly, the petition challenging petitioner's involuntary retirement was properly dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff executive officer challenged an order of the Supreme Court in Albany County (New York), which dismissed his complaint against defendants, Commissioner of New York Department of Taxation and Finance, Deputy Commissioner, and outside counsel, that sought a declaration that the payment of legal fees for the performance of certain collection services constituted a misappropriation of state funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Effort to collect unpaid taxes by the New York Department of Taxation and Finance proved unsuccessful against plaintiff executive officer's company. Defendants, Commissioner of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance and Deputy Commissioner, decided to retain defendant outside counsel to represent it in the enforcement proceedings. The attorney general and the comptroller executed and approved the retainer agreement. Plaintiff challenged this decision, and the trial court dismissed his complaint. On appeal, plaintiff argued that defendants, commissioner and deputy commission, had no authority to retain defendant outside counsel to pursue collection matters against plaintiff's company and that the attorney general's authority in this regard could not be delegated. The court held that the language in N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 1414(a), 1449(1) was sufficiently broad to permit the attorney general to retain outside counsel to perform enforcement and collection services. While the language in N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 692(h) was not as expansive, it did not preclude the attorney general from retaining outside counsel to pursue enforcement mechanisms as to taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. While plaintiff has standing as a citizen-taxpayer pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b to challenge the State's payment of legal fees to outside counsel to collect certain unpaid taxes and penalties owed by plaintiff and his corporation as a misappropriation of State funds, the standing conferred by the statute does not extend to any challenge to the process by which outside counsel was retained.  Plaintiff's improper delegation claim does not in any way implicate the wrongful expenditure, misappropriation or misapplication of State funds.  In addition, since the Attorney-General essentially ratified the actions of respondent State Tax Commissioner by granting oral approval of the underlying arrangement and then by executing the retainer agreement, which was approved by the Comptroller, plaintiff's challenge to the process employed in retaining outside counsel is academic.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Enforcement - Retention of Outside Counsel to Engage in Collection Services </SPAN></P>

As to the real property transfer gains taxes and real estate transfer taxes owed, the relevant statutory provisions authorizing the Attorney-General, upon the request of the Tax Commission, to &quot;bring or cause to be brought&quot; an action to enforce payment of the taxes imposed (Tax Law former &sect; 1449 [1]; &sect; 1414 [a]) are sufficiently broad to permit the Attorney-General to retain outside counsel to perform enforcement and collection services.  Furthermore, while the language contained in Tax Law &sect; 692 (h) with regard to the collection of the personal income taxes owed is not as expansive, that statute cannot be read as precluding the Attorney-General from retaining outside counsel to pursue available enforcement mechanisms with respect to the personal income taxes owed. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimants challenged a decision of the Court of Claims (New York), which held that the claimants had to establish they were treated differently than a non-minority group in a similar situation to prevail on their race-based equal protection claims. Defendant State challenged a decision declaring the litigation a class action and determining that claimants who filed a claim but not a notice of claim met the jurisdictional requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police received a report that a woman had been attacked by an African-American male and determined that the assailant may have cut his hand or forearm. They stopped African-American males in and around the city, checking for the injury. The claimants commenced a constitutional tort action, alleging the actions of the police were racially motivated. The claims court set forth the standard of proof and declared the suit a class action. The court found that the claims court properly tolled the statute of limitations based on its earlier dismissal of the claims, which dismissal was reversed, and that the notices of intention to file a claim qualified as claims. Further, the claimants satisfied all the requisite criteria for a class action as common questions of law and fact with respect to liability predominated over questions affecting only individual class members. The claims court erred, however, in imposing the wrong burden of proof on the claimants as discriminatory enforcement was established as a matter of law and the strict scrutiny test placed the burden on the State to prove that the means used in the investigation were necessary to promote a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - What Statute Governs - Constitutional Tort Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The three-year Statute of Limitations for personal injury actions ( CPLR 214 [5]) applies to a constitutional tort claim against the State, in which claimants allege that the conduct of law enforcement officials in singling out all the African-American students enrolled at a State college for questioning about a knife-point assault was racially motivated.  The Court of Appeals has held that a civil rights claim brought under 42 USC &sect; 1983 is governed by the three-year limitations period for personal injury actions and the same Statute of Limitations is appropriate for a constitutional tort under the State Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - Tolling - Constitutional Tort Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Statute of Limitations for a constitutional tort claim against the State, in which claimants allege that the conduct of law enforcement officials in singling out all the African-American students enrolled at a State college for questioning about a knife-point assault was racially motivated, should be tolled where the Court of Claims initially dismissed the claim on the merits on the ground that constitutional torts are not cognizable in the Court of Claims and the claim was thereafter reinstated on appeal by the Court of Appeals.  Under these circumstances, the Court of Claims properly tolled the Statute of Limitations for the reinstated claim because filing the claim within the applicable two-year period (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Court of Claims Act &sect; 10 [3]) would have been meaningless in light of its prior order which had dismissed the claim.  While a court may not extend a Statute of Limitations or invent tolling principles, the Court of Claims in this case appropriately applied the common-law doctrine that the Statute of Limitations is tolled where the limitations would run against a person unable to bring an action based on a prior ruling.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Claim against State - Notice of Intention to File Claim - Notice of Intention Treated as Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The Court of Claims properly determined in a constitutional tort claim against the State, in which claimants allege that the conduct of law enforcement officials in singling out all the African-American students enrolled at a State college for questioning about a knife-point assault was racially motivated, that those claimants who filed notices of intention to file a claim but who did not timely file a notice of claim met the jurisdictional filing requirements of Court of Claims Act &sect; 10 (8), which provides that &quot;a claimant who timely serves and files a notice of intention but who fails to timely serve or file a claim may, nevertheless, apply to the court for permission to treat the notice of intention as a claim.&quot; The Court of Claims may treat a notice of intention to file a claim as a notice of claim as long as the notice of intention adequately sets forth the time and place and as long as the State is not prejudiced by an omission.  Here, the notice of intention states that the rights of each individual were violated in or near the college campus during a five-day period.  Moreover, the State has been aware of the lawsuit, has been investigating the incidents since shortly after they occurred and the issues related to liability are generally identical with respect to each claimant. The State has thus not been deceived or misled and its rights have not been prejudiced. Accordingly, the notices of intention to file a claim qualify as claims.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Class Actions - Constitutional Tort Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. A constitutional tort claim against the State, in which claimants allege that the conduct of law enforcement officials in singling out all the African-American students enrolled at a State college for questioning about a knife-point assault was racially motivated, meets the statutory prerequisites for class certification.  The Court of Claims properly exercised its discretion in concluding that claimants satisfied all the requisite criteria detailed in CPLR 901 (a) since common questions of law and fact with respect to the issue of liability are substantial and predominate over any questions affecting only individual members of the class.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Matters Appealable - Standard of Proof Determination in Constitutional Tort Claim - &quot;Law of the Case&quot; Doctrine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> determination of the Court of Claims with respect to the standard of proof ultimately to be applied at trial of a constitutional tort claim against the State, in which claimants allege that the conduct of law enforcement officials in singling out all the African-American students enrolled at a State college for questioning about a knife-point assault was racially motivated, is appealable under the &quot;law of the case&quot; doctrine.  The court determined that claimants must demonstrate that they were treated differently than a similarly situated nonminority group.  Where, as here, a court directly passes upon an issue which is necessarily involved in the final determination on the merits, it becomes &quot;the law of the case&quot; and is appealable. In addition, the issue of what must be proven by claimants in order for them to prevail on their equal protection claim is more than advisory, it is a decision which directly relates to the final determination of the merits of this case and, as such, affects a substantial right of claimants; it is therefore appealable (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 5701 [a] [2] [v]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torts - Constitutional Tort - Burden of Proof </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. The Court of Claims erred in determining that the standard of proof in a trial of a constitutional tort claim against the State, in which claimants allege that the conduct of law enforcement officials in singling out all the African-American students enrolled at a State college for questioning about a knife-point assault was racially motivated, requires that claimants establish that they were treated differently than a nonminority group in a similar situation in order to prevail on their equal protection claim. Since the State has admitted that each person was stopped on the basis of race alone, discriminatory enforcement is established as a matter of law.  Consequently, claimants, in proving their cause of action, should not be held to the &quot;formidable task&quot; of demonstrating that they were treated differently than a similarly situated nonminority group.  Rather, the proper standard for the Court of Claims to apply is the strict scrutiny test, which places the burden on the State to prove that the means used in the investigation were necessary to promote a compelling State interest.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an inmate, pleaded guilty to attempted promoting prison contraband and waived his right to appeal all issues except for sentencing. After sentencing defendant sought review, arguing that the waiver was not made knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily, that he was denied effective counsel, and the statutes under which he was convicted were unconstitutional. On appeal the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that defendant's contentions that his waiver was not knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily made and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel had not been preserved for review because he had not made a motion to vacate or withdraw his plea. The court nonetheless found that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to appeal after being advised of his rights and the consequences of the waiver, and that defendant received meaningful representation from which he received the benefit of an advantageous plea agreement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought to set aside two contracts for the collection of solid waste entered into between respondent waste management authority and two correctional facilities upon the ground that respondent lacked the statutory authority to enter into the contracts. Petitioner argued that respondent exercised its power solely by legislative grant, and absent an express legislative delegation of power, its actions were ultra vires and void. It contended that N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 2051-e(9) authorized respondent to contract with state agencies for the purpose of receiving, treating, and disposing of solid waste but omitted the word collecting from the enumerated powers, leaving respondent without authority to enter into underlying contracts with facilities for collection of waste. The appellate court held that interpreting &sect; 2051-e (9) in that fashion would have effectively nullified those provisions of the statute authorizing respondent to collect solid waste in the first instance. The court ruled that the authority to contract with the state or its agencies for such services was found in N.Y. Pub. Auth.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners claimed that rezoning of property was unconstitutional, and dismissal of their complaints was in error as they each had standing and had met all requirements of the preliminary injunction. The court disagreed. The court found that one of the landowners failed to specifically allege actions which were sufficient to demonstrate that the harm it would have suffered upon rezoning, would have been different from that of the public at large. It said that unless the allegations were contained in the complaint, no standing was found and dismissal was proper. However, the landowners' allegations of traffic congestion and its consequential increase in noise were potential noneconomic environmental concerns within the zone of interest which established standing to challenge the enactment of Local Law No. 22. Accordingly, the court reinstated the landowners' complaints. The court said that the zoning board only had to prove the zoning amendment was adopted for a legitimate governmental purpose and that there was a reasonable relation between the end sought, and the means used to achieve that end in order for the rezoning to withstand attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the candidates argued that the statute was unconstitutional because the requirement that an independent nominating petition include the town or city in which each signor or subscribing witness resided, imposed an undue burden upon the electoral process. The appellate court held that the town or city requirement imposed by N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 6-140 was not unconstitutional. Strict compliance with the town or city requirement served the legitimate purpose of facilitating the discovery of fraud and allowed the rapid and efficient verification of signatures within the restrictive time periods imposed by the Election Law. Moreover, the reasonable, nondiscriminatory requirement imposed by the statute did not restrict access to the State ballot or place an unconstitutional burden on the candidates' U.S. Const. amend.

The town filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and the trial court granted the motion. The citizen sought review, and the court affirmed on appeal.

Thus, the court found that the citizen's claim was capable of being resolved pursuant to a N.Y.

The public-assistance recipients alleged that their work conditions exposed them to possible death or serious physical harm. The public-assistance recipients did not avail themselves of the administrative procedures set forth in New York's Labor Law. Therefore, the court found that dismissal was procedurally required. The public-assistance recipients were required to exhaust all possibilities of obtaining relief through administrative channels before appealing to the courts. Although there were exceptions to that rule, including when an agency action was unconstitutional, or when an agency went wholly beyond its grant of power, or when resort to an administrative remedy would have been futile, none of the exceptions applied to the public-assistance recipients. In addition, injunctive relief was not warranted when there was no fact-finding done to support that form of relief.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the majority of the revenues of facilities that had a large Medicaid population were not subject to the additional assessments, while RHCFs that had a large proportion of gross receipts from non-Medicaid sources, shouldered the burden of the assessments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Act, the authority was authorized to issue bonds to fund capital improvement projects in the city. The authority's primary resource was personal income taxes. The taxpayers filed a declaratory judgment action against the state. The trial court allowed the city and the authority to intervene. The trial court granted summary judgment to the state, the city, and the authority. The court affirmed. The court held that to the extent that the taxpayers contended that the Act's financing scheme ran afoul of N.Y. Const. art.

The court found that the payments made to the authority under the Act were permissible gifts and did not obligate either the city or the state to repay any debt incurred by the authority. The taxpayers failed to meet their heavy burden of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that, pursuant to the Act, the state and city were legally obligated to the holders of the bonds in the event of the authority's default and, thus, incurred debt in contravention of the relevant constitutional mandates.</SPAN></P>

In an action challenging the constitutionality of the New York City Transitional Finance Authority Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 2799-aa </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), Supreme Court erred in concluding that voter standing should be limited only to those plaintiffs who reside in New York City.  While it is true that plaintiffs allege that the Act is nothing more than an elaborate attempt to evade the constitutional limitations on debt incursion imposed upon the City by NY Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 4, plaintiffs' over-all challenge to the Act is much broader in scope.  Thus, to the extent that plaintiffs contend that the financing scheme imposed by the Act runs afoul of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 11 and deprives them of a State-wide public referendum in this regard, each plaintiff here should be afforded voter standing on that basis; such standing does not, however, extend to plaintiffs' claims that the Act violates NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8 (gift or loan of State money or credit), article VIII, &sect; 12 (limits upon local indebtedness) or article X, &sect; 5 (restriction on assumption of obligations of a public corporation), as such provisions are not linked to any voting rights.  Moreover, plaintiffs' arguments that they have citizen-taxpayer standing pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b are without merit since it is clear that regardless of the manner in which plaintiffs' claims are styled, they essentially are challenging the validity of the Authority's issuance of bonds to fund capital improvements projects identified in New York City, and the plain language of section 123-b precludes standing under such circumstances.  </SPAN></P>

In an action challenging the constitutionality of the New York City Transitional Finance Authority Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 2799-aa </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), plaintiffs' constitutional claims are premised upon the erroneous belief that any debt incurred by the Authority pursuant to the Act is a debt of the State and the City.  The basis for this belief is plaintiffs' assertion that the State and City are obligated, through the payments made to the Authority by the Comptroller, to fund the debt service on the bonds issued by the Authority.  Plaintiffs' argument on this point, however, ignores not only the plain language of Public Authorities Law &sect; 2799-gg (10) and &sect; 2799-ii, but also the decisions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Wein v City of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (36 NY2d 610) and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Schulz v State of New York</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (84 NY2d 231, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">cert denied</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;513 US 1127), which are entirely dispositive of this matter.

Although an individual is stigmatized by being branded as a child abuser, and is stigmatized when an indicated report of abuse or maltreatment is placed on the Central Register, because prospective employers have access to the list, there is not the same level of stigma (if any) attached to the maintenance of sealed unfounded reports.  Furthermore, the concern about future potential employers is not implicated because such employers only have access to indicated reports.  In any event, even if there is a stigma attached by merely maintaining such reports as unfounded and sealed in the Central Register, petitioners herein did not demonstrate that the &quot;plus&quot; requirement of the &quot;stigma plus&quot; test, which requires a tangible element in addition to damage to one's good name, has been met in that there has been no specific deprivation of an employment opportunity.  </SPAN></P>

Maintaining the sealed, unfounded reports for purposes of subsequent investigations by the Department of Social Services is rationally related to the community interest of improving the safety of children in both family and institutional settings.

To the extent that petitioners argue that the only fair way to apply these amendments would be to do so retroactively, this argument not only raises notice issues as to those individuals, but would also be impossible to administer in that all prior unfounded reports were destroyed. Speculation as to the consequences in the event that the Act is illegally administered cannot satisfy petitioners' burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted 1997 N.Y. Laws 390 as its third attempt to create a school district providing special education services to the children of a Hasidic community after two previous statutes had been held to violate U.S. Const. amend. I. The citizen taxpayers filed an action against two boards of education, state officials, and state agencies alleging that ch. 390 violated the Establishment Clause. The boards of education appealed from the denial of their motion for a change of venue and the boards, officials and agencies appealed from an order granting the citizen taxpayers' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed both orders. The venue order was within the trial court's discretion because there were conflicting statutory provisions controlling venue. Chapter 390 was not a neutral law curing the constitutional deficiencies of its predecessors. It applied to only two of the state's 1,545 municipalities and the likelihood that it would apply to other municipalities in the future was remote at best. Despite its facial neutrality, the statute was unconstitutional because its primary effect was to endorse the religious beliefs of the residents of the challenged district.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Supreme Court, Albany County, did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants' motion for a change of venue to Orange County where plaintiffs, as citizen-taxpayers, are challenging the constitutionality of a State statute establishing a school district which would primarily, if not solely, benefit a sect of Hasidic Jews.  There are conflicting statutory provisions: actions against school boards shall be brought in the county where the school district is located ( CPLR 504 [2]); however, State Finance Law &sect; 123-c (1) requires that a citizen taxpayer's challenge be brought either where the disbursement of funds occurred or is likely to occur or where the State official has his or her principal office; and CPLR 509 states that venue, unless changed, shall be in the county chosen by the plaintiff.  Here, five of the eight named defendants are State agencies or State officials with principal offices in Albany County, and plaintiffs chose Albany County.  Accordingly, Supreme Court did not abuse its discretion in denying a change of venue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Establishment of Religion - Validity of Statute Permitting Creation of School District Solely within Municipality to Meet Required Educational Needs - Governmental Neutrality </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Chapter 390 of the Laws of 1997, which is the latest in a series of attempts to create a school district which would provide special educational services to a sect of Hasidic Jews, is not a neutral law which cured the constitutional deficiencies of its predecessors, since it lacks the neutralitytoward religion mandated by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Chapter 390 applies to only two of the State's 1,545 municipalities and, thus, can hardly be said to be a truly religious-neutral law of general applicability available to a broad array of eligible municipalities. Moreover not only does the new statute apply to too few existing municipalities, its application to other municipalities in the future is speculative: despite provisions which extend the benefits of the statute to existing municipalities for which conditions may change in the future and to new municipalities yet to be formed, the &quot;theoretical possibility&quot; that other municipalities may qualify under the new statute in the future is remote at best.  A review of the history of this legislation leads to the conclusion that chapter 390, as its predecessors, clearly provides an impermissible preference to the religious community in response to its desire to provide its handicapped children with special education services in an exclusively sectarian environment.  Accordingly, chapter 390, despite its facial neutrality, violates the second, &quot;endorsement&quot;, prong of the test set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lemon v Kurtzman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (403 US 602) as its primary effect endorses the sect's religious beliefs.  </SPAN></P>

The court also held that the regulation was consistent with the statutory mandate and the DOH did not exceed its authority in authorizing a reallocation based upon a percentage change in need, rather than an actual change in need. The court deferred to the interpretation of the DOH and determined that the interpretations made were consistent with legislative intent and the policy underlying the regulation. The court concluded that the DOH made the requisite annual reviews and definitive findings as required.

A portion of the regulation promulgated by respondent Department of Health (DOH) of the State of New York regarding Medicaid hospital reimbursement for bad debts and the costs of charity care (10 NYCRR 86-1.11 [g] [7]; [p] [7]) is neither unconstitutional nor contrary to the enabling statutes (Public Health Law &sect; 2807-a [8] [e]; &sect; 2808-c [4] [e]); moreover, DOH's implementation of that regulation is not arbitrary and capricious, or contrary to law.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A maintenance of effort (MOE) regulation (10 NYCRR 86-1.11 [g] [7]), which is designed to encourage general hospitals to maintain their efforts at providing care to those unable or unwilling to pay for care and to discourage hospitals from shifting the financial burdens associated with bad debt and charity care (BDCC) to other hospitals by authorizing the State Department of Health (DOH) to reallocate regional pool funds if it finds that there has been a change in the proportional amount of BDCC need provided by the hospitals, is neither unconstitutional nor invalid on the ground that it retroactively establishes Medicaid reimbursement rates in violation of Public Health Law &sect; 2807 (7).  The initial BDCC allocation, which is part of the reimbursement rate for inpatient services of each general hospital for the rate years 1983 and 1984, was established prior to each rate year based upon the amount of the hospital's BDCC need as indicated by each hospital's financial and statistical data for base year 1981.  The reallocation scheme implemented by the MOE regulation does not set the reimbursement rate; it is an adjustment of the rate based upon the effort of each hospital in maintaining its level of inpatient services provided to BDCC patients during the rate year.  Adjustments to an established rate that are contemplated by the statutory reimbursement scheme do not constitute impermissible retroactive rate-making.  Moreover, the MOE regulation did not operate retroactively: it was promulgated in March 1984, and because each hospital is not required to submit its financial and statistical data regarding the cost of providing inpatient services until the first of May of the year following the rate year, DOH could not begin the process of conducting an annual review to determine whether a reallocation is warranted for rate year 1983 until after May 1, 1994; thus, no step in the reallocation process was undertaken until well after promulgation of the 1984 MOE regulation. </SPAN></P>

The statutory reimbursement methodologies are neither clear nor unambiguous insofar as they appear to require definitive findings based on proportional changes in BDCC services provided and it cannot be said that the regulation is invalid because it requires findings based on changes in BDCC need.  Because the object of the annual review is BDCC &quot;need&quot; and the definitive findings must be based upon the annual review, the meaning of the word &quot;provided&quot; is unclear; BDCC services &quot;provided&quot; is not the subject of the annual review and could not be the basis of the definitive finding mandated by the statutes.  Rather, the statutory language should be construed to require definitive findings based upon proportional changes in BDCC need provided.  </SPAN></P>

Based on the involvement of the Council in the development of the statutory methodologies and the knowledge of the Council and DOH of the methodology involved in the operational practices of allocating and reallocating BDCC pool funds, courts should defer to their interpretation of the statute since they are the agencies responsible for development and administration of the statute, and their interpretation is not unreasonable or irrational.  </SPAN></P>

Thus, with respect to intersector and intrasector reallocation, the statutes are ambiguous.  Accordingly, courts should defer to the interpretation of the Council on Health Care Financing and Commissioner of Health, since their interpretation, as reflected in the MOE regulations, is consistent with legislative intent and the policy underlying the concept of maintenance of effort.  Reallocating BDCC pool funds only between sectors would not accomplish that purpose and would not discourage private hospitals from shifting the BDCC burden to other private hospitals.  In those regions without a major public hospital, there would be no reallocation at all; hospitals in those regions, therefore, would be treated differently from hospitals in regions that included a major public hospital.  Thus, the decision to include intrasector reallocation is not irrational and should be upheld.  </SPAN></P>

There is no requirement that the reviews be conducted annually; rather, the annual review requirement is satisfied by conducting a separate review for each rate year once adequate data essential to such a review becomes available.  Further, the statutes do not specify the form or manner in which definitive findings must be made.  DOH disseminated data in 1994 to each hospital showing proportional changes for each rate year in the amount of BDCC provided by that hospital and other hospitals in the region as well as proportional changes between the public and private hospital sectors; although not labeled &quot;definitive findings&quot;, such data constitute the requisite definitive findings.  Although plaintiffs maintain that the failure of DOH to respond to Freedom of Information Law requests and discovery demands for production of definitive findings establishes that no such findings exist, the failure of DOH to respond is attributable to its position that there is no discrete document entitled &quot;definitive findings&quot; and does not constitute a concession that such findings do not exist.  </SPAN></P>

In a challenge to a maintenance of effort (MOE) regulation (10 NYCRR 86-1.11 [g] [7]), which is designed to encourage general hospitals to maintain their efforts at providing care to those unable or unwilling to pay for care and to discourage hospitals from shifting the financial burdens associated with bad debt and charity care (BDCC) to other hospitals, it cannot be said that because DOH delayed implementation of MOE reallocation for 10 years, the reallocation of BDCC funds for rate years 1983 through 1987 should be permanently enjoined, since the statutory methodologies and the MOE regulations contain no time limit for the implementation of MOE reallocations: the timing of implementation of that process is within the agency's discretion, and the mere passage of time is insufficient to warrant judicial intervention in the administrative process.  Plaintiffs have shown no prejudice stemming from the delay and may still challenge DOH's interpretation of the methodologies as reflected in the 1984 MOE regulation notwithstanding that documents relating to the adoption of that regulation either are in long-term storage or have been destroyed: the request for those documents was made in 1994; plaintiffs could have mounted a challenge to the 1984 MOE regulation in 1984 but did not do so, and there is no proof that the documentation was unavailable in 1984 or for a reasonable period thereafter.  Also it cannot be said that potential witnesses are unavailable to testify: although several former financial officers have left their positions, there is no proof that those witnesses are unavailable or that the testimony of the one deceased former financial officer is critical to a challenge to the MOE reallocation. Moreover, the assertion by some hospitals that they have destroyed source documents relevant to data submitted to DOH fails to demonstrate that they are unable to contest DOH's calculations. </SPAN></P>

That error, however, can be remedied by recouping the amount of overpayment and revising the reallocation made to other hospitals.  The fact that several hospitals have terminated operations is inherent in the reallocation process, and plaintiffs have not shown that the exclusion of the defunct institutions from the reallocation process will result in a shortfall in the funds to be redistributed to general hospitals who have maintained their BDCC effort.  Further, plaintiffs have not shown that they will be prejudiced by having to provide additional moneys to eliminate the shortfall, or that there is a significant difference between the amount to be recouped from and the amount to be redistributed to defunct hospitals.  Plaintiffs have failed to establish that, to the extent that DOH was required as a practical matter to rely upon some data that was erroneous or unaudited, such data will produce an unreasonable reallocation or that the entire process is so fundamentally flawed as to be arbitrary and capricious. </SPAN></P>

Also without merit is the contention that plaintiffs have been denied procedural due process: DOH notified each hospital in January 1994 of the data to be utilized in the MOE reallocation computations and requested each hospital to inform it of any errors in that data; some hospitals did report errors and corrections were made.  Administrative review is not necessary when the methodology itself or the promulgation of a regulation has been challenged, and the availability of CPLR article 78 review to challenge the actual reallocation satisfies due process requirements.  </SPAN></P>

In a challenge to a maintenance of effort (MOE) regulation (10 NYCRR 86-1.11 [g] [7]), which is designed to encourage general hospitals to maintain their efforts at providing care to those unable or unwilling to pay for care and to discourage hospitals from shifting the financial burdens associated with bad debt and charity care (BDCC) to other hospitals by authorizing the State Department of Health (DOH) to reallocate regional pool funds if it finds that there has been a change in the proportional amount of BDCC need provided by the hospitals, DOH improperly reallocated, pursuant to a revised statutory methodology, State-wide BDCC pool funds for the rate years 1986 and 1987 in the same manner that it reallocated regional BDCC pool funds.  Where the statute is unambiguous (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2807-a [8] [e]; [16] [a]; [24] [a]), it is inappropriate to defer to the agency's interpretation; moreover, the interpretation of the agency is contrary to its own regulations, which do not authorize such a reallocation. Even if it is assumed that reallocation of State-wide BDCC pool funds is consistent with the policy underlying the MOE statute and that the failure of the Legislature to authorize the reallocation of State-wide BDCC pool funds was an oversight, if any unsought consequences result, the Legislature is best suited to evaluate and resolve them.  Thus, because the MOE statute and regulations do not authorize reallocation of State-wide BDCC pool funds, the determination of DOH to reallocate those funds exceeded the agency's powers, and was arbitrary and capricious. However, neither the improper reallocation of State-wide BDCC pool funds nor the improper distribution to a hospital of more than 100% of its BDCC need warrants the issuance of an injunction permanently restraining implementation of the MOE reallocation scheme, since those improprieties may be corrected by a remittal to the agency for a proper recalculation.  </SPAN></P>

Although the present regulations provide that a qualified medical social worker would have to be replaced by a person holding a Master's degree in social work, there is a lack of any specific harm to any of the plaintiff organizations other than generalized statements that continuing with the present rule would somehow diminish the care presently available or have a deleterious effect on patients.  From a reading of plaintiffs' brief, it is clear that the main contention of plaintiffs is that the executive order vests the Governor's Office of Regulatory Reform with a &quot;virtually limitless&quot; veto power in the rule-making process, a concern which is more appropriately addressed by the Legislature.  Since no final determination was made in the challenged proceeding and any anticipated harm to the plaintiffs is remote and highly speculative, plaintiffs have failed to sustain their burden of establishing standing in this matter.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's attorney was found not to have satisfied the condition placed upon the practice of law under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 470, by non-New York residents, that they maintain an office for the transaction of law business within the state. The trial court then granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint based on this non-compliance. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court decision. The court found that the evidence amply supported the trial court's factual determination. The court found the assertion by plaintiff that his attorney transacted legal business from a small room located in the basement of a restaurant and bar reachable only by passing through a kitchen and down a flight of stairs was most improbable. In addition, the court found that plaintiff's attorney had not reported any New York income for the past five years, had no employees in the state, his name was not posted anywhere on the premises, there was no indication that any of the employees of the restaurant/bar had ever been instructed to accept legal papers, and the attorney had listed a Washington address as his office. The court also held that the &sect; 470 office requirement was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gravamen of the landowner's complaint and petition was a denial in 1992 by the town of his application to rezone his property to permit him to build a senior citizen mobile home park. The landowner never initiated any challenge to this denial until after the town discovered in 1995 that certain 1986 and 1987 amendments to its zoning laws were never filed with the secretary of state as required by law. To remedy this defect, the state legislature enacted special laws validating the amendments conditioned on the town's compliance with the State Environmental Quality Review Act. The court affirmed and found that to the extent that the landowner challenged the propriety of the town's denial of his rezoning application, the proceeding was clearly time-barred as it was not commenced within four months of the determination. The landowner's claim that the denial of his application constituted a violation of his civil rights was also untimely because it was not asserted within three years of its accrual. The court rejected the landowner's challenges to the town's seeking curative legislation as to the amendments that were never filed with the secretary of state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon leaving the scene of a burglary, defendant disregarded flashing lights of a responding patrol car and led the police on a high-speed car chase during which an officer was killed. Defendant was subsequently convicted, upon a guilty plea, of murder in the second degree, burglary in the third degree, attempted burglary in the third degree, and reckless endangerment in the first degree. The predicate offense for defendant's felony murder conviction was burglary in the third degree. Prior to pleading guilty, defendant sought dismissal of the felony murder count on the ground that the felony murder statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it did not state the specific degrees of burglary that might form the predicate felony. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that, by enumerating the degrees of some crimes and not others, the legislature made clear that all degrees of burglary could serve as predicate offenses. Moreover, the manner in which defendant attempted to evade the police in his immediate flight from this burglary made it the very type of dangerous felony that the legislature intended to serve as a predicate felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found, in the gas supplier's action to have certain portions of the town codes declared unconstitutional, that the towns failed to submit evidentiary proof demonstrating that compliance with the respective town codes did not present an &quot;obstacle&quot; to compliance with the federal statute. They further failed to establish that the fees charged by them for compliance with the local regulations were fair. Thus, the towns failed to make the required prima facie showing of their entitlement to summary judgment. Therefore, the supreme court should have denied their respective cross motions for summary judgment. Accordingly, the court modified the judgment by denying the towns' motions, and affirmed the denial of the gas supplier's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nursing home sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent appellee state from collection of assessments under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-d (1990). The Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York) dismissed the complaint and partially granted the state's summary judgment enforcement motion. The nursing home appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home occupied a unique position as an eleemosynary institution because it was neither a Medicaid participant nor one of a limited number of other specially created institutions. It objected to statutory assessments under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-d (1990) on constitutional equal protection grounds because it would not benefit from them inasmuch as they were intended to shore up the Medicaid structure. The trial court dismissed the nursing home's complaint and entered an order that required statutory reporting. On appeal the court modified the trial court order and, as modified, affirmed it. The court held that the 0.6 percent assessment of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-d (2)(b)(I) (1990), in contrast to the 1.2 percent assessment of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-d(2)(b)(ii) (1992), was a valid assessment that bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state interest of raising revenues to reduce the budget and Medicaid deficit because the 0.6 percent assessment applied to all nursing facilities, except those exempted, and it was not reimbursable. The 1.2 percent assessment was arbitrary, inconsistent with the statutory purpose, and unequal as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the 0.6 assessment, but found that the 1.2 assessment could not be applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Health-Related Facilities - Constitutionality of Statute Imposing Assessment on Gross Receipts of Certain Health-Related Facilities - Equal Protection of Laws Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d (2) (b) (ii), which, in 1992, imposed an additional assessment on residential health care facilities (RHCFs) of 1.2% of gross receipts over and above the initial 1990 assessment of 0.6% in order to deal with budget gaps caused by Medicaid expenses, excepting RHCFs that are financed entirely by charitable contributions or income derived from them and facilities dedicated solely to the care of police, firefighters, volunteer firefighters and emergency service personnel, is unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff, a non-Medicaid, not-for-profit RHCF that does not fit within any of the statutory exemptions. While the initial nonreimbursable 0.6% across-the-board assessment was a valid, constitutionally imposed assessment that bore a rational relationship to the legitimate State interest of raising revenues to reduce the budget and Medicaid deficit, the 1992 amendment deprived plaintiff of equal protection by declaring the 1.2% assessment to be a reimbursable cost in determining a facility's Medicaid rate, thereby leaving plaintiff as the only not-for-profit nursing home in the State that does not get either an exemption or Medicaid reimbursement for the assessments.  To meet equal protection criteria, there must be general uniformity of treatment of those similarly situated, the classifications for disparity must be reasonable, and the taxes or assessments imposed must be uniform within the class.  The added 1.2% is a palpably arbitrary assessment, inconsonant with the statutory purpose, and grossly unequal when visited exclusively upon plaintiff.  By singling out plaintiff to pay the full, unreimbursable 1.2% assessment, the State denied plaintiff equal protection under the Federal and State Constitutions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car service filed its application for four licenses from the Village, which was denied because the Village had already issued the maximum number of licenses it was allowed pursuant to Monticello, N.Y., Village Code art 1, &sect; 163-2.

The car service commenced this action seeking a declaration that the aforementioned sections of the Village Code were unconstitutional, thereby supporting its application for a permanent injunction. Two other taxi services in the Village sought to intervene, as they owned 19 of the 21 allowed licenses. The court denied the car service's request, dismissed the complaint without addressing the constitutionality of the Village Code, and denied the proposed intervenors' motion as academic. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the car service was not entitled to injunctive relief because it pursued its intended course despite knowledge that licensure and registration were required prior to the operation of the business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Right to Farm Law, codified at N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 308, the farm requested that the commissioner issue an opinion regarding the soundness of the farm's manure management program, which would operate to bar any private nuisance action brought by a private party. The non-profit corporation contended that the statute violated the Due Process Clause because it did not provide for notice and a hearing. On appeal, the court held that the non-profit corporation's claim of deprivation of procedural due process necessarily failed where the non-profit corporation identified its property interest as the right to have a court determine the merits of a private nuisance suit. Such a right did not constitute a due process protected interest because the non-profit corporation did not have a vested interest in any rule of the common law. The court further held that the commissioner's determination was not arbitrary or capricious, as it was made in accordance with his responsibilities and fully supported by facts in the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with first-degree murder, argued that plea bargain provisions, which enabled a defendant charged with first-degree murder to avoid any possibility of a death sentence by entering into an agreement with the prosecution, penalized his right to a jury trial, by exposing him to the risk of death only when he exercised that right. The trial judge held that the plea bargain provisions were unconstitutional. The State moved to reargue the judge's order. Defendant and the State reached a plea bargain agreement. The trial judge denied the State's motion to reargue the order and advised defendant and the State that he would not accept their plea bargain agreement unless the State first withdrew the notice of intent to seek the death penalty. On appeal, the court held the plea bargain statutes were constitutional and that a plea bargain was not invalid merely because it was induced by fear of receiving the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding against Body or Officer - Prohibition - When Remedy Available - Constitutionality of Statute - Conversion to Declaratory Judgment Action The People's petition pursuant to CPLR article 78 seeking to prohibit respondent Justice from enforcing so much of his orders in a capital murder case as declared unconstitutional the plea bargain provisions of New York's death penalty statute, which enable a defendant charged with the capital crime of murder in the first degree to avoid any possibility of a death sentence by entering into a plea bargain agreement with the People (CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]; 220.60 [2] [a]), must be denied.  Because of its extraordinary nature, prohibition is available only where there is a clear legal right, and then only when a court, in cases where judicial authority is challenged, acts or threatens to act without jurisdiction or in excess of its authorized powers.  Furthermore, prohibition is not a proper method to determine the constitutionality of a statute.  However, the People's alternative request that the proceeding be converted into an action for a declaratory judgment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 103) to declare the challenged plea bargain provisions to be constitutional and valid in all respects is granted.  The remedy of a declaratory judgment is available in cases where a constitutional question is involved or the legality or meaning of a statute is in question and no question of fact is involved.  Further, a declaratory judgment may be used to attack a criminal court's interlocutory ruling when the ruling has an obvious effect extending far beyond the matter pending before it so that it is likely that the issue will arise again with the same result in other cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Constitutionality of Plea Bargain Provisions of Death Penalty Statute The plea bargain provisions of New York's death penalty statute, which enable a defendant charged with the capital crime of murder in the first degree to avoid any possibility of a death sentence by entering into a plea bargain agreement with the People (CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]; 220.60 [2] [a]), do not unconstitutionally penalize a capital defendant's right to a jury trial by exposing such defendant to the risk of death only when exercising that right.  Respondent Justice therefore erred in declaring the plea bargain provisions to be unconstitutional in reliance upon the decision of the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">United States v Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (390 US 570). In contrast to the Federal Kidnaping Act found unconstitutional in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the death penalty statute in New York provides for a bifurcated trial where the defendant's guilt, and the sentence to be imposed, are determined separately by the jury.  At the guilt phase, the defendant retains all of his or her constitutional protections, e.g., he or she is not compelled to take the witness stand, and the People must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. At the sentencing phase, the defendant has the opportunity to present &quot;any evidence&quot;, including his or her own testimony, &quot;relevant to any mitigating factor&quot; set forth in the statute (CPL 400.27 [6], [9]).  Moreover, the plea bargain provisions herein prohibit a capital defendant from pleading guilty, as of right, to murder in the first degree; rather, they merely grant the People the discretion to enter into a plea bargain agreement with the capital defendant so as to remove the case from the capital punishment track.  Furthermore, the Supreme Court in decisions subsequent to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has reaffirmed the permissibility of plea bargaining in order to avoid a possible death penalty. Lastly, any inquiry into whether the State Constitution provides enhanced protection in this case is better left to the Court of Appeals, which, in any event, has given its unequivocal approval to the practice of plea bargaining. </SPAN></P>

Here, the husband had refused to deliver respondent wife a Jewish religious divorce. In response to the husband's motion the wife waived all of her rights under &sect; 236(B)(5)(h), (6)(d). The wife requested that the trial court dismiss the husband's motion as moot. The trial court found that the motion was not moot, but it denied the motion to declare the statutes unconstitutional. The court reversed. It ruled that the trial court should have found the underlying controversy had been rendered moot and that the judicial determination sought would constitute the rendering of an advisory opinion. Because the wife waived her rights to have the husband's failure to deliver a Jewish divorce considered on the issues of equitable distribution and maintenance, there was no dispute between the parties which had to be resolved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which granted respondent company's motion for summary judgment, declared N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp;. Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 603 to be unconstitutional, declared appellant's tax notice determination void, and permanently enjoined appellant from enforcing the notice against respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a lower court judgment that granted respondent company's motion for summary judgment, declared N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 603 to be unconstitutional, voided the tax notice determination, and permanently enjoined appellant from enforcing the tax notice against respondent. Section 603 disallowed a depreciation deduction for a corporation's property placed in service out of the city, while allowing such a deduction for property located within the city. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court because it found that the taxing ordinance was not even-handed. The court determined that the ordinance was facially discriminatory and that appellant failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that there was no other method to advance a legitimate local interest unrelated to economic protectionism. The court concluded that the ordinance had the practical effect of discriminating against taxpayers doing business in the city that had commercial property outside the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court judgment that granted respondent company's motion for summary judgment and declared appellant city's taxing ordinance to be unconstitutional because the ordinance was facially discriminatory and appellant failed to demonstrate that there was no other method to advance a legitimate local interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - New York City Business Tax Favoring In-State Property Holders The corporate taxing provision of the Administrative Code of the City of New York tax that disallows an accelerated depreciation deduction otherwise allowed under Internal Revenue Code (26 USC) &sect; 168 for a corporation's property &quot;placed in service&quot; outside of New York, while allowing such a deduction for property located within New York (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 11-602 [8]), confers preferential tax treatment upon local businesses, concomitantly discriminating against out-of-State property holders, so as to violate the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]).  Where, as here, a tax statute that burdens out-of-State businesses more than it burdens local businesses is facially discriminatory and not an &quot;even-handed&quot; regulation, the taxing authority has the burden of demonstrating that there is no other method to advance a legitimate local interest. In this case, the City has failed to articulate what constitutionally legitimate local interest is being served.  No matter how the differential depreciation is explained, it impermissibly imposes on a business's interstate commercial decisions.  The unequal treatment of corporate taxpayers results solely from the situs of their activities and provides a commercial advantage to local businesses.  The practical effect of the tax scheme is to discriminate against taxpayers doing business in New York City who have commercial property located outside of New York such as plaintiff, a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business in North Carolina engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in interstate commerce. The City's argument that there is a distinction, for Commerce Clause purposes, between overt differences in tax rates, and a mere disallowance of a mode of deduction for out-of-State property, elevates form over substance and lacks merit.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Retroactive Pension Benefits - Disproportionate Financial Burden Placed upon First Employers Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 803 (L 1993, ch 437), which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> permits current members of a public retirement system, who did not join when they first became eligible because they were unaware of their right to do so, to obtain retroactive membership to the date when they first became eligible, does not unconstitutionally place a disproportionate financial burden upon first employers.  Plaintiffs' due process and equal protection claims have been rendered moot by subsequent amendments (L 1995, ch 683; L 1997, ch 606), which spread out or &quot;socialize&quot; the costs of retroactive membership among all of the participating employers in the affected retirement systems.  </SPAN></P>

Section 803 does not entail the payment of extra compensation to employees.  It merely extends retroactive membership and presents the possibility of increased pension benefits to current public employees who have been in continuous public service and always eligible to join the retirement system but for the fact they were not informed of that right.  </SPAN></P>

Although section 803 permits the public employer to amortize retroactive membership costs over a period of 5 or 10 years, the indebtedness is not voluntarily assumed; rather, it is imposed on first employers, like a judgment, for past breach of duty. In any event, NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8 specifically excludes from the article VIII prohibitions any increases in pension benefits resulting from the extension of retroactive membership rights under section 803.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant's extraterritorial arrest in New York, by New Jersey detectives armed with arrest warrants issued by both State and Federal courts in New Jersey charging him with conspiracy to commit murder and aggravated assault, was lawful where two of the officers knocked on the door of defendant's apartment, identified themselves as &quot;police&quot; and an officer stationed on the fire escape then apprehended defendant as he attempted to flee by climbing out of the window. Although the New Jersey officers had no official authority to arrest defendant or to execute the warrants in New York (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 140.10 [3]; 120.70 [1]; Fed Rules Crim Pro, rule 4 [d] [1]) and were not otherwise in close pursuit of defendant (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 140.55), the officers nonetheless made a valid citizen's arrest (CPL 570.34) since the officers were not acting under the &quot;color of authority&quot; to obtain evidence not available to private citizens.  Other than identifying themselves as &quot;police&quot;, the New Jersey officers did nothing that could not have been done by any private person.  While the officers did act in their law enforcement capacity in obtaining the warrants, and in obtaining the cooperation of the New York City police earlier on the day of the arrest, they gained no evidence solely by virtue of their official status.  They simply made a warrantless arrest of a fleeing felon on a fire escape and then escorted him back through the window into his apartment where the subject plastic bags of cocaine, in plain view on the refrigerator, were lawfully seized. Under these circumstances, defendant's arrest was not the &quot;functional equivalent&quot; of an unlawful warrantless arrest inside his home since defendant's flight was not precipitated by any official coercion.  Defendant's return back into the apartment was necessitated by the fact that he was shirtless and the need to assist his crying two-year-old daughter, whom he had abandoned, unattended in the apartment in his haste to escape.  Moreover, even if the officers' authority to act as private persons was negated by their act of identifying themselves as &quot;police&quot;, their technical violation of procedural statutes conferring the power to arrest did not implicate any constitutionally protected right such as would require suppression. Given the existence of the State and Federal warrants authorizing defendant's arrest, there is no viable claim that defendant's arrest lacked probable cause.  Therefore, the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the exclusionary rule remedy, are not applicable.  Accordingly, defendant's conviction of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree should be affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In petitioner wife and respondent husband's divorce proceedings, the wife filed an application to determine the husband's child support obligations. The parties cross appealed from the order of the Family Court, Schenectady County (New York), which modified the hearing examiner's ordered but still granted the wife's application in a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act art. 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband had inherited a substantial sum, of which the trial court ordered $ 100,000.

The valuation figure was erroneous due to the trial court's failure to consider tax consequences of the lump sum award and evidence of growth in the assets since receipt. The trial court should have considered the cost of the children's insurance in determining the basic support obligation, and the order to provide insurance for the wife was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Support - Consideration of Inheritance in Making Additional Child Support Award </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a proceeding to determine respondent's support obligations for his two minor children, Family Court was authorized to award the children a share of respondent's inheritance from his father as additional child support pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (e), which provides that the court may allocate a proportion of a gift or inheritance received by a parent to child support to be &quot;paid in a manner determined by the court&quot;.  Respondent's argument that the moneys generated by his inheritance should be imputed to him as income for purposes of calculating his basic child support obligation under Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (c) is not only contrary to the plain language of Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (e), which treats inheritances as &quot;non-recurring payments from extraordinary sources not otherwise considered as income&quot;, but is also inconsistent with its underlying purpose and objective which is to ensure an appropriate and consistent level of support for children.  Nor is there any merit to respondent's assertion that an award of additional child support pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (e) duplicates his basic child support obligation under Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (c) since Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (f) expressly contemplates and permits an award of additional support beyond the noncustodial parent's basic child support obligation. Lastly, respondent has failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (e) is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Support - Consideration of Inheritance in Making Additional Child Support Award - Propriety of Lump-Sum Distribution - Consideration of Health Insurance Premiums in Determining Basic Child Support Obligation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a proceeding to determine respondent's support obligations for his two minor children, Family Court's $ 100,000 lump-sum award as additional child support pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (e) based upon respondent's inheritance from his father was inappropriate under the circumstances, especially since the lump-sum distribution would require respondent to liquidate substantial assets.  Although Family Court properly charged respondent with the increase in the value of respondent's inheritance between the date of his father's death and the date of distribution, the court's finding that respondent's actual proceeds from the estate amounted to at least $ 400,000 lacks support in the record as a whole.  Moreover, the parties' son is presently residing with respondent and, to the extent that this child already enjoys an enhanced standard of living as a result of respondent's inheritance, it would be inappropriate to award him additional monetary support.  In addition, Family Court erred in failing to consider the tax consequences of a lump-sum award.  Furthermore, Family Court also erred in ordering respondent to maintain health insurance for petitioner and in failing to consider whether the additional expense incurred by respondent in providing health and dental insurance for the children warranted deviation from his $ 115 weekly basic child support obligation imposed by the statute.  Health insurance premiums are not proper add-ons to the basic child support obligation. Family Court should have taken this additional expense into consideration in determining whether respondent's basic child support obligation was fair and just and, having failed to do so, the court's award of child support was fundamentally flawed. Accordingly, the matter must be remitted to Family Court for a new hearing as to child support. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Support - Consideration of Inheritance in Making Additional Child Support Award </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a proceeding to determine respondent's support obligations for his two minor children where Family Court's initial support order, including a $ 100,000 lump-sum award as additional child support pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (e) based upon respondent's inheritance from his father was set aside as fundamentally flawed, Family Court, in determining whether an award of additional child support is warranted on remittal, must take into consideration a number of relevant factors including, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the parties' combined parental income, their pro rata basic support obligation, whether such an award would reduce respondent's income below the poverty level or self-support reserve, the actual needs of the children and, ultimately, whether such an award would be unfair or unjust in light of the basic support obligation already imposed (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 413 [1] [c], [d], [f]).  The mere fact that respondent inherited a sizeable sum of money does not, standing alone, provide an adequate basis for an award of additional child support. Should Family Court determine that an additional award of support pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 413 (1) (e) is warranted here and, further, that a lump-sum payment is appropriate under the circumstances, the court should give careful thought to the impact that such an award would have upon respondent and consider whether, in light of whatever assets may be held by respondent, the award can be fashioned in such a manner as to avoid invading the principal.  Any outright grant of funds to petitioner, such as the $ 25,000 previously awarded by Family Court as additional child support, would be looked upon with disfavor by the Appellate Division.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Taxpayer's Action Challenging Constitutionality of Environmental Bond Act Petitioners lack standing as citizen-taxpayers under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b (1) to challenge the constitutionality of the &quot;Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act of 1996&quot; (L 1996, ch 412), which authorized the State to incur indebtedness not exceeding $ 1.75 billion for the purpose of preserving the environment by means of safe drinking water projects, clean water projects, solid waste projects, environmental restoration projects and air quality projects (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 1996, ch 413).  Since State Finance Law &sect; 123-b (1) specifically excepts from its application &quot;the authorization, sale, execution or delivery of a bond issue or notes issued in anticipation thereof by the state or any agency, instrumentality or subdivision thereof or by any public corporation or public benefit corporation&quot;, a taxpayer has neither common-law nor statutory standing to challenge the issuance of State bonds or bond anticipation notes. Petitioners' challenge to the constitutionality of State Finance Law &sect; 123-b (1), raised for the first time in their reply brief, has not been properly raised on appeal and lacks merit in any event.  In addition, petitioners lack constitutional voter standing with regard to so much of the proceeding as is predicated on NY Constitution, article III, &sect; 16, as that provision is not &quot;linked to any voting rights&quot;.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Voter Standing to Challenge Environmental Bond Act as Violative of &quot;Single Work or Purpose&quot; Constitutional Debt-Incurring Provision Petitioners have separate and independent voter standing to challenge the &quot;Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act of 1996&quot; (L 1996, ch 412), which authorized the State to incur indebtedness not exceeding $ 1.75 billion for the purpose of preserving the environment by means of safe drinking water projects, clean water projects, solid waste projects, environmental restoration projects and air quality projects (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 1996, ch 413), as violative of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 11, which provides, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that &quot;no debt shall be hereafter contracted by or in behalf of the state, unless such debt shall be authorized by law, for some single work or purpose, to be distinctly specified therein&quot;.  An important purpose underlying this constitutional provision was to permit the people of the State to intelligently evaluate and appraise the single purpose of any proposed long-term bonded indebtedness to be incurred by the State and to prohibit the Legislature from lumping several purposes into one bond authorization and thereby obtain voter approval that perhaps could not otherwise be obtained if the relative merit and strength of each purpose were separately evaluated and appraised.  Voter standing to sue in an action or proceeding predicated, as here, upon an alleged violation of any of the fundamental requirements of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 11 is therefore necessary to ensure that the State government does not ignore constitutional dictates concerning public financing laws, especially since a citizen-taxpayer lacks standing under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b (1) to challenge the issuance of State bonds or bond anticipation notes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Challenge to Environmental Bond Act as Violative of &quot;Single Work or Purpose&quot; Constitutional Debt-Incurring Provision The &quot;Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act of 1996&quot; (L 1996, ch 412), which authorized the State to incur indebtedness not exceeding $ 1.75 billion for the purpose of &quot;preserving, enhancing, restoring, and improving&quot; the quality of the State's &quot;environment&quot; by means of safe drinking water projects, clean water projects, solid waste projects, environmental restoration projects and air quality projects (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 1996, ch 413), is not violative of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 11, which provides, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that &quot;no debt shall be hereafter contracted by or in behalf of the state, unless such debt shall be authorized by law, for some single work or purpose, to be distinctly specified therein&quot;.  The broad environmental projects authorized by the bond act are necessarily and naturally related to one another such that they constitute a single purpose within the meaning of the constitutional provision. As such, the voters were permitted to &quot;intelligently evaluate and appraise&quot; the wisdom of incurring the subject indebtedness for the single over-all purpose of benefitting the State's environment and, thus, the purpose underlying the &quot;single work or purpose&quot; provision of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 11 was fulfilled.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for two counts of conspiracy in the second degree.

Upon his arrival, defendant's case was scheduled and thereafter tried. Upon his conviction, defendant was sentenced to two concurrent prison terms. Defendant appealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner railroad system owner and operator sought review of the decision of respondent Tax Appeal Tribunal (tribunal), which sustained a deficiency of a petroleum business tax imposed under N.Y. Tax Law art. 13-A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner purchased petroleum fuel from out-of-state suppliers, brought the fuel into New York, and stored it until it was used in locomotives that traveled both in and outside of New York. Pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 301-a(c)(1), the owner filed monthly returns and reduced its taxable diesel fuel gallons for &quot;allocation of fuel used outside of the state,&quot; which reflected his view that only imported fuel actually consumed by locomotives in New York was taxable. State tax authorities conducted an audit of the owner's business and issued a notice of deficiency, which was sustained by an administrative law judge (ALJ). The court affirmed the tribunal's affirmance of the ALJ's determination because &sect; 301-a(c)(1) did not violate the commerce clause. &quot;Use&quot; was broadly defined and included the situation when an owner withdrew the imported fuel from storage in New York and dispensed it by fueling it into locomotives. The tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce, as the &quot;taxable event&quot; was the withdrawal from storage of the fuel. Double taxation did not result because the fuel was not taxed if it was merely transported through the state or consumed within the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Petroleum Gross Receipts Tax - Failure to Raise Constitutional Claim before Administrative Law Judge - Conversion of Constitutional Challenge into Declaratory Judgment Action A CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul a determination of the Tax Appeals Tribunal sustaining a deficiency of a petroleum business tax on the ground that the taxing statute (Tax Law &sect; 301-a) facially discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution should not be dismissed merely because petitioner, an interstate railway operator, first raised the constitutional claim before the Tribunal.  It is irrelevant that petitioner did not raise the constitutional claim before the Administrative Law Judge since the Tribunal correctly declined to rule on the constitutional issue based on the fact that it had no jurisdiction to consider whether a statute is unconstitutional on its face.  In addition, since an article 78 proceeding is not the proper vehicle to attack the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 301-a, that portion of the instant proceeding seeking such relief will be converted into a declaratory judgment action </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 103 [c]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Petroleum Gross Receipts Tax - Commerce Clause - Constitutionality of Imposing Tax on Withdrawal of Fuel from Storage for Use in Interstate Railway Operations Tax Law &sect; 301-a, which imposes a monthly petroleum business tax on petitioner, an interstate railway operator, for imported diesel motor fuel withdrawn from storage tanks in New York and used to power locomotives in petitioner's interstate operations, does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution since the &quot;taxable event&quot; triggering the tax is the &quot;withdrawal from storage&quot; of the fuel and not consumption. The fuel, upon being unloaded and stored in New York, ceases to be a subject of transportation in interstate commerce and loses its immunity as such from State taxation. The fact that the fuel is later withdrawn from storage for use in interstate transportation does not affect the power of the State to tax it all before the interstate transportation commences.  The distinction between storage and consumption minimizes the potential for double taxation since the fuel could not be taxed in States through which it is merely transported nor by the State in which it is merely consumed. A fair result is achieved by such a tax because a State in which preloading storage facilities are maintained is likely to provide substantial services to those facilities, including police protection and the maintenance of public access roads.  Accordingly, the determination of the Tax Appeals Tribunal sustaining a deficiency of a petroleum business tax imposed upon petitioner should be confirmed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superintendent's directive that a specific section of the Plan should be amended to provide that an insurer could not offset against an unearned premium balance on a cancelled policy when the insurance premium was advanced under a finance agreement was rationally based on N.Y.

Law &sect; 3428(d) mandated return of unearned premiums to the bank or premium finance company upon cancellation of a financed insurance contract. Although the statutes were in existence when the subject Plan section was adopted, it was not until about four years later that the rule's susceptibility to an interpretation inconsistent with the clear mandates of the statutes was brought to the Superintendent's attention, making it incumbent upon him to clarify the rule to ensure compliance therewith. The Plan's claim that the directive unconstitutionally impaired obligations under existing contracts between its participating insureds and insurers was improperly raised for the first time on appeal and was without merit.

The Commerce Clause is not implicated since, unlike the business of transporting individuals between States, the practice of commuting from one State to work in another does not produce the requisite effect on commerce. In addition, maintaining a residence and spending time in New York, purchasing utilities, acquiring items of service, utilizing banking facilities and frequenting restaurants and retail establishments, does not necessarily involve interstate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Department of Environmental Conservation (department), sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County, New York, which denied the department's motion to dismiss respondent property owners' complaint on the ground that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department denied the property owners' request for a permit and variances under the Tidal Wetlands Act, N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law art. 25, to construct a residence on property located near a bay. Thus, the property owners commenced a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 asserting that the denial of their application by the department constituted a taking of their property without compensation. The original petition seeking a determination that a taking had occurred expressly conceded the validity of the department's denial of the permit and related variances. The original claim therefore did not give notice of the later, amended claim and thus waived that claim. Accordingly, the court found on appeal that the supreme court improperly held that the relation back doctrine was applicable. In denying the department's motion to dismiss the complaint, the court found that the supreme court should have considered the merits of the arguments the department raised in the original motion to dismiss. In addressing those arguments, the court found that dismissal of the property owners' claims that a taking occurred was not warranted, as those claims stated valid causes of action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to an aggregate term of incarceration of 11 to 22 years. Defendant contended that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered and that the sentence was unduly harsh or severe and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments of the trial court. The court found that defendant had failed to preserve for the court's review his contention that his plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. The court held that, in any event, the record established that defendant had ample time to confer with counsel before accepting the offer and stated during his plea colloquy that he was voluntarily pleading guilty and had not been threatened or forced to do so. The court also found that the record showed that the trial court made appropriate inquiry to assure defendant's intelligent waiver of the defense of agency. The court held that the sentence imposed on defendant was not so unduly harsh or severe or that it constituted cruel or unusual punishment, as the sentencing statute had not been unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant birth parents sought review of the decision of the Family Court, Niagara County, New York, which concluded that the best interest of the child born to the birth mother were served by his adoption. The birth parents did not challenge the best interests finding, but instead challenged the court's jurisdiction and raised constitutional challenges. The court had determined on prior appeal that the birth mother's consent was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Birth parents lived in Pennsylvania. The child was placed with respondent adoptive parents in New York shortly after birth, pursuant to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children. In addition to contesting the adoption, the birth parents had brought a custody proceeding in a Pennsylvania state court and also an action in federal district court seeking custody. The court held that the family court had jurisdiction under the Interstate Compact because the birth mother, as the sending agency, had transferred jurisdiction by executing valid consent documents. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 374-a(1), art. V(a). The court had already determined that the birth father was entitled only to notice and an opportunity to participate at a best interests hearing. The court held that the New York adoption law did not violate the birth father's due process and equal protection rights. There was a rational basis for treating him differently from the birth mother because he had never accepted responsibility for the child. The court held that adoption based upon a best interests of the child standard did not violate the birth parents' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the family court in favor of the adoptive parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Family Court - Subject Matter Jurisdiction over Private Placement Adoption Governed by Interstate Compact on Placement of Children Niagara County Family Court at all times possessed subject matter jurisdiction under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (Social Services Law &sect; 374-a) over private placement adoption proceedings involving a child who had been placed in the custody of the New York adoptive parents by the birth mother the day after he was born in Pennsylvania (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115-a), notwithstanding the Pennsylvania Interstate Compact agency's purported rescission of its initial approval of the adoptive child's placement for adoption in New York.  Approval for the child's removal to New York was given by both the Pennsylvania and New York Interstate Compact agencies after they had been supplied with the requisite information, including the identity of the nonresident unwed birth father.  By executing valid consent documents, the birth mother, as the &quot;sending agency&quot; under the Interstate Compact, lawfully transferred both the child and jurisdiction to New York.  Under these circumstances, the child's custody should be decided by the courts of New York.  Pennsylvania, having authorized the removal of the child to New York, may not retroactively rescind its approval for the child's placement in New York.  Furthermore, the State Constitution does not limit Family Court's subject matter jurisdiction only to those adoptions that involve children born in New York.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption - Private Placement Adoption - Interstate Compact on Placement of Children - Constitutional Rights of Unwed &quot;Notice&quot; Father The constitutional rights of the nonresident unwed birth father were not violated by the adoption of his child by the New York adoptive parents after a best interests hearing (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115-a) where the birth mother, as the &quot;sending agency&quot; under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (Social Services Law &sect; 374-a), executed valid consent documents lawfully transferring both the child and jurisdiction from Pennsylvania to New York and both the Pennsylvania and New York Interstate Compact agencies authorized the child's removal to New York after they had been supplied with the requisite information, including the identity of the birth father.  The birth father has failed to meet his burden of proving the adoption statute's&nbsp;unconstitutionality, either facially or as applied, beyond a reasonable doubt.  The birth father's due process rights as a &quot;notice&quot; father (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111-a) were satisfied by affording him an opportunity to participate in the best interests hearing.  The birth father did not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in retaining custody of his child that would allow him to veto the adoption due to his failure to promptly assume parental responsibility prior to and following the birth of his child.  There is no constitutional infirmity in judging the interest of a birth father in being a parent based on his conduct in the six months preceding his child's placement for adoption.  During the period of the birth mother's pregnancy, the birth father was arrested for assaulting her; during that same period he was married to another woman and was living with a 17-year-old girl, whom he impregnated, and he has yet to pay for the birth mother's pregnancy or birth-related expenses.  In addition, the New York adoption statute is not violative of due process merely because it does not require a finding that the birth father is unfit as a parent, nor is the principle of equal protection offended by relying on the birth father's prebirth conduct in determining his rights.  Given the differences between the responsibilities of the birth mother and birth father and the purpose of New York's law, which is to promote early stability and to provide safe and secure homes for children, any difference in the treatment of a birth father and birth mother found in the Domestic Relations Law is rationally related to achieving that purpose and, therefore, any differential treatment does not violate equal protection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption - Private Placement Adoption - Interstate Compact on Placement of Children - Constitutional Rights of Unwed Birth Parents The constitutional rights of the nonresident birth mother were not violated by the adoption of her child by the New York adoptive parents after a best interests hearing (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111-a) where the birth mother, as the &quot;sending agency&quot; under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (Social Services Law &sect; 374-a), voluntarily executed valid consent documents lawfully transferring both the child and jurisdiction from Pennsylvania to New York and both the Pennsylvania and New York Interstate Compact agencies authorized the child's removal to New York after they had been supplied with the requisite information.  The birth mother set the adoption proceedings in motion and has not been unconstitutionally deprived of the custody of her child based on her status as an unwed mother.  The fact that the birth mother lost the presumption of custody by voluntarily placing the child for adoption does not offend constitutional principles nor does utilization of the best interests standard violate her constitutional right to equal protection. Furthermore, the birth mother's arguments that adoptive parents start out in a superior position and that birth parents are presumed to be ambivalent toward a child who has been surrendered for adoption are meritless, inasmuch as the adoption statute specifically provides that there shall be no presumption that any particular disposition is in a child's best interests (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115-b [6] [d] [v]).  Nor is there any merit to her contention that the statute encourages the taking of a child from its parent merely because of the parents' poverty.  The respective financial abilities of the parties, as well as the stability of the current custody arrangement, were proper concerns of the Family Court in reaching a best interests determination.  Furthermore, Family Court did not limit the birth mother's opportunity to present witnesses or to fully develop the record.  Family Court's best interests determination and its order granting the petition of the adoptive parents is fully supported by the record which demonstrated the unstable and irresponsible lifestyle of the birth parents as compared with adoptive parents' &quot;stable, happy and successful marriage&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Special Use Permit - Unconstitutionality of Ordinance Excluding Educational Uses in Historic District Plaintiff educational institution, which, prior to defendant City's adoption of an ordinance amending its zoning provisions to exclude educational uses from the class of special permit uses in a Single-Family Historic District (District), had been allowed to use its properties for educational purposes as a special use within the District, has met its burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the zoning ordinance is unconstitutional on its face due to the failure to provide any mechanism through which the legitimate interests of the parties may be balanced against one another, especially in view of the &quot;preferred status&quot; enjoyed by educational institutions with respect to the application of municipal zoning ordinances. While defendants may exclude plaintiff's educational use of its property from the District upon a proper showing that plaintiff's use is detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare or morals, defendants cannot short circuit the deliberative process by adopting an ordinance that results in the wholesale exclusion of educational uses within the District in the first instance.  By excluding educational uses from the class of special permit uses in the District, defendants effectively have deprived plaintiff of any opportunity to demonstrate that its proposed educational use is consistent with and in furtherance of the public good.  Furthermore, the availability of avenues of review for plaintiff such as a variance application, even if viable, do not cure the facial invalidity in the ordinance. Moreover, neither the variance process, which requires plaintiff to demonstrate practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, nor the zoning amendment process is a constitutionally permissible substitute for the necessary balancing of the parties' competing interests, which most appropriately is undertaken in the context of reviewing an application for a special use permit. Defendants' remaining contentions, including their assertions that the controversy is not ripe for judicial review, lack merit.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment convicting criminal defendant, upon his guilty plea, of the crime of grand larceny in the fourth degree. Although defendant's contentions addressed to the voluntariness of his plea were not preserved for consideration, the transcript of the plea allocution established that defendant's plea of guilty was knowingly and voluntarily entered. Contrary to defendant's assertion, there was no requirement that a defendant personally recite the facts underlying his or her crime. The court was not persuaded that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 410.91, which created the sentencing option of parole supervision for eligible individuals with a history of controlled substance dependence, denied defendant equal protection of the law. The court reasoned that, in light of the current nationwide drug crisis and the resulting criminal conduct, it could not be seriously argued that legislation targeting drug-dependent individuals and providing for intensive drug treatment as an alternative to incarceration did not bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate legislative objective. The court thus held that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 410.91 was constitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the warrant issued after the visit was proper because it was based on sworn affidavits of the officer and the informant. The court further held that the warrant described the premises to be searched with sufficient precision. In affirming, the court held that the federal statute,&nbsp;7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2156, did not preempt state law because the statute expressly did not preclude the state of origination from enacting laws prohibiting the keeping, raising, or using of animals for fighting purposes. The court held that N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 351 was not unconstitutionally vague because it specifically prohibited the owning, possessing, or keeping of any animal under circumstances evincing an intent that such animal engage in animal fighting. The court held that such language was sufficiently definite to provide a person of ordinary intelligence with fair notice of any prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners challenged the order and judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which gave the owners possession of eight apartments but ordered the owners to offer renewal leases to the nurse subtenants of seven other apartments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners successfully challenged a law that allowed the hospital lessee to sublease apartments subject to New York City's Rent Stabilization Law (RSL), New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code of the City of New York, tit. 26, ch. 4, without the consent of the owners and to be deemed a residential tenant. The owners then sought to evict the nurse subtenants and to regain possession of the apartments. The lower court gave the owners possession of eight apartments but ordered that renewal terms be offered to the nurse tenants of the other seven units. Both the owners and the hospital lessee appealed. The court noted that the declaration of unconstitutionality of the law favoring the hospital lessee's tenancy effectively removed that provision from consideration as if it had never been passed. The court then observed that, under the plain language of the RSL, the hospital lessee as the prime tenant had a right to a renewal lease but that the subtenants had no such right.</SPAN></P>

The decision of the Court of Appeals limits </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Cale</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s grant of lease renewal rights regarding corporate-leased housing units to instances where the lease in question specifically names the individual intended occupant and no perpetual tenancy is possible.  Consequently, where, as here, the leases did not name the intended occupant and created the possibility of a tenancy in perpetuity, the leases cannot be renewed.  Absent chapter 940's insulation from subletting restrictions and nonprimary residence claims, the controlling law clearly and unambiguously states that the subtenant nurses are not entitled to renewal leases in their own names (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-504 [a] [1]; &sect; 26-511 [c] [12] [d], [g]).  Moreover, the award of these stabilized tenancies to the subtenant nurses would be a windfall since they never appeared in the action, despite being named as parties, and never had any expectation of the RSL's protection.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of 15 years to life on the first-degree drug possession count; three years to life on the second-degree drug possession count, one to three years on the remaining drug possession counts and the weapon counts; and one year on the drug paraphernalia count. On review, the court affirmed the convictions and the sentences. The court held that the evidence was legally sufficient under the drug factory presumption, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.25(2), to prove defendant constructively possessed all the contraband, and the jury's verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. The jury reached the only reasonable conclusion based on the evidence, i.e., that defendant constructively possessed the contraband found inside and just outside the apartment as one of the participants in the activities in the narcotics factory in the apartment.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the non-Federally funded research being conducted at OMH facilities fails to comply with Federal reporting requirements (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;28 CFR 46.103 [b] [5]) and is therefore subject to Public Health Law article 24-A.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mental Health - Human Subject Research - Validity of Regulations Promulgated by Office of Mental Health - Common-Law Privacy and Due Process Rights of Potential Subjects Regulations promulgated by defendant New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) (14 NYCRR 527.10), which set out procedures to be followed for the participation of adults and children, who are patients or residents of OMH operated and licensed facilities deemed incapable of giving consent, in &quot;more than minimal risk&quot; nontherapeutic research experiments involving psychiatric medications that may cause harmful permanent or fatal side-effects, do not adequately safeguard and therefore violate the common-law privacy and due process rights of potential subjects.  In order to be sustained as constitutional and otherwise viable, the challenged regulations must, at the very least, contain appropriate and specific provisions for notice to the potential subject that his or her capacity is being evaluated and for appropriate administrative and judicial review of a determination regarding capacity.  However, the regulations do not identify or set out specific or even minimum qualifications for the individual or individuals who initially assess a potential subject's capacity, and do not contain a specific protocol for how the assessment is to be carried out.  Further, there are no provisions requiring any notice to the patient that his or her capacity to provide or withhold consent for a particular study is being questioned.  Consequently, there is no provision for review of a determination of lack of capacity at the patient's request so as to satisfy due process requirements.  Moreover, once a patient is deemed incapable (14 NYCRR 527.10 [d] [6]), his or her ability to have an objection to participation or continued participation honored is severely, and in some instances impermissibly curtailed by provisions allowing for override of the objection without notice to the patient or patient's representative based upon the finding of a psychiatrist that the intervention or procedure involved holds out a prospect of some undefined &quot;direct benefit&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;14 NYCRR 527.10 [e] [2] [viii]) and for surrogate consent by individuals other than legal guardians and/or individuals designated pursuant to a durable power of attorney (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;14 NYCRR 527.10 [e] [2] [iv]).  The substantive and procedural safeguards applicable to surrogate decision-making in life-sustaining treatment settings are also applicable to nontherapeutic greater than minimal risk experimentation.  In addition, the provisions of the regulations that allow for consent to be obtained on behalf of minors for participation in such experimentation from the minor's parent or legal guardian, or, where no parent or guardian is available, from an adult family member involved in making treatment decisions for the child (14 NYCRR 527.10 [e] [3] [i]) are also unacceptable.  To the extent that the regulations appear to authorize a determination that a particular child or population of children is abused or neglected, or that, in a given situation, the requirement of parental consent may be harmful to the minor, they conflict with the long-established procedures for the protection of children established in the Social Services Law and the Family Court Act.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancellor issued administrative orders suspending several school board members in two school districts after an investigation aired on television which charged the school boards with improprieties. In two separate suits, school board members sought to vacate the orders, and the chancellor filed cross-motions to dismiss on the ground that the school board members had not exhausted their administrative remedies. In both suits the trial courts vacated the order of suspension and denied the chancellor's cross-motion. On appeal, the court held that the trial courts erred in concluding that the school board members were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to initiating court proceedings. The court pointed out that administrative remedies existed pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2590-1(2) and related regulations. There were exceptions that could be made to the rule, in the trial court's discretion; however, the court held that questions regarding the operation of the public school system were matters for the professional judgment of educators and government officials.</SPAN></P>

Judicial intervention in the administration of the public school system should be limited to exceptional circumstances involving &quot;gross violations of defined public policy&quot;.  The remedies sought by petitioners exist within the administrative review process, and that process has routinely entertained claims by Community School Boards that a Chancellor has wrongfully removed or suspended them from office.

On appeal, the court held that the family court had properly denied respondent's motion to dismiss the petition as untimely. Specifically, the court held that the petition, through N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 360.2(4), operated to toll the period of conditional discharge even though that statute only specifically mentions the tolling of a probationary period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A religious village voted to establish its own school district for its special needs children, pursuant to the recently enacted N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 1504(3). Plaintiffs filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The board of education filed a motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, which was granted by the trial court upon a finding that the statute was constitutional as a matter of law. Plaintiffs sought review and the court reversed and, instead, granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, holding that the statute was unconstitutional as a violation of the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. The court concluded that &sect; 1504(3) had simply resurrected a prior law, which had been deemed unconstitutional, by achieving the same result through indirect means. The court noted that while the law was facially neutral, the specific demographics and criteria made it applicable only to the one village in the entire state, which finding was further buttressed by the purpose of its enactment. The court held that the law was not of uniform state-wide application for all special education needs, but merely to provide a separate facility for the village.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Establishment of Religion -- Validity of Statute Permitting Creation of School District Solely within Municipality to Meet Required Educational Needs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Laws of 1994 (ch 241), which permits a municipality to organize a union free school district consisting of the entire territory of such municipality when the educational interests of the community so require if certain additional requirements are fulfilled, enacted to enable the religious enclave of Satmar Hassidim of the Village of Kiryas Joel to establish a public school to provide special services for their handicapped children outside of the existing public school district, is unconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause since the legislation was crafted to permit only the Village of Kiryas Joel to qualify for its special treatment and it is thus a mere subterfuge that does not constitute a generally applicable law setting forth neutral criteria under which a municipality may have a school district of its own.  The current law was enacted only 11 days after the United States Supreme Court invalidated the prior legislative attempt to create a separate public school district coterminous with the Village and it brings about the same result as the unconstitutional prior law, the creation of a special school district for the Village of Kiryas Joel and no other municipality in the State.  Despite the facial neutrality of the current law's complex series of demographic qualifiers, the demographic criteria selected by the Legislature fulfill no existing educational policy or purpose and limit the range of eligible municipalities to one.  Accordingly, plaintiffs are granted summary judgment declaring the challenged law to be unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 30.00(2). Defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, urging that N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 528 was unconstitutional where the primary placement was to protect society, rather than to serve the interests of the child. The supreme court denied the motion and they appealed. The court affirmed the order, holding that &sect; 528 did not violate the principles of equal protection, for it merely bestowed upon the supreme court the authority to insist that the parents of an incarcerated minor continue to meet their preexisting duty to support their child, just as they would have been bound to had he not been convicted pursuant to N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act.  &sect; 413(1)(a). The court held that &sect; 528 did not require that defendants defray the entire cost of the juvenile's detention. Only those who were able to pay a part of the cost of maintenance of such child could be directed to do so, and then only in such amounts as the supreme court decided was fair and equitable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child - Support - Liability of Parents for Support of Incarcerated Juvenile - Constitutionality of Reimbursement Statute&nbsp;Executive Law &sect; 528, which provides that the persons responsible for the support of a juvenile committed to the custody of the Division for Youth may be required to pay a part of the maintenance costs incurred as a result of the child's placement, in such amounts &quot;as the court may decide to be fair and equitable&quot;, does not violate the principles of equal protection when interpreted to bestow upon the court the authority to insist only that the parents of an incarcerated minor continue to meet their preexisting duty to support their child (Family Ct Act &sect; 413 [1] [a]; &sect; 416), just as they would be bound to had the child not been convicted. Since it would be constitutionally unacceptable to assess a juvenile offender's parents for the additional costs associated with maintaining the security of an institution for the protection of the public, such a charge could not be sustained as &quot;fair and equitable&quot; under the statute.  The existence of the duty of support provides a rational basis for imposing an obligation upon the parents of an incarcerated juvenile that is not shared by the parents or other relatives of an imprisoned adult, or by other members of society.  Accordingly, the Department of Social Services, which, pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 529, paid one half of the cost of the care, maintenance and supervision for defendant's minor son while he was incarcerated in Division facilities, may seek reimbursement from defendant for the expenses it incurred as a result of the juvenile's confinement, limited to only those amounts attributable to items for which defendant would otherwise have been obligated, namely, those things that are properly classified as elements of support, including food, clothing, shelter and the like (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 416).  </SPAN></P>

The petition sought to enjoin respondent city personnel director (director) from using a city residency credit with regard to an eligibles list for appointment to city firefighter and to extend and use another eligibles list in which the non-city residents were candidates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-city residents passed an examination for appointment to the position of city firefighter and were placed on an eligibles list. The director instituted a residency credit in which city residents received additional credits on the written test. The director let the list that the non-city residents were on expire so that he could begin appointing candidates from a second list in which the city residents had the advantage. On appeal, the court reversed the dismissal of the petition. The non-city residents had passed an examination for the position of firefighter and were placed on the eligibles list for appointment. The non-city residents complained that the director was unlawfully appointing favored candidates from another later list instead of giving them priority. Consequently, the non-city residents were directly and substantially affected by the issue being litigated and had standing. Although the non-city residents did not join the candidates from the second list who were city residents, when the proceeding was commenced, the list of eligibles for the second list had not yet been promulgated and the second list candidates were, thus, not necessary parties at that time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a decision by the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which granted plaintiff taxpayers' motion for summary judgment and declared unconstitutional Suffolk County, N.Y., Tax Act art. I, &sect; 3 (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court had declared the Suffolk County Tax Act (Tax Act) unconstitutional. The court held that the Tax Act had not been shown to be unconstitutional. The court first looked to the Tax Act's stated purpose, which was to prevent school district taxpayers from reaping unwarranted windfalls. The legislature had specifically found that due to their high value, nuclear power facilities paid substantial taxes. As such, they created tax havens resulting in lower taxes in the school districts that contained them. Therefore, if it was determined that a nuclear power facility was overassessed and entitled to a refund, the legislature concluded that the other school districts should not be required to pay the refund. The court was of the view that in distinguishing nuclear power facilities from other types of property uses the legislature could rationally have assumed that if such facilities turned out to be overassessed, any tax refund would impose a greater tax windfall for school districts with such facilities if they did not have to pay the entire refund themselves. Thus, the court held that the Tax Act was rationally related to achieving a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by reversing so much as granted the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment declaring the Tax Act 1983 Amendment was unconstitutional. The court granted the state's cross motion for summary judgment. The court declared that the Tax Act 1983 Amendment had not been shown to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Taxpayer Action In an action challenging the constitutionality of a law providing that upon any assessment reductions of nuclear power electrical generating facilities, the school districts in which such facilities were located would be responsible for the school tax refunds, the concerns of the school district's taxpayers over the impact of said law on them are sufficient to gain them standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.  Although the standing issue was never raised by defendants in their cross motions and was not addressed by Supreme Court, defendants did allege as affirmative defenses in their answers that plaintiff taxpayers lacked standing; however, those defenses related solely to plaintiff taxpayers and not the school district. Therefore, the issue of the district's standing is not properly before the court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - School Tax Refunds - Nuclear Power Facilities Suffolk County Tax Act, article I, &sect; 3 as amended by the Laws of 1983 (ch 1018), which provided that upon any assessment reductions of nuclear power electrical generating facilities, the school districts in which such facilities were located, rather than the towns, would be responsible for the school tax refunds, has not been shown to be unconstitutional where plaintiffs have specifically conceded that the Legislature has a legitimate interest in eliminating tax windfalls created by certain highly valued facilities paying substantial amounts of tax, since the classification and the goal are not &quot;wholly disconnected&quot;.  Inasmuch as nuclear power facilities created &quot;tax havens&quot; resulting in lower taxes in the school districts which contained them, the Legislature could rationally conclude that should a nuclear power facility ultimately be determined to be overassessed and entitled to a refund, other school districts should not be required to pay the refund, given that they did not share in the benefit of the initial overassessment. The fact that there was only one school district actually affected by the law is not fatal, since the statute did not, by its terms, single out or limit itself to only one district.  Although plaintiffs attribute an improper intent since only one district was affected by the statute, where there are legitimate purposes to justify the classification whether they are the purposes which actually motivate the Legislature or not, the legislation will still be deemed to have a rational basis. Moreover, merely because the statute applied regardless of the amount determined to be owed as a refund, it cannot be said to violate equal protection principles: the Legislature was warranted in assuming that any refund owed would be substantial, and it was not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use or value.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 221(d)-(f) discriminated between the salaries paid to judges for the county, family, and surrogate courts in one county and the salaries paid to judges who sat in the same courts in another county. The judges who received less money filed an action for declaratory judgment and argued that the disparity violated their rights to equal protection under U.S. Const. XIV amend. and N.Y. Const., art. I, &sect; 11. The judges' action named the administrative board of the state judicial conference and related officials as defendants. On cross motions for summary judgment, the supreme court granted the board's motion and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court examined the Judiciary Law and found that differences in salary levels were not based on the distinct duties of the judges at county-level courts; instead, they were based entirely on geography. Because this distinction lacked a rational basis, the court reversed and granted the judges' motion for summary judgment. Because the judges were the prevailing parties under the federal civil rights statute,&nbsp;42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the court remitted the action for a determination of attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city amended its municipal code to require that video viewing booths be open, ostensibly to prevent the spread of AIDS. Book and video store owners challenged the amendment on grounds of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The trial court denied the owners' motion for a preliminary injunction, and the court reversed. The court held that the sexually explicit but nonobscene entertainment displayed in booths at the owners' establishments was a protected form of expression under the First Amendment. The court also held that, under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, the protection afforded by the guarantees of free press and speech in the New York were often broader than the minimum required by the First Amendment. Accordingly, the court concluded that, relying upon the broad degree of protection afforded free expression by the State constitution, the owners had made a prima facie showing of their right to relief sufficient to warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction. The court further held that the owners demonstrated a likelihood of success at trial, and infringement of their constitutionally guaranteed right of free expression constituted irreparable injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and granted the book and video store owners' motion for a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the municipal code amendment during pendency of the action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Validity of Open Booth Requirement for Private Viewing of Adult Entertainment - Preliminary Injunction Plaintiffs, the owners of adult entertainment centers which offer enclosed booths for the private screening of sexually explicit movies, have made a prima facie showing pursuant to CPLR 6301 of their right to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of that part of a municipal ordinance requiring that only open booths be used for the private viewing of adult entertainment since, in the absence of proof that the open booth requirement is no broader than necessary to accomplish the legitimate governmental objective of preventing the transmission of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to the open booth requirement under the State Constitution's broad guarantee of free expression (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8).  Nothing in the record supports defendants' position that prohibiting the private viewing of motion pictures or adult entertainment in closed booths is necessary to serve their legitimate governmental objective.  Defendants have failed to sufficiently demonstrate that &quot;high-risk sexual contact&quot; has occurred in closed booths in plaintiffs' establishments and thereby threatened the public health or that plaintiffs were aware of or condoned sexual activity on their premises.  Defendants have also failed to demonstrate that less restrictive alternatives, including enforcement of the newly enacted requirements of solid walls and one person per booth, would be any less effective in meeting their objective than opening the booths to public view.  Furthermore, plaintiffs satisfied their burden of demonstrating that they will suffer irreparable injury from the infringement of their constitutionally guaranteed right of free expression if the preliminary injunction is not granted and that a balancing of the equities weighs in their favor in view of the evidence that they will sustain a significant loss of business if the open booth requirement is enforced.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff savings and loan appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), which denied the savings and loan's motion for summary judgment and granted the cross-motions of defendants, the State and City, for summary judgment. The trial court declared that interest earned on bonds issued by the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority (Authority) was not exempt from State and City franchise tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the declaration and orders of the trial court and held that N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1045-u(3), as originally enacted, did not exempt bonds issued by the Authority and the interest they generated from inclusion in the savings and loan's total net income for the purpose of calculating the savings and loan's City and State franchise tax obligations. The court stated that to rule otherwise would render &sect; 1045-u (3) discriminatory and unconstitutional under 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124(a), because the interest from the State's public authority bonds would be exempted from income used to determine franchise taxes, while the interest from comparable federal obligations would not receive a similar benefit. The court also noted that both the State and City franchise tax statutes expressly required that bond interest be included in any calculation of a corporation's entire net income. Accordingly, if the savings and loan's reading of N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1045-u(3), were to be adopted, the provision in question would conflict with N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Exemptions - Bonds Issued by New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Public Authorities Law &sect; 1045-u (3), as originally enacted, did not exempt the bonds issued by the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority and the interest they generate from inclusion in a corporate bondholder's entire net income for the purpose of calculating the corporation's New York State and New York City franchise tax obligations, since it is well established that interest paid on State revenue bonds which is exempt from direct taxation is not exempt from indirect taxation, and a franchise tax is an indirect tax.  Courts have traditionally ruled that such interest must be included in the measure of a corporation's total net income for purposes of calculating the corporation's franchise tax obligation, even when the governing statute provides that the income from a municipal bond, for example, shall at all times be free from taxation, except for estate and gift taxes and taxes on transfers.  Moreover, since 1933, the Legislature has not passed a single enabling statute whereby a public authority has been empowered to issue a revenue bond whose interest would be exempt from inclusion in the measure of a corporate holder's income for the purpose of computing its franchise taxes.  Although the statute was inartfully drafted and ambiguous, plaintiff has failed to carry its heavy burden of showing its entitlement to the claimed exemption: given that ambiguity, the court may look to the legislative history to aid in its interpretation and that history gives no indication that the bond interest would be excludable from a corporation's entire net income. Additionally, the bonds were not marketed on the basis of the unusual tax advantage asserted by plaintiff, and plaintiff's construction would conflict with other taxing statutes, would render the statutory scheme violative of Federal law, because it would result in discriminatory treatment of similar Federal obligations, and would conflict with the Tax Commissioner's interpretation, which given his expertise, should be deferred to by the courts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mayor proposed to finance the sale of the city water system to the New York City Water Board by bonds issued by the Authority. When the Comptroller refused to recommend the issuance of the bonds, the mayor and council sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the recommendation. An environmental group filed an action to prevent the sale. The court held that the there was no statutory support for the Authority to issue the proposed bonds, so the Comptroller lawfully refused to act under N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1045-o. The court held that the financing plan was unlawful because it was an unconstitutional tax. The rates paid became general revenue, so non-city rate payers did not receive a benefit from the rate they paid. The court held that the proposal was invalid under the New York Environmental Quality Review Act because no environmental impact study was performed and because it caused additional debt which might have eliminated or delayed necessary water and sewer projects. The court held that N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1045-h(1) was inconsistent with the New York City Charter provisions authorizing the sale, so state law prevailed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants for breach of contract and conversion, and sought to have defendants removed as general partners and managing agents. Defendants asserted counterclaims for the recover of the reasonable commercial value of services performed and reimbursement for expenditures. Upon defendants' demand for a trial by jury, plaintiffs moved to strike the demand on the ground that defendants had no right to a jury trial on their equitable defenses. Plaintiffs also claimed that by asserting those equitable defenses defendants waived their right to a jury on plaintiffs' legal claims. The court affirmed the order holding that (1) considering the main thrust of plaintiffs' action and the relief sought, there was no constitutional impediment to finding defendants equitable defenses must be tried in accordance with N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 4101 (2) the mere assertion by defendants of equitable defendants could not, without concomitant assertions of equitable counter claims, result in a waiver of the right to a jury, and (3) since defendants' counterclaims were not equitable, by asserting their counterclaim defendants had not waived their right to a jury trial on plaintiffs' legal claims.</SPAN></P>

Similarly, defendants' additional assertion of counterclaims for the recovery of the &quot;reasonable commercial value&quot; of their services as well as reimbursement for expenditures made for plaintiffs' benefit does not constitute a waiver of their right to a jury trial on plaintiffs' legal claims since such counterclaims seeking money damages only are predicated on principles of contract and/or quasi-contract and are thus &quot;legal&quot;, not &quot;equitable&quot; within the contemplation of CPLR 4101, notwithstanding that the rationale underlying the counterclaims is fairness and equitable principles in a general, rather than legal, sense.  Furthermore, since plaintiffs' equitable claims, including the cause of action seeking to remove defendants as general partners and managing agents of the buildings based on their alleged breach of fiduciary duty, as well as defendants' equitable defenses are so intertwined with the legal claims as to make one trial of all the causes of action appropriate, Supreme Court properly determined that the jury would serve in an advisory capacity as to those issues of fact which relate solely to the parties' equitable claims. </SPAN></P>

However, the court held that it was dispositive to its review that the statutory basis of the city department's authority in that area had been abolished by legislative enactment. In the absence of any statutory basis to act in respect to the regulation of a tissue bank, the authority of the city department was neither expressly conferred nor necessarily inferable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, assignee of a promissory note and security agreement executed by decedent, appealed from a judgment of Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which denied the assignee's summary judgment motion on its suit to recover on defaulted note and security agreement and granted defendant executor's cross motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The note required decedent, a Kansas resident, to make payments to the note holder at its New York headquarters. It also provided that New York law would govern an action to enforce the note. The security agreement provided that decedent consented to the exercise of in personam jurisdiction in New York. After decedent's death, the executor commenced probate proceedings in Kansas. Under the Kansas Probate Code, creditors who failed to file a claim with the probate court within four months from the date of a notice to creditors were barred from asserting their claims by the Kansas nonclaim statute,&nbsp;Kan. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59-2239(1). The trial court dismissed the assignee's complaint on the ground the Kansas probate statute barred its claim. The court held that New York law applied in this action and that, because the executor had failed to establish any viable defense, summary judgment should have been awarded to the assignee. Choice of law provisions were valid and enforceable in New York. Further, the U.C.C. provided that where, as here, a transaction bore a reasonable relation to New York, the parties could agree that New York law would govern their rights and duties (U.C.C. &sect; 1-105).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the lower court, reinstated the complaint and granted the assignee's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflict of Laws - Law Governing Contract Actions New York law is applicable in an action against a deceased Kansas debtor's estate seeking recovery on a debt which accrued in New York under an agreement providing that New York law would govern in any action for its enforcement.  Supreme Court erred in holding that the Kansas statute governing claims against a decedent's estate, which is not subject to any tolling provisions and which bars all claims that have not been &quot;exhibit[ed]&quot; within four months, regardless of their nature or whether they have accrued, is a substantive rule of law, rather than a purely procedural Statute of Limitations and, therefore, is here controlling.  Choice of law provisions such as those contained in the documents involved in this transaction, including the promissory note of which enforcement is sought, are valid and enforceable in this State.  Moreover, the UCC provides that as long as a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this State, the parties may agree that New York law shall govern their rights and duties (UCC 1-105).  Here, the transaction bears a reasonable relationship to New York, and no viable reason has been presented to warrant excluding the transaction from the choice of law provision agreed to by the parties.  Clearly, the relevant public policy considerations support the upholding of the New York choice of law provision agreed to by the parties with respect to enforcement of the transaction in issue.  Finally, decedent consented to personal jurisdiction in New York and to service by certified mail, and New York courts are not divested of subject matter jurisdiction by the Kansas statute which grants the Kansas probate court exclusive jurisdiction over all controversies involving Kansas estates.  Comity does not require or suggest that the courts of this State should surrender their interest in adjudicating disputes which, like this one, have significant contacts with the commerce of this State.  Since plaintiff has established that it is the holder of the note sued upon, and defendant has failed to establish that it has any viable defense, summary judgment should be awarded in plaintiff's favor.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Supplemental Retirement Allowances - Invalid Impairment of Pension Benefits Laws of 1995 (ch 119, &sect; 13), which, in response to the judicial invalidation of the Legislature's attempt in 1990 to reduce public employer contributions to the Common Retirement Fund (CRF) by mandating a new funding method for the CRF, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grants the State and municipal employers a credit, to be assessed against the assets of the supplemental reserve fund (SRF), equal to the amount of additional pension contributions they would otherwise have had to make pursuant to plaintiff State Comptroller's plan to restore funds of the CRF to the level dictated by the original funding method, is unconstitutional as violative of the Impairment Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art V, &sect; 7).  Regardless of whether the SRF is actually considered a separate fund, or merely a portion of the constitutionally protected pension accumulation fund, it is indisputably an asset of the retirement system. The Comptroller is vested with the power to hold, manage and invest the assets contained in the pension funds for the benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the retirement systems, and for the protection of the taxpayers.  It is implicit in the Constitution's assurance that pension benefits shall not be impaired, that the funds from which those benefits are drawn are to be protected, and that pension beneficiaries are entitled to the independent judgment of the Comptroller in managing the system's assets.  Since 1970, employees becoming members of the retirement system have had a right to rely on the Comptroller's independent judgment in the management of the assets comprising the SRF.  Section 13 directly infringes upon this contractual right, for it intrudes upon the Comptroller's freedom to manage the funds in the manner he considers to be most fiscally appropriate.  In addition, section 16 of the legislation, which provides that the increased supplemental retirement benefits bestowed by other provisions of the legislation be delayed in the event litigation is initiated challenging section 13, is likewise unconstitutional to the extent that the payment of benefits is conditioned solely on the existence or commencement of litigation.  However, the component of section 16 which prescribes September 1996 as an alternate effective date if section 13 is declared unconstitutional is valid and, therefore, the supplemental allowances must be paid as of that date.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the employee's cause of action, based on the date it accrued, was immediately barred under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217(2)(1) upon its effective date. While the court recognized that the legislature intended N.Y.

The court noted that the only restriction upon the legislature, in the enactment of statutes of limitation, was that a reasonable time was allowed for suits upon causes of action theretofore existing. If a statute of limitations deprived a party of a reasonable time within which suit may be brought, the court held that it violated the constitutional provision that no person should have been deprived of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer appealed a determination from respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal of the State of New York, which disallowed the taxpayer's alimony deduction because he was a not a resident of New York. The taxpayer alleged that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 631(b)(6) violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer derived substantial income in New York during 1990. As a Connecticut resident, he timely filed a nonresident New York State personal income tax return and included alimony paid to his former spouse, also a Connecticut resident. The taxpayer sought a deduction for a portion of the alimony paid. The Audit Division of the Department of Taxation and Finance (division) disallowed the deduction and issued a notice of deficiency. The taxpayer contended that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 631(b)(6) was unconstitutional. An Administrative Law Judge found that neither the division nor the Tax Appeals Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine whether a statute was unconstitutional and upheld the disallowance of the deduction. On appeal, the court annulled the determination of the Tax Appeals Tribunal and held that the statute was unconstitutional. The denial of the alimony deduction to nonresidents violated the privilege and immunity clause. Because federal policy regarding the alimony deduction recognized that tax consequences fell upon the recipients of the alimony, not the payors, there existed no substantial reason for the disparate treatment of resident and nonresident alimony payors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared the statute that treated resident and nonresident alimony payers differently was unconstitutional and annulled the determination of the Tax Appeals Tribunal that denied the taxpayer the alimony deduction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Improper Form of Action - Challenge to Constitutionality of Statute In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 to review a determination of respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal which sustained a personal income tax assessment, that portion of the proceeding which seeks a declaration that Tax Law &sect; 631 (b) (6) is unconstitutional is converted into a declaratory judgment action, as a proceeding commenced pursuant to CPLR article 78 is not the proper vehicle to challenge the constitutionality of a statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Personal Income Tax - Alimony Deduction for Nonresident Taxpayer A determination which sustained a personal income tax assessment against petitioner, a resident of Connecticut who derived substantial income in New York, and who deducted the percentage of alimony paid to his former spouse, also a Connecticut resident, which represented the amount of business income derived from or connected with this State, is annulled, and Tax Law &sect; 631 (b) (6), which provides that nonresident taxpayers may not take the alimony deduction authorized by the Internal Revenue Code (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;26 USC &sect; 215), is declared unconstitutional as violative of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the US Constitution (US Const, art IV, &sect; 2).  After the Appellate Division held Tax Law former &sect; 632 violative of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the US Constitution (US Const, art IV, &sect; 2) by denying the nonresident petitioner, employed in New York and living in Connecticut, the income tax adjustment for alimony paid to his nonresident ex-spouse ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Friedsam v State Tax Commn.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 98 AD2d 26, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">affd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;64 NY2d 76), the Court of Appeals affirmed on statutory grounds, and the Legislature enacted Tax Law &sect; 631 (b) (6), which provides express statutory authority to deny the alimony deduction to nonresidents. The addition of Tax Law &sect; 631 (b) (6) does not alter or undermine the Appellate Division's previous findings concerning the constitutionality of such practice or present a compelling reason to reach a different result on the identical legal issue. The legislative history behind Tax Law &sect; 631 (b) (6) reveals no stated reason or discussion addressing the rationale underlying a denial to only nonresidents of the alimony deduction authorized by the Internal Revenue Code in proportion with their New York income.  Since Federal policy regarding the alimony deduction recognizes that tax consequences should fall upon the recipients of the alimony, not the payors, and that denial of the deduction to a nonresident taxpayer ignores where the recipient resides or whether the recipient is taxed by this State, there is no substantial reason for the disparate treatment, leaving as the only criterion whether the payor is a resident or nonresident, and without more, there results a constitutional violation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation incurred liability for payment of special additional mortgage recording taxes. N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Refund of Unused Special Mortgage Recording Tax Credit - Due Process The 1986 amendment to Tax Law &sect; 210 (17) (former [b]), which provided, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the credit against the corporation franchise tax attributable to special additional mortgage recording tax that was due and paid in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1986 shall not be carried over to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1986, is not violative of due process merely because the amendment had the negative effect of depriving petitioner of an unused credit in the amount of $ 119,906 that had accumulated as of the close of 1985 in connection with its business of obtaining mortgages, since petitioner had no vested property right in the special additional mortgage recording tax credits it had earned, but did not use, prior to January 1, 1986.  Petitioner has no vested entitlement to a continuation of the legislative favor of permitting excess credits to be applied against future tax liabilities. The Legislature has very nearly unconstrained authority in the design of taxing impositions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Franchise Tax on Business Corporations - Refund of Unused Special Mortgage Recording Tax Credit - Equal Protection The 1986 amendment to Tax Law &sect; 210 (17) (former [b]), which provided, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the credit against the corporation franchise tax attributable to special additional mortgage recording tax that was due and paid in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1986 shall not be carried over to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1986, thereby having the negative effect of depriving petitioner of an unused credit in the amount of $ 119,906 that had accumulated as of the close of 1985 in connection with its business of obtaining mortgages, is not violative of equal protection since neither the exercise of a fundamental right nor a suspect classification is at issue, and the challenged classification is rationally related to achievement of a legitimate State purpose.  Although the statute's negative impact is limited to those corporate taxpayers carrying excess credits at the close of 1985, neither the Federal nor State Constitution requires that all taxpayers be treated identically, only that those similarly situated be treated uniformly.  Accordingly, even accepting the claim that the amendment can be viewed as &quot;singling out 1985 filers&quot;, petitioner failed to establish legislative action that distinguished between taxpayers in a fashion that was &quot;palpably arbitrary&quot; or tantamount to &quot;invidious discrimination&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the supreme court that the Speaker's decision to require a home rule message for the Secession Bill was an integral part of the legislative process, and thus a legislative act for which the legislators were immune by virtue of the Speech or Debate Clause. The court held that once a determination is made that the action is within the purview of legitimate legislative activity, the court's review must end.</SPAN></P>

The Speaker's decision to require a home rule message for the secession legislation was an integral part of the legislative process, and thus a &quot;legislative act&quot; for which respondents are immune by virtue of the Speech or Debate Clause.  There is no merit to petitioners' arguments that Speech or Debate Clause immunity begins with the onset of committee deliberations or that the Speech or Debate Clause does not shield erroneous determinations by legislators or their staffs. Judicial review must be limited to determining whether the challenged action constitutes a legitimate legislative activity.  Once a determination is made that the action is within the purview of legitimate legislative activity, the court's review must end.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executor requested a refund of estate taxes after a profit-sharing trust was removed from the estate. The Department denied the request. Trial court granted the request but calculated the amount of interest from the date of its order. The executor sought review and contended that she was entitled to interest from the date the Department received her tax payment. The court found that the executor was not entitled to the refund because the assessment error was not discovered by the executor within the two year statute of limitations, as required by N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 249-a(2). The court found that, because the executor, as the taxpayer, was seeking the refund, the six year statute of limitations was inapplicable. The court held that the differing time periods in the statute were not unconstitutional because the classification rationally furthered a legitimate state purpose.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Tax Refund - Estate Taxes - Statute of Limitations A determination by the Department of Taxation and Finance which denied petitioner executor's application for a refund of estate taxes upon the sole ground that the Statute of Limitations had run should have been confirmed. In August 1988, petitioner voluntarily made a prepayment of an estimated estate tax, and the Department issued a refund on February 16, 1989 after Surrogate's Court fixed the estate tax, subsequent to which, by a supplemental order dated November 10, 1993, Surrogate's Court granted petitioner's request to reduce the value of the estate due to removal of a profit-sharing trust from the estate, and petitioner's request for a refund based on the supplemental order was denied.  Because petitioner sought a refund based on a modified order, she was subject to the time limitations set forth in Tax Law former &sect; 249-aa (1), which provides that if after payment of any tax pursuant to an order fixing such tax, such order is modified within two years, the executor is entitled to a refund if application is made within one year from the modification. Petitioner is not entitled to the six-year limitations period of Tax Law former &sect; 249-aa (2), which provides that where a tax was paid before entry of a taxing order and such order shows that the amount of tax due is less than the amount paid, a refund is due if application sought within six years of entry of such taxing order.  Tax Law former &sect; 249-aa (2) is not applicable to applications for modifications or refunds related to such modifications. The second refund claim arises not out of a prepayment which was higher than the first order fixing the tax, but rather from a subsequent action that petitioner took to change the value of the estate.  Therefore, Tax Law former &sect; 249-aa (2), which speaks to an overpayment made because a prepayment exceeded the amount fixed by the first order, does not apply.  Here, the taxpayer is seeking correction of the first order, and such a taxpayer is not in the same situation as one who claims a refund based on an original order, where only the ministerial act of filing for the refund is required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Estate Tax Refund - Statute of Limitations A determination by the Department of Taxation and Finance which denied petitioner executor's application for a refund of estate taxes upon the sole ground that the Statute of Limitations had run should have been confirmed. In August 1988, petitioner voluntarily made a prepayment of an estimated estate tax, and the Department issued a refund on February 16, 1989 after Surrogate's Court fixed the estate tax, subsequent to which, by a supplemental order dated November 10, 1993, Surrogate's Court granted petitioner's request to reduce the value of the estate due to removal of a profit-sharing trust from the estate, and petitioner's request for a refund based on the supplemental order was denied.

Petitioner is not entitled to the six-year limitations period of Tax Law former &sect; 249-aa (2), which provides that where a tax was paid before entry of a taxing order and such order shows that the amount of tax due is less than the amount paid, a refund is due if sought within six years of entry of such taxing order.  The differing time periods do not violate equal protection rights since rational policy reasons justify the different treatment accorded taxpayers under Tax Law former &sect; 249-aa (1) and (2).  Inasmuch as the two sections of the statute apply to two discrete categories of taxpayers--those who seek a refund based on an amended or corrected order and those who do not--the two groups are not identically situated.  The longer time period under the second section is rationally related to a legitimate State interest in that it encourages taxpayers to make a timely estimated payment, and if that amount exceeds what is actually due, the taxpayer is given six years to seek a refund. This also encourages taxpayers to be diligent in establishing the worth of an estate because if the original order must be modified, the limitations period will be decreased.  Requiring that a request for modification be made within two years furthers the interests of finality, especially if a taxpayer expects the modification to generate a refund. </SPAN></P>

Tax Law &sect; 301 facially discriminatory against interstate commerce, and awarded the tug boats costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state conducted an audit of the tug boats for the period January 1984 through August 1990, at the conclusion of which the state issued an assessment in an aggregate amount including interest and penalties, pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law art. 13-A, commonly known as the Tax on Petroleum Businesses, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 300 et seq. The assessment was based upon a finding that, during the relevant period, the tug boats purchased fuel in New Jersey and thereafter imported and consumed such fuel in New York without paying the requisite &quot;privilege&quot; tax pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 301. The trial court granted the tug boats' application to the extent that it canceled the notices of deficiency, declared N.Y.

The tax did impermissibly burden the tug boats, and the tax violated the Commerce Clause. The court struck only N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Petroleum Gross Receipts Tax - Commerce Clause In a proceeding brought by petitioners, corporations which provide barge and/or towing services using vessels powered by petroleum fuel purchased from out-of-State suppliers, seeking cancellation of notices of deficiency issued by the Department of Taxation and Finance based upon findings that petitioners had purchased fuel in New Jersey and thereafter imported and consumed such fuel in this State without paying the requisite &quot;privilege&quot; tax pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 301, the notices of deficiency are cancelled and Tax Law &sect; 301 (a) (1) (ii) is declared unconstitutional as facially discriminatory against interstate commerce. Respondent Commissioner of Taxation and Finance's argument that the tax imposed by Tax Law &sect; 301 (a) (1) (ii) upon the purchasers and consumers of imported petroleum is also imposed upon the in-State purchasers and consumers of domestic petroleum because the sellers of domestic petroleum, who pay a use tax, &quot;pass through&quot; such tax to the in-State consumers in the form of higher prices, is premised upon the assumption, if not speculation, that the use tax paid by the in-State seller of domestic petroleum is equal to the tax imposed upon petitioners and those similarly situated, and such in-State seller will &quot;pass along&quot; the full amount of the use tax it paid to its customers, thereby negating the effect of, or offsetting, the burden imposed upon petitioners and those similarly situated by Tax Law &sect; 301 (a) (1) (ii).  Although the &quot;pass through&quot; theory has been recognized as a way of shifting tax expenses to in-State consumers by way of increased prices, unless respondent's assumptions are transformed into economic reality, in-State sellers of domestic petroleum remain benefited while petitioners and those similarly situated remain burdened, thereby leading to the conclusion that the tax at issue violates the Commerce Clause.  Inasmuch as petitioners are not entitled to offset the sales tax paid in New Jersey or to any other out-of-State supplier against the tax imposed by Tax Law &sect; 301 (a) (1) (ii), this provision results in multiple taxation and, as such, fails the internal consistency test, and results in impermissible interference with free trade. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, registered voters and taxpayers, appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Chemung County (New York), which granted respondent school district's motion to dismiss their petition seeking a declaratory judgment that the adoption of an austerity budget violated various provisions of the New York and United States Constitutions, and to declare N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district adopted an austerity budget for a particular school year and voted to levy the necessary taxes pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2023 after two proposed budgets were rejected by the voters. The voters and taxpayers' action seeking declaratory judgment was dismissed by the trial court and they appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 was intended to regulate the qualifications of voters, not regulate the mode of elections. Accordingly the authorization for passage of an austerity budget, contained in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2023, did not abridge their right to a meaningful vote. The court also found no constitutional infirmity in the statute in that the challenged provisions were found to be reasonable in relation to their subject and adopted in the interests of the community. The court noted that the legislature had an obligation to provide and support public education and that &sect; 2023 provided the mechanism to enforce that obligation. The court found all arguments raised by the taxpayers to lack merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner brought a proceeding under N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 25-0404 to review respondent environmental conservation department's denial of a building permit. The Supreme Court in Suffolk County (New York) denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding, holding that the landowner could use the property for recreational purposes and that he was aware of its wetlands status when he purchased it. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner paid $ 100,000 cash for the property, $ 90,000 of which was used to discharge a federal tax lien. He testified that he was aware that most of the land had been inventoried as tidal wetlands. The court rejected the landowner's argument that the denial of the building permit diminished the value of his property from $ 396,000, its value as a buildable lot, to nothing, writing that the $ 100,000 purchase price reflected the environmental restrictions on the property. Thus, it held, it was unreasonable for the landowner to assume that he was purchasing the full unrestricted residential value of the property, and the trial court's conclusion that a &quot;taking&quot; did not occur upon the denial of the building permit should not be disturbed. It rejected the landowner's argument that the denial prevented him from using his property for any purpose, including recreational pursuits, stating that evidence indicated that local authorities would grant the permits necessary for the construction of a dock and catwalk on the parcel. Moreover, it noted, the landowner himself withdrew his variance application. Thus, it held, the economic value of the land had not been destroyed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Tidal Wetlands - Building Permit Petitioner, who purchased property with the full knowledge that it had been designated protected tidal wetlands, cannot claim that a regulatory taking occurred when he was denied a building permit for a residence since he did not have a reasonable investment-backed expectation that he would be able to build a residence on his parcel. Petitioner asserts that until the building permit was denied by respondent there was always the possibility that he would be able to construct a residence on the parcel, and that it was not until that denial that he was made to suffer a regulatory taking which diminished the value of his property from $ 396,000 (its value as a buildable lot) to nothing.  Petitioner's claim that, during his tenure of ownership, his property was worth $ 396,000 is belied by the $ 100,000 purchase price he paid for the property, a recent sale of a subject parcel generally being the &quot;best evidence&quot; of the parcel's value.  Petitioner's argument that he will be unable to use his property for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">any</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> purpose is without merit; there was evidence that local authorities would grant the appropriate variances and permits so as to allow the construction of a dock and catwalk on the parcel, and petitioner failed to meet his burden of proving that he would be unable to use his parcel for recreational purposes because the appropriate permits and variances would not be granted.  Petitioner's withdrawal of his variance application prior to a decision of the Village Zoning Board is a probative fact militating against petitioner's claimed inability to utilize his property for any purpose.  It cannot be said that Supreme Court erred when it determined that the economic value of the land had not been destroyed and that it retained significant value for recreational use. The amount petitioner paid for the property is strong proof of what his investment-backed expectations were at the time of the purchase.  Petitioner, as a knowledgeable buyer, adjusted his purchase price to &quot;offset&quot; the restrictions that he knew had been placed on the property, and to give credence to petitioner's claim of a taking and grant his application for compensation would be to afford him a windfall that the law never intended taxpayers to shoulder.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 to review a determination of respondent New York State Department of Social Services (department), which denied his request to have his name expunged from the New York State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment (register). The father alleged that N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 422(8) was unconstitutional in that its &quot;some credible evidence&quot; standard violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The register received several reports that the father had maltreated his two daughters. Subsequent investigations indicated against the father. He later requested that the reports be expunged from the register. After the register denied his request, the father sought a fair hearing pursuant to &sect; 422(8). The department determined that some credible evidence existed to support the records and thus denied the expungement request. The father brought a Rule 78 proceeding for review of the determination, arguing that the &quot;some credible evidence&quot; standard violated due process. The court annulled the determination and remitted to the department. The court held that pursuant to its recent decision in another case, due process protection warranted replacement of the &quot;some credible evidence&quot; standard used in administrative expungement hearings with a higher &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard. Because the inclusion of the father's name on the register implicated a liberty interest protected by due process by placing a burden on his desired adoption prospects, the department's failure to use the higher standard was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The bus driver testified that he raised the student up and sat him back down in an effort to quiet him. The bus driver contended that N.Y. Civ. Serv.

The court remitted the case to the school board for imposition of an appropriate penalty, finding that termination was disproportionate to the offense. The findings of misconduct and insubordination were amply supported by the evidence adduced at the hearing. The resolution stated several grounds for the school board's determination and was read aloud at the meeting, which the bus driver attended. However, the school board did not give sufficient weight to mitigating factors warranting imposition of a lesser penalty. Those factors included the bus driver's above-average overall work performance evaluations and the student's consistent misbehavior problems both in the classroom and on the school bus.</SPAN></P>

The officials challenged the constitutionality of the credit mechanism, which they characterized as a &quot;raid&quot; on the pension fund, as well as ch. 119, &sect; 16, which conditioned the commencement date of the benefit increase on the existence, and outcome, of any litigation challenging the credit provision. The officials contended that &sect; 16 was an illegal attempt to insulate the law from any constitutional challenge or to &quot;punish&quot; the retirees for bringing such a challenge. The court held that the officials did not show that the denial of the request for an injunction would cause them to suffer any injury that was not compensable by money damages. Section 16 did not directly prevent the officials from bringing suit but merely required, as a condition of their exercise of the right to do so, that they forfeit certain monetary benefits.

Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the credit mechanism (L 1995, ch 119, &sect; 13), which they characterize as a &quot;raid&quot; on the pension fund, as well as that of section 16 of chapter 119, which conditions the commencement date of the benefit increase on the existence, and outcome, of any litigation challenging section 13.  While plaintiffs contend that section 16 of chapter 119 improperly conditions the receipt of benefits upon the waiver of their constitutional right to petition the courts for redress and that such an impairment is all that need be shown to establish irreparable injury, even assuming that plaintiffs have established a likelihood that they will succeed in demonstrating that section 16 is constitutionally infirm, that fact is not sufficient to justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction, for section 16 does not directly prevent them from bringing suit, but merely requires, as a condition of their exercise of the right to do so, that they forfeit certain monetary benefits.  As this loss can be fully redressed by a monetary award, should their challenge succeed, preliminary injunctive relief is not warranted.  As for plaintiffs' argument that irreparable harm is manifest because it is highly probable that many of the retirees will die before receiving the supplemental allowances, if such an allegation were sufficient to demonstrate irremediable injury, that requirement would be satisfied in virtually every case, for any individual plaintiff bears the risk that he or she may expire before the matter is resolved.  Absent extraordinary circumstances, not shown to be present here, a mere delay in payment of an additional benefit is not the kind of injury that warrants the awarding of equitable relief. </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 16-104 and for declaratory judgment, petitioners sought review of an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which granted a motion by respondent State Board of Elections (New York) dismissing petitioners' fourth claim. The Board appealed an order of the same court granting petitioners' application to annul a proposition to amend N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 10, 11, 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New York's legislature sent a resolution to amend the state Constitution to the Board, which sent the proposal to the county election boards. Petitioners commenced an action challenging the proposal, alleging that the Board violated N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 4-108(2) by treating the proposed amendments as a single proposition, and that the form of submission failed to clearly and concisely state the proposition's purpose and effect. Petitioners also sought a declaration that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 4-116 (amended 1993) unconstitutionally reduced the number of publishing newspapers to one per county. The trial court dismissed petitioners' latter claim and otherwise granted the petition. The Board appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the petition. The court found that the proposed amendments' interrelationship required their submission as a single proposition, noting that separate submissions could have resulted in an ineffective or absurd result. The court rejected the contention that the proposition was ambiguous, noting that the Board had amply met the requirements of N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 4-108(1)(d) by presenting the proposition's purpose and effect in a clear and concise manner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Constitutional Amendment - Publication Requirement In a combined proceeding and action challenging the wording of the text, abstract and form of a proposition to amend five sections of article VII of the NY Constitution with respect to the State's ability to contract certain debt, Supreme Court properly dismissed petitioners' claim that a 1993 amendment to Election Law &sect; 4-116 (L 1993, ch 60, &sect; 5), which reduced the publication period for propositions from two weeks to one week prior to election and which reduced the number of publishing newspapers from two per county to one per county, is unconstitutional.  NY Constitution, article XIX, &sect; 1, which provides that it shall be the duty of the Legislature to submit proposed amendments to the people for approval in such manner and at such times as the Legislature shall prescribe, clearly gives the Legislature the prerogative to designate the procedure to be used in submitting proposed amendments to the voters. The Legislature was acting within this authority in amending the publication requirements contained in Election Law &sect; 4-116.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Constitutional Amendment - Form of Proposition Supreme Court erred in declaring the text, abstract and form of a proposition to amend five sections of article VII of the NY Constitution with respect to the State's ability to contract certain debt to be null and void. When, as here, a proposed constitutional amendment is to be submitted to the voters in a general election, the State Board of Elections is to transmit to each County Board of Elections a certified copy of the text of each amendment, proposition or question and a statement of the form in which it is to be submitted, and if more than one such amendment, proposition or question is to be voted upon, each such amendment, proposition or question shall be separately and consecutively numbered (Election Law &sect; 4-108).  While petitioners contend that because five sections of NY Constitution article VII were proposed to be amended the State Board was required to set forth five separate and consecutively numbered corresponding propositions, Election Law &sect; 4-108 speaks in terms of the proposed &quot;amendment, proposition or question&quot; to be submitted to the voters, and viewed as a whole, implicitly acknowledges that numerous proposed amendments may be presented as a single &quot;proposition&quot; or &quot;question&quot;.  Further, the proposed amendments herein are contextually interrelated to such a degree that they must stand or fall together to have any effect.  The submission of five separate propositions could theoretically result in the approval of some, but not all, of the interrelated proposed amendments, and the approval of three of the amendments, which contain cross references to the two other proposed additions would have an absurd result if the latter additions were not approved; they would cross reference nonexistent provisions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Constitutional Amendment - Form of Abstract In a combined proceeding and action challenging the wording of the text, abstract and form of a proposition to amend five sections of article VII of the NY Constitution with respect to the State's ability to contract certain debt, there is no merit to petitioners' claims that the abstract certified by the State Board of Elections fails to concisely state the purpose and effect of the proposed amendments in &quot;a clear and coherent manner using words with common and everyday meanings&quot; as required by Election Law &sect; 4-108 (1) (d), and that the form of submission certified by the State Board fails to indicate the subject matter of the proposed amendments &quot;in a clear and coherent manner&quot; as required by Election Law &sect; 4-108 (2).  The abstract clearly and coherently conveys the purpose and effect of the proposition; the first line states that the purpose of the proposal is to revise the State's borrowing practices, and balance of the abstract briefly outlines, in understandable language, the proposed changes and the effect of those changes.  Similarly, the form of submission has an abbreviated title which clearly and coherently indicates the subject matter of the proposal.  While the State Board arguably could have worded the form of submission in a number of different ways, the paragraph which describes the proposal concisely and accurately sets forth, in understandable terms, a brief summary of that which is set forth in the text and abstract.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, thereby upholding the statute. It held that plaintiffs had failed to prove that the purpose of the statute was to favor certain interests in the construction industry. Instead, what was established was that the law was one that ultimately favored the taxpayers, and thus there was a valid state interest in regulating public works contracts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser was interested in buying certain real property within the city and applied to the board for a special use permit in order that he might construct a take-out/carry-out restaurant comprised of three separate food franchises with a common eating area.

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and, noting that the provisions of the zoning ordinance regarding parking had been amended, remitted the matter to the board, where it was again denied.

The purchaser sought a declaratory judgment action seeking to annul the board's determination and have the provision of the zoning ordinance defining &quot;take-out, carry-out restaurant&quot; declared void for vagueness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient consulted a gynecologist about options for terminating her pregnancy and signed a consent form which she acknowledged, during her deposition testimony, that she had read and fully understood. After the procedure the patient suffered extensive bleeding and was treated for a perforation of her uterus. The patient charged the physician with malpractice in failing to obtain plaintiff's informed consent before the procedure was undertaken. In asserting the cause of action for lack of informed consent, plaintiff argued that she was not a proper candidate for the procedure, that it violated her religious beliefs, and that she should have been talked out of it. The physician moved for summary judgment, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court. The court held that the evidence in this case showed that the patient was specifically told of the risk of sadness and depression and the possibility of serious depression as a result of an abortion.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Physicians and Surgeons - Lack of Informed Consent In a medical malpractice action, defendant doctor's motion to dismiss plaintiff's cause of action for lack of informed consent should have been granted.  Plaintiff, who suffered extensive bleeding and was treated for a perforation of her uterus following a second trimester abortion performed by defendants, was specifically told that once dilators were inserted into her cervix she was committed to completing the procedure, and when she returned the following day, defendant doctor, without further discussion with plaintiff, completed the procedure.  Plaintiff had been advised of the possible risks of hemorrhage and perforation, and was specifically told of the risk of sadness and depression and the possibility of serious depression as a result of an abortion. There can be no claim that plaintiff was persuaded to have an abortion that was, without her knowledge, &quot;needless&quot; according to her own convictions; she cannot seek to hold defendant liable because her personal convictions have apparently changed since she consented to and underwent the procedure.  While plaintiff argues that an attempt should have been made to talk her out of the abortion and that because she was in a &quot;crisis pregnancy&quot; she should have been referred to several days of independent counseling, these are not permissible requirements.  Plaintiff was thoroughly advised of the risks and alternatives to her abortion and she gave her informed consent to the procedure; there is no merit to the contention that defendant, who first saw plaintiff on the day after the dilators had initially been inserted was negligent because he did not advise her again of all the risks, both physical and emotional, and did not seek at that point to dissuade her from completing the abortion procedure which it is claimed may not have been irreversible. The extensive information and counseling given to plaintiff by the clinic personnel provided her with all the necessary information to enable her to make the requisite knowledgeable decision and defendant's reliance thereon fulfilled his obligations in that regard.  </SPAN></P>

Admin. Code &sect; 11-602(8)(b)(3) (1986), also known as Local Law No. 3, unconstitutional, insofar as it prohibited deduction of petroleum taxes imposed pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 301 in determining the general corporation tax liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted art. 13-A of the Tax Law, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 301, which imposed a petroleum tax on oil companies, and amended art. 9-A of the Tax Law, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 208(9)(b)(4), to disallow the deductibility of the petroleum tax from the corporate taxpayer's income. The New York City Council enacted Local Law No. 3 to conform the city tax law. The state legislature then amended both articles by deleting the disallowance of petroleum tax for purposes of the franchise tax, but the city did not amend the administrative code. The oil companies brought an action alleging that the city had to amend the local law to comport with the state law. The trial court declared Local Law No. 3 unconstitutional, and on appeal the court affirmed, holding that the local law imposing taxes on general corporations should substantially follow the model local law contained in the enabling act, 1966 N.Y. Laws ch. 772, &sect; 1, or it may depart from the model local law to impose a tax that conformed with art. 9-A. The court determined that the local law was intrinsically subordinate to and had to comport with any specifically reference state law.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimant initiated a third-party action against third-party respondent publishing company. The trial court referred all of the claims to a special referee to hear and report on the accounts. The court also granted the motion to dismiss appellant's third-party complaint as abandoned. On appeal, the court affirmed the referral and the dismissal of appellant's third-party complaint.

To direct the Board to return the money to the different sources would not serve a legitimate purpose and would engender a situation fertile for the filing of numerous, additional lawsuits. Moreover, since all of the necessary parties with claims to the funds are within the court's jurisdiction and since the IAS Court is the proper forum in which to resolve the competing claims, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny appellant's request to direct the return of the money to the payors.  Furthermore, an appellate court will not ordinarily interfere with the discretion of the trial courts in referring a matter to a Special Referee to hear and report, especially where, as here, no substantial right of any party is affected.  </SPAN></P>

Since the statute, prior to its invalidation, was continually upheld by various State and Federal Courts, the Board cannot be held liable for enforcing a statute that was later found to be unconstitutional where that unconstitutionality was not plain.  </SPAN></P>

Lastly, appellant's contention that the IAS Court's decision to impose a $ 200 sanction upon him was improper also lacks merit since the $ 200, rather than a sanction, is merely a normal assessment of costs.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Petitioner had been assessed tax on a gain from the sale of property, plus a penalty and interest, that it considered excessive. Petitioner noted that other joint owners had been involved in the same sale of property, but their basis was lower than the co-owners (and thus their gain greater) due to the nature of their transaction. The other owners were allowed to use fair market value, whereas petitioner was not since it sold its interest to a housing cooperative. Petitioner contended that this difference constituted an unconstitutional difference that violated its equal protection rights.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Real Property Transfer Gains Tax - Cooperative Conversion Where petitioner, a limited partnership, acquired an apartment building in 1976 for $ 5,750,000, sold the building to a cooperative housing corporation (CHC) in 1982 for $ 15,773,302.20 with part of the consideration consisting of unsold shares of the CHC valued at $ 6,935,162.57, and then between March 28, 1983 (the effective date of Tax Law art 31-B) and September 1986, sold shares to individual tenant/shareholders valued at $ 4,832,602, respondent Department of Taxation and Finance properly determined that petitioner had a gain on the sale of shares based on the price it initially paid for the property and thus owed a 10% real property transfer tax on the gain (Tax Law &sect; 1441) in the amount of $ 445,581 plus a penalty of $ 72,634 and interest of $ 40,174.  The fact that petitioner's &quot;original purchase price&quot; is different from that of its individual partners on the sale of the same stock of the CHC for purposes of the transfer gains tax because of the &quot;exception&quot; for pre-March 29, 1983 transfers, which allows the partners' original purchase price to be &quot;stepped up&quot; to the value of the shares at the time of the transfers (20 NYCRR former 590.35 [f], renum 590.36 [f], eff Nov. 9, 1994), does not violate petitioner's equal protection rights.  The challenged regulation advances a legitimate State interest by shielding that portion of the partners' gain which preceded the effective date of Tax Law article 31-B from the gains tax. In addition, allowing petitioner to &quot;step up&quot; its original purchase price of the property to its fair market value at the time of transfer to the CHC would contravene the well-settled principle that a cooperative conversion is a single transfer for gains tax purposes with the gain being measured by the difference between the consideration received upon the sale of the shares and the transferor's cost of acquiring the property prior to its transfer to the CHC.  </SPAN></P>

The fact that different tax consequences arise from the sale of the CHC shares to tenant/shareholders and the sale of shares of a noncooperative corporation that owns real estate does not violate petitioner's equal protection rights since the Legislature may constitutionally apply a different tax treatment to condominium and cooperative developers than it applies to other types of real estate developers. </SPAN></P>

Petitioner is not entitled to an abatement of the penalty imposed for its failure to timely pay the transfer gains tax (Tax Law &sect; 1446 [2] [b]).  Since petitioner could have readily ascertained its tax liability based upon respondent's 1983 publication stating that, for purposes of the gains tax, the original purchase price used in calculating the gain on the sale of cooperative shares &quot;is the original purchase price ... in the hands of the realty transferor&quot;, there is no reason to disturb the determination of the Tax Appeals Tribunal sustaining the penalty imposed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a ticket broker and its president, sought review of an order and judgment of the Supreme Court in Westchester County (New York), which denied their motion to dismiss and granted the petition for a permanent injunction against their continued violation of New York's ticket-scalping statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Arts and Cult. Aff. Law &sect; 25.01 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court initially held that broker and president were subject to the jurisdiction of the New York courts even though neither one was a New York resident. New York's long-arm statute,&nbsp;N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302, permitted its courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nondomiciliary who contracted anywhere to supply goods or services in the state. Proof of one transaction in New York was sufficient to invoke jurisdiction, so long as a defendant's activities were purposeful and there was a substantial relationship between the transaction and the claim asserted. The court noted that in the instant case, broker had contracted, via telephone, to resell tickets to New York residents and shipped those tickets into New York. The court then upheld the constitutionality of the ticket-scalping statute, as the regulation of ticket sales to protect the public against fraud was a legitimate government interest and did not offend notions of due process. The court concluded that the imposition of injunctive relief under the valid statute was appropriate, noting that the statute violated neither the Equal Protection Clause nor the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer Protection - &quot;Ticket Scalping&quot; - Personal Jurisdiction over Nonresident Ticket Sellers A violation of New York's &quot;ticket scalping&quot; law (Arts and Cultural Affairs Law &sect; 25.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which prohibits reselling or offering to resell tickets to any place of entertainment in New York for more than the &quot;maximum premium price&quot; permitted except for certain exempt ticket sellers, provides a proper basis for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents engaged in the business of reselling entertainment tickets at places of entertainment located in New York in a proceeding commenced by the Attorney-General pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 63 (12) to enjoin &quot;repeated&quot; illegal acts and obtain restitution for eligible consumers where defendants had certain minimum contacts with New York.  In this case, when the corporate defendant, a Connecticut corporation, contracted to send tickets to purchasers located in New York for New York events at prices far in excess of the &quot;maximum premium price&quot;, it was subjecting itself to personal jurisdiction for any cause of action that arose out of those contracts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 302 [a] [1]).  Moreover, defendant purposefully availed itself of business opportunities in New York by advertising in New York newspapers, maintaining two New York telephone numbers, reselling tickets for New York events to New York residents, and actually shipping those tickets into New York.  These acts are clearly sufficient to establish the minimum contacts with this State necessary to satisfy constitutional due process requirements as well as to place defendant squarely within the reach of New York's long-arm statute.  Furthermore, Supreme Court properly concluded that it had personal jurisdiction over the individual defendant, the president of the corporate defendant.  Since the record establishes the existence of sufficient minimum contacts to subject the individual defendant to personal jurisdiction in the New York courts pursuant to CPLR 302 (a) (1), he may not hide behind the corporate entity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer Protection - &quot;Ticket Scalping&quot; - Constitutionality of &quot;Ticket Scalping&quot; Law - Due Process New York's &quot;ticket scalping&quot; law (Arts and Cultural Affairs Law &sect; 25.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which prohibits reselling or offering to resell tickets to any place of entertainment in New York for more than the &quot;maximum premium price&quot; permitted except for certain exempt ticket sellers, does not violate the Due Process Clause.  The regulation of ticket sales to protect the public against fraud, extortion, exorbitant rates and similar abuses is a legitimate governmental interest and does not offend any notions of due process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer Protection - &quot;Ticket Scalping&quot; - Constitutionality of &quot;Ticket Scalping&quot; Law - Equal Protection New York's &quot;ticket scalping&quot; law (Arts and Cultural Affairs Law &sect; 25.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which prohibits reselling or offering to resell tickets to any place of entertainment in New York for more than the &quot;maximum premium price&quot; permitted except for certain exempt ticket sellers, does not violate the Equal Protection Clause in distinguishing between the resale prices that may be charged by different classes of ticket sellers. The statute treats all ticket brokers alike while exempting certain other classes of ticket sellers from the application of the &quot;maximum premium price&quot; that may be charged such as theater owners and not-for-profit corporations.  The statute makes a valid distinction between those who would lawfully recover their expenses and those who would gain substantial profits from the unlawful reselling of tickets. Furthermore, the exemption of not-for-profit organizations is rationally related to the legitimate government interest in the promotion of charitable activities.  Thus, so long as the subject entity wholly dedicates the profits realized from the resale of tickets to the purpose for which it was granted &quot;exempt&quot; status, it is acting within the specific exemptions of the statute and in accordance with the legitimate government interest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer Protection - &quot;Ticket Scalping&quot; - Constitutionality of &quot;Ticket Scalping&quot; Law - Commerce Clause New York's &quot;ticket scalping&quot; law (Arts and Cultural Affairs Law &sect; 25.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which prohibits reselling or offering to resell tickets to any place of entertainment in New York for more than the &quot;maximum premium price&quot; permitted except for certain exempt ticket sellers, is not violative of the Commerce Clause since the statutory scheme regulates evenhandedly and does not seek to regulate activity that occurs wholly outside the State.  The regulation of the resale of tickets within the State is a legitimate exercise of the State's power to protect the interests of its populace which clearly does not unduly burden interstate commerce.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant nonprofit religious company sought review from a Supreme Court of Westchester County (New York) judgment dismissing its application in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding to declare a zoning amendment enacted by appellees town board and others requiring a 50-foot buffer zone around its property unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After earlier proceedings between a nonprofit religious company, a town board, and others terminated in a settlement between the parties reserving only the nonprofit religious company's right to contest a proposed 50-foot buffer zoning requirement in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding, the nonprofit religious company commenced such a proceeding challenging an amendment to the zoning ordinance requiring such a 50-foot buffer zone. The lower court found against the nonprofit religious company and the nonprofit religious company appealed. The court found that (1) the failure to appeal from an interlocutory order did not waive the arguments at issue because of the later appeal from the lower court's judgment, (2) the conduct of the nonprofit religious company's attorneys at a public hearing demonstrated that the only right not waived was that of contesting the size of the buffer zone, (3) all constitutional and other claims against the buffer zone not attacking the size of the buffer zone were thus waived, (4) the zoning ordinance had been a proper use of police powers and furthered legitimate governmental purposes, and (5) therefore the lower court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment against the nonprofit religious company and in favor of the town board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Appeal as of Right In a proceeding to declare a zoning amendment unconstitutional, since the proceeding was commenced as a CPLR article 78 proceeding and was not converted to an action, the interlocutory order denying petitioner's motion to strike respondents' answer was not appealable as of right ( CPLR 5701 [b] [1]).  In any event, petitioner's appeal from the judgment brings the interlocutory order up for review ( CPLR 5501 [a] [1]), and thus respondents' reliance on petitioner's failure to appeal the interlocutory order is misplaced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Creation of 50-Foot Buffer Screening Zone in Residential Districts - No Interference with Free Exercise of Religion - Waiver A zoning amendment enacted by respondent Town, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> requires that a 50-foot buffer screening area be maintained with existing vegetation and natural features along all perimeter boundaries of properties used for permitted nonresidential uses in residential districts, furthers the legitimate governmental purposes of preserving the residential character of the neighborhood and preventing noise and disturbance and thus constitutes a valid exercise of the Town's police power. Petitioner, a not-for-profit religious corporation that owns 25 acres in a residential district, may challenge only the size of the buffer zone created by the Town since it waived all constitutional and other legal challenges to the validity of the buffer requirement itself by conceding, following the settlement of its Federal civil rights action against the Town, that it &quot;would not object to a provision of a buffer of some reasonable dimension from the property line&quot;.  Petitioner has not met its heavy burden of demonstrating that the size of the buffer interferes with the free exercise of religion of its members to engage in a religious practice known as work practice, which involves silent meditation in the course of working in the care and maintenance of petitioner's property.  Furthermore, the buffer requirement does not exclude petitioner's religious use of its property, and the fact that respondent's zoning ordinance imposes different buffer requirements in other districts does not affect the reasonableness of the 50-foot requirement in the residential district where petitioner's property is located, especially in view of the evidence concerning disputes between petitioner and one of its neighbors about petitioner's activities near the boundary.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actions - Conversion of One Form of Action to Another In a proceeding, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to declare a zoning amendment unconstitutional, since petitioner's challenge focuses on the application of the zoning amendment to its property, there is no need to convert the proceeding to a declaratory judgment action. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc.

The agency sought to use the condemned property for the development of a retail shopping center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After signing an environmental assessment form for the development project, the lead agency accepted the draft environmental impact statement (EIS) and the public comment period under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) commenced. The final EIS was filed and the lead agency issued its findings and determination to acquire the landowners' property. The court rejected the landowners' claim that the statutory condemnation scheme was facially unconstitutional. The court concluded that (1) pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 862(2)(b) the project was exempt from the retail establishment prohibition because the project was located in a highly distressed area as defined in N.Y. Gen. Law &sect; 854(18); (2) that the lead agency's acquisition of the landowners' property served a legitimate public purpose; and (3) that the lead agency had control over the ultimate decision on the project and did not contract away its power of eminent domain. However, the lead agency failed to comply with SEQRA because its site-specific SEQRA review resulted in improper segmentation and the lead agency failed to review the cumulative effect of all phases of the redevelopment plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The statutory condemnation scheme granting an industrial development agency (IDA) the power to condemn property (General Municipal Law &sect; 858 [4]), pursuant to which respondent IDA proposes to acquire petitioner oil companies' properties for the construction of a retail shopping center by a private developer as part of a larger redevelopment plan for the Syracuse lakefront, is not facially unconstitutional.  There is no violation of substantive due process so long as the governmental agency takes the property for a public purpose and provides the owner with just compensation.  Furthermore, respondent's agreement with the developer to provide funding for the condemnation is in accord with statutory procedure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;EDPL 304) and constitutes a certain and adequate source and manner of just compensation.  </SPAN></P>

Respondent industrial development agency's (IDA) proposed taking of petitioner oil companies' properties pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 858 (4) for the development of a retail shopping center by a private developer as part of a larger redevelopment plan for the Syracuse lakefront is not violative of the general statutory prohibition against IDA funding of retail projects (General Municipal Law &sect; 862, as amended by L 1993, ch 356) since the project is located in a &quot;highly distressed area&quot; in view of the area's poverty and unemployment rate (General Municipal Law &sect; 854 [18]) and is thus specifically exempt from the retail establishment prohibition (General Municipal Law &sect; 862 [2] [b]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Industrial Development Agencies - Validity of Condemnation for Construction of Retail Shopping Center </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondent industrial development agency's proposed taking of petitioner oil companies' properties pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 858 (4) for the development of a retail shopping center by a private developer as part of a larger redevelopment plan for the Syracuse lakefront serves the legitimate public purposes of reducing urban physical and economic blight and promoting economic revitalization of the acquisition site and will thus be sustained in a proceeding pursuant to EDPL 207.  The fact that the developer will benefit privately from the project does not invalidate the agency's determination since the public purposes for the project are dominant.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Industrial Development Agencies - Validity of Condemnation for Construction of Retail Shopping Center - Failure to Raise Issue of Excess Taking in Condemnation Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Petitioner, whose property was included in respondent industrial development agency's proposed taking of properties pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 858 (4) for the development of a retail shopping center by a private developer as part of a larger redevelopment plan for the Syracuse lakefront, cannot challenge the taking of its property as being excess to the shopping center project in a proceeding to review the proposed condemnation pursuant to EDPL 207, since it failed to raise the issue during the condemnation proceedings.  Furthermore, the fact that the project would create competition with other existing retail establishments does not invalidate the proposed condemnation as being contrary to the legislative intent to prohibit the use of industrial development funds to &quot;cannibalize&quot; one area of the State at the expense of another since the project is located in a &quot;highly distressed area&quot; (General Municipal Law &sect; 854 [18]) and is thus expressly countenanced by General Municipal Law &sect; 862 (2) (b).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Industrial Development Agencies - Validity of Condemnation for Construction of Retail Shopping Center - &quot;Contracting Away&quot; of Agency's Eminent Domain Power </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Respondent industrial development agency did not illegally &quot;contract away&quot; its eminent domain power (General Municipal Law &sect; 858 [4]) by entering into an agreement with a private developer under which the developer agreed to provide funding for the construction of a retail shopping center on the site of petitioners' condemned properties as part of a larger redevelopment plan for the Syracuse lakefront. Respondent intended to condemn the properties and merely entered into an agreement with a private developer to ensure that the properties would be developed in the anticipated beneficial manner.  While the developer may influence respondent's decision with respect to what properties will be condemned, the agreement clearly establishes that the condemnation decision is respondent's and respondent's alone.  The steps articulated in the agreement ensure that respondent will not condemn petitioners' properties without adequate compensatory resources.  Furthermore, the language in the agreement suggesting that respondent will condemn the properties upon the developer's final commitment to the redevelopment project does not amount to an impermissible bargaining away of the governmental entity's power of eminent domain. </SPAN></P>

Respondent's site-specific SEQRA review of the shopping center project improperly segmented the environmental review of that project from other &quot;reasonably related&quot; lakefront projects and failed to consider the secondary and cumulative effects of such projects </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;6 NYCRR 617.2 [gg]; 617.3 [k] [1]).  In addition, respondent's SEQRA review failed to account for the acute environmental impacts associated with the relocation and reconstruction of petitioners' oil storage tanks and pipelines </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;6 NYCRR 617.14 [c]).  Furthermore, respondent failed to consider all the environmental ramifications of the shopping center project and failed to analyze reasonable alternatives to the project (ECL 8-0109 [2] [d]; 6 NYCRR 617.14 [f] [5]), particularly petitioners' proposal to consolidate their facilities on a portion of the site. However, respondent's failure to address the economic impacts of the project on the over-all Syracuse economy did not violate SEQRA since those impacts involved purely competitive economic facts, not environmental ones, nor did respondent err in relying only on data it received from its own experts concerning the impact of traffic and air quality since all that is required is that respondent have considered the data it received and given a reasoned response.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mining company appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court (New York), which converted its N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding seeking to annul amendments to respondent town's zoning ordinance to an action for declaratory judgment and declared that the amendments had been validly and constitutionally enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mining company challenged a judgment declaring amendments to the town's zoning laws constitutionally enacted. The amendments would have repealed Town of Sardinia, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect;&sect; 6.02(A)(5), 7.07 and would have designated as a permissible use mining permitted by a valid permit issued by the Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to the Mined Land Reclamation Law and a special use permit issued by the town. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and held that the town engaged in impermissible exclusionary zoning. The court found that the town after its executive session at the public hearing on the proposed special use permit amendments, dramatically shifted its focus and, without further public debate or explanation, adopted the Prohibition of Mining Amendments, and thereby completely curtailed a potential source of livelihood for all mine owners. The court also found that there was no evidence that the town provided a comprehensive community plan or determined that the total ban on mining would serve regional needs and requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Notice of Proposed Amendments In a proceeding challenging the adoption of zoning amendments prohibiting mining in respondent Town and relegating currently operating mines to nonconforming uses, Supreme Court should have annulled the adopted amendments where the proposed amendments, which were the subject of public notice, were different from the amendments which were ultimately adopted, since interested parties, such as petitioner mine operator, had neither proper notice of the amendments nor an opportunity to debate them at a public hearing. Whereas the noticed amendments would have generally banned mining in the Town but for permissible uses in certain districts subject to special use permit requirements, the adopted amendments succinctly and completely banned mining throughout the Town.  Thus, it was manifestly unfair for the Town to ban all new mining when it had appeared that nonconforming uses could be maintained by special use permits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Notice of Proposed Amendments In a proceeding challenging the adoption of zoning amendments prohibiting mining in respondent Town and relegating currently operating mines to nonconforming uses, Supreme Court should have annulled the adopted amendments where the proposed amendments, which were the subject of public notice, were different from the amendments which were ultimately adopted, since the failure to refer a proposed amendment or new ordinance to the pertinent county or regional planning department is a jurisdictional defect, and there is no evidence that the county planning board was ever provided with a copy of the adopted amendments.  Because the adopted amendments are substantially different from the proposed amendments, the county board should have had the opportunity to report and make recommendations on the new amendments, and because respondent Town did not afford that opportunity to the planning board, which replied to the submission of the Town's proposed amendments by expressly making &quot;no recommendation&quot;, the adopted amendments should be nullified.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Notice of Proposed Amendments In a proceeding challenging the adoption of zoning amendments prohibiting mining in respondent Town and relegating currently operating mines to nonconforming uses, Supreme Court should have annulled the adopted amendments where the proposed amendments, which were the subject of public notice, were different from the amendments which were ultimately adopted, since there is no evidence that the Town Planning Board, which is required by the local Zoning Ordinance to review and report on proposed amendments, ever reviewed, much less reported on, the adopted amendments completely banning mining in the Town.  Given the quick turnabout by the Town Board after its executive session at the public hearing on the proposed amendments, the evidence is that the planning board neither reviewed nor reported on the amendments which were ultimately adopted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Open Meetings Law - Improper Use of Executive Session In a proceeding challenging the adoption of zoning amendments prohibiting mining in respondent Town and relegating currently operating mines to nonconforming uses, Supreme Court should have annulled the adopted amendments where the proposed amendments, which were the subject of public notice, were different from the amendments which were ultimately adopted.  Although the Town Board and certain Town officials went into executive session at the close of the public hearing on the proposed amendments, ostensibly to discuss their likely effect on existing litigation, the Board emerged some 30 minutes later and formally resolved, without any further public involvement, to accept a previously prepared environmental assessment form and a negative SEQRA declaration, as well as to adopt the prohibition of mining amendments, effectively permitting the public to know only the result, viz., that the prohibition of mining amendments would be adopted without further SEQRA review.  By depriving the public of the opportunity to debate that adoption, both the letter and the spirit of the Open Meetings Law were violated: the decisions apparently reached at the executive session affected the public and directly related to the possibility of a municipal matter becoming an official enactment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - SEQRA Challenge A corporation engaged in mining in respondent Town has standing to seek judicial review of the Town's SEQRA determination that a proposed zoning amendment, which would prohibit mining in respondent Town and relegate currently operating mines to nonconforming uses, would not have a significant impact on the environment.  Inasmuch as the adopted amendment bans mining throughout the Town, an activity petitioner has carried on for years, petitioner has demonstrated that the administrative action will in fact have a harmful effect on it; by virtue of its status as the owner of property affected by the amendment, petitioner has demonstrated that its interest is within the zone of interest to be protected by the statute, viz., the environment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Failure to Take Hard Look In a proceeding challenging the adoption of zoning amendments prohibiting mining in respondent Town and relegating currently operating mines to nonconforming uses, Supreme Court should have granted petitioner mine owner's SEQRA challenge and annulled the adopted amendments where the proposed amendments, which were the subject of public notice, were different from the amendments which were ultimately adopted.  The Town Board failed to identify the relevant areas of environmental concern, take a hard look at them, and make a reasoned elaboration of the basis for its determination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mines and Minerals - Mined Land Reclamation Law - Preemption of Local Zoning Ordinance A local Zoning Ordinance which prohibited mining everywhere in respondent Town and relegated currently operating mines to nonconforming uses of land violates the supersession provision of the Mined Land Reclamation Law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;ECL 23-2703 [2]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Comprehensive Plan In a proceeding challenging the adoption of zoning amendments prohibiting mining in respondent Town and relegating currently operating mines to nonconforming uses, Supreme Court should have annulled the adopted amendments where the proposed amendments, which were the subject of public notice, were different from the amendments which were ultimately adopted.  The record, which reveals that mining has been a long-standing use in the Town and that the Town's geologist found reason to be wary of mining beneath the Town's water table, does not support the leap of logic taken by the Town from allowing mining as a special permitted use in certain areas, the object of the noticed amendments, to completely disallowing mining throughout the Town.  Respondent Town did not clearly articulate its rationale for the total ban on mining; rather, it took action that was tantamount to not considering problems presented and uniform provisions to deal with them, which tend to promote the general community welfare.  Accordingly, petitioner mine owner has satisfied its burden of overcoming the strong presumption of validity attaching to the adopted ordinance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Exclusionary Zoning In a proceeding challenging the adoption of zoning amendments prohibiting mining in respondent Town and relegating currently operating mines to nonconforming uses, Supreme Court should have annulled the adopted amendments where the proposed amendments, which were the subject of public notice, were different from the amendments which were ultimately adopted.  It appears that the Town engaged in impermissible exclusionary zoning where the Town Board, after an executive session following a public hearing on the noticed amendments, dramatically shifted its focus and, without further public debate or explanation, adopted the ordinance in question, thereby completely curtailing a potential source of livelihood for all mine owners in the Town.  There is no evidence that the Town Board provided a comprehensive community plan or determined that the total ban on mining would serve regional needs and requirements.  </SPAN></P>

However, Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 514, 545(1)(b) provide that an unwed father may be held accountable for the birth expenses of the mother of his child, which was sufficient to render him a liable &quot;third party&quot; under Medicaid. In contrast, a married father who was not able to contribute at the time the assistance was furnished was not liable under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 101(1). To impose liability on a father who was no more financially able than the mother violated principles of gender neutrality. The court held that: (1) because the father was a qualified Medicaid recipient at the time of the birth, he was not liable for amounts advanced on his daughter's behalf; (2) it was a denial of equal protection of the laws to permit the state to obtain reimbursement from an unwed father when a similarly situated married father was not liable; and (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to order reimbursement by a father who was a Medicaid recipient when his child was born.</SPAN></P>

Since respondent's liability, as a responsible relative of his child, for birth expenses attributable to the child's medical needs arises from the creation of an implied contract at the time the assistance was furnished (Social Services Law &sect; 366 [3] [a]), reimbursement may only be obtained if respondent was actually able to pay the child's expenses at the time they were incurred.  In addition, although an unwed father's liability for the mother's birth-related medical expenses does not similarly arise from the creation of an implied contract at the time the assistance is furnished </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 514, 545 [1] [b]; 42 USC &sect; 1396a [a] [25] [B]), imposing such liability upon an unwed father who was a Medicaid recipient when his child was born would be unconstitutionally discriminatory. Since the mother's receipt of Medicaid benefits to cover the birth constitutes a per se inability to contribute to those expenses for reimbursement purposes, imposing liability upon a father who is no more financially able than the mother would violate principles of gender neutrality.  Furthermore, the imposition of liability upon respondent, who was living with the mother before and after the birth and was a contributing member of her household for Medicaid eligibility purposes during that time period, would result in an unacceptable differentiation among fathers, with respect to their liability for birth expenses, on the basis of marital status alone.  There is no rational basis for permitting the State to obtain reimbursement from an unwed father when a married father who is in all pertinent respects similarly situated would not be liable due to an inability to contribute to the birth expenses at the time the assistance was furnished.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to their divorce, the father and mother entered into a separation agreement which provided that the mother would have custody of the parties' minor children. The parties thereafter modified the agreement to reflect that the father would have custody and that the mother was not obligated to contribute to their support. However, the father ultimately petitioned the family court for an order compelling the mother to pay child support, which she did for two months prior to retaking custody of the children. The mother then brought the instant action against the father alleging that the commencement of the family court proceeding was a breach of the modified separation agreement. The father sought summary judgment on the ground that such a cause of action was impermissible as against public policy, but the trial court denied the motion, finding that there were questions of fact precluding such drastic relief. On appeal, the court reversed and granted the father's motion, holding that such an action violated New York's public policy and that the preclusion of such action was not unconstitutional under the impairment of contracts doctrine of U.S. Const., art I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

While the Child Support Standards Act (CSSA) requires that due consideration be given to the terms of a relevant separation agreement (Family Ct Act &sect; 413 [1]&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">[l]),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a court is not bound by the terms of a separation agreement in arriving at the relevant support level.  Moreover, an inadequate child support provision contained in a separation agreement is voidable and cannot bind the court from remedying the inadequacy. Nor can it bind a parent from seeking to remedy the inadequacy. Furthermore, it is not unconstitutional under the impairment of contracts doctrine (US Const, art I, &sect; 10) to preclude a breach of contract action in this case.  A statute that is intended to prevent an economic wrong against the children is not unconstitutional as impairing contract rights. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner challenged a judgment of the Supreme Court, Warren County (New York), which dismissed his petition brought in a combined proceeding pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board assessed sewer rents on the investor's property pursuant to the Sewer Use Ordinance (ordinance). The lower court denied the investor's petition for relief. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the investor's petition, holding that there was a rational relationship between the sewer rents imposed and the amount of use, and that only a rational basis rather than a mathematical certainty was required to establish constitutionality. Therefore, the court held that underassessments and overassessments did not undermine the constitutionality of the ordinance so long as they were rationally based. Further, the proper standard of review of the rent assessments on the investor's property was whether they were unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious or an abuse of discretion. Because the investor had not challenged the accuracy of the assessments based upon the ordinance, and because the ordinance was constitutional, the assessments were rational and valid. Finally, the court modified the judgment to include a declaration of the ordinance's validity and that it was not violative of the Municipal Home Rule Law or state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Where, as here, an administrative action is alleged to be unconstitutional, a declaratory judgment action is the appropriate vehicle for challenge.  Since the constitutionality of the Ordinance is appropriately raised in such context, compliance with CPLR 7804 (e) is not required.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Water and Sewer Rates - Constitutionality of Sewer Use Ordinance Respondent Town Board's Sewer Use Ordinance (Ordinance), which imposes sewer rents for all property within the sewer district based upon &quot;user units&quot;, defined as the flow from a typical residence of 2.3 persons, is a valid and constitutional exercise of the Board's power.  The sewer rents, which are based upon a consideration of the statutory factors listed in General Municipal Law &sect; 451 (1), bear a rational relationship to the services and benefits rendered to property owners.  Petitioner's contention that the Ordinance is irrational due to the underassessment of other properties based on the amount of water consumed lacks merit since the law only requires a rational basis for these classifications, rather than a mathematical exactitude. Lastly, since petitioner does not argue that the Board's assessment of 9.5 &quot;user units&quot; for his mixed commercial and residential property is inaccurate based upon the Ordinance and since such Ordinance survives constitutional challenge, any assessment based thereon must be found to be rational (CPLR 7803 [3]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State enacted N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 341, which changed the manner in which motor vehicle damage insurance awards were paid. Insurers challenged the constitutionality of the statute, contending that it resulted in double taxation of insurance claimants. The trial court granted the insurers' motion for a preliminary injunction staying implementation of the statute. The trial court also denied the State's motion for summary judgment seeking a declaration that the statute was constitutional, and the State appealed the orders. The court concluded that the insurers failed to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality that attached to the statute. Accordingly, the court granted the State's cross motion for summary judgment and declared the statute constitutional. Although the court questioned the wisdom of the statute and noted the potential for misuse of the refund provisions, the court held that it was not free to invalidate a statute because it disagreed with its wisdom.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Prepayment of Sales Tax In an action by plaintiff insurance carriers challenging the constitutionality of Tax Law &sect; 341, which requires an insurance carrier that issues an award for damage to or theft of a motor vehicle to calculate the &quot;tax component&quot; of the award and to remit that amount directly to the State, with the insurance claimant being issued a credit voucher from the carrier which may then be used in lieu of paying sales tax if the vehicle is repaired or replaced within a year, the State waived the argument that plaintiffs lack standing to raise contentions on behalf of claimants who are not parties to the action by failing to raise it in its answer or in a preanswer motion to dismiss.  In any event, plaintiffs, as collectors of the tax and as the parties allegedly faced with overpayments, have a sufficient cognizable stake in the outcome of the action to contest the constitutionality of the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Sales and Use Taxes - Prepayment of Sales Tax on Motor Vehicle Damage Awards Supreme Court erred in granting plaintiff insurance carriers a preliminary injunction staying implementation of Tax Law &sect; 341, which requires an insurance carrier that issues an award for damage to or theft of a motor vehicle to calculate the &quot;tax component&quot; of the award based upon the higher of the sales tax in the locale where the claimant resides or where the vehicle is to be repaired and to remit that amount directly to the State, with the insurance claimant being issued a credit voucher from the carrier which may then be used in lieu of paying sales tax if the vehicle is repaired or replaced within a year, based on a determination that the statute's provisions violate due process by potentially subjecting claimants to the double payment of sales tax on the same transaction or requiring carriers, on occasion, to overpay the sales tax without the possibility of a refund. Although the statute imposes a tax on the &quot;transfer&quot; of the damage award to or on behalf of claimant, the statute actually provides for the prepayment of the sales tax and does not impose a new transfer tax separate from the sales tax paid when the vehicle is repaired or replaced. Consequently, the statute, on its face and in its intended operation, does not result in double taxation of insurance claimants. Speculation that claimants will be unable to find vendors to accept the vouchers does not demonstrate the statute's unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.  Since the choice of the vendor is in the control of the claimants and their carriers, any disadvantage caused by a vendor's failure to accept the voucher would be self-imposed and therefore should not render the statute constitutionally invalid.  Similarly, it is not arbitrary or unreasonable to base the tax rate on the taxing jurisdiction where the claimant resides or where the vehicle is repaired, depending on which is higher.  Furthermore, even if a claimant was forced to pay the sales tax twice because no vendor could be found to accept the voucher, the statute should not be interpreted as precluding, on its face, application of the tax refund provision in Tax Law &sect; 1139 (a).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Sales and Use Taxes - Prepayment of Sales Tax on Motor Vehicle Damage Awards - Due Process Tax Law &sect; 341, which requires an insurance carrier that issues an award for damage to or theft of a motor vehicle to calculate the &quot;tax component&quot; of the award based upon the higher of the sales tax in the locale where the claimant resides or where the vehicle is to be repaired and to remit that amount directly to the State, with the insurance claimant being issued a credit voucher from the carrier which may then be used in lieu of paying sales tax if the vehicle is repaired or replaced within a year, does not violate due process by depriving plaintiff insurance carriers of property without just compensation.  The fact that the over-all cost to plaintiffs of complying with the statute's voucher and record-keeping requirements might outweigh the taxes collected does not represent an unconstitutional taking of private property for a public benefit since there is no due process violation where, as here, a taxing statute is enacted to raise revenue and not for any other purpose.  Moreover, plaintiffs' due process argument is not persuasive in view of the fact that other businesses, no matter how small, are required to collect sales taxes and to maintain relevant records.  </SPAN></P>

In general, legislation will not be stricken as unconstitutional, even though it may interfere with existing contracts, if the legislation is addressed to a legitimate end and the measures taken are reasonable and appropriate to that end.  The means here used of requiring that the sales tax be remitted by the carrier at the time the damage award is transferred, rather than when the repair is made, is rationally related to the legitimate State purpose of ensuring that the sales tax is efficiently collected on the repair and replacement of motor vehicles.  In any event, plaintiffs' claim of harm in this regard is both premature and speculative.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Rule Making - Explanatory Statements and Technical Instructions Exempt from Rule-Making Procedures Credit voucher specifications issued by the State Tax Department in implementing Tax Law &sect; 341, which requires an insurance carrier that issues an award for damage to or theft of a motor vehicle to calculate the &quot;tax component&quot; of the award based upon the higher of the sales tax in the locale where the claimant resides or where the vehicle is to be repaired and to remit that amount directly to the State, with the insurance claimant being issued a credit voucher from the carrier which may then be used in lieu of paying sales tax if the vehicle is repaired or replaced within a year, are merely explanatory statements and technical instructions for meeting statutory requirements and, standing alone, are without legal effect and are thus exempt from rule-making procedures and filing requirements (State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 102 [2] [b] [iv]).  The statements in the specifications regarding penalties are merely explanatory as the statute provides for the imposition of civil penalties for the failure to furnish a properly completed voucher and stub.  Furthermore, rather than prescribing fixed, general principles to be applied by an administrative agency without regard to other facts and circumstances, the specifications indicate that the agency will be flexible in the manner in which the voucher and stub are produced.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Sales and Use Taxes - Prepayment of Sales Tax on Motor Vehicle Damage Awards Tax Law &sect; 341, which requires an insurance carrier that issues an award for damage to or theft of a motor vehicle to calculate the &quot;tax component&quot; of the award based upon the higher of the sales tax in the locale where the claimant resides or where the vehicle is to be repaired and to remit that amount directly to the State, with the insurance claimant being issued a credit voucher from the carrier which may then be used in lieu of paying sales tax if the vehicle is repaired or replaced within a year, is constitutional.  Plaintiff insurance carriers have failed to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality that attaches to the taxing statute.  Although Supreme Court, in granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction staying enforcement or implementation of the statute, questioned the wisdom of the statute and noted the potential for misuse of the refund provisions, courts are not free to invalidate a statute because they disagree with its wisdom.  The Legislature's concern regarding sales tax evasion in the repair of motor vehicles justifies the statutory scheme.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that judicial review of the determinations of educational institutions as to the academic performance of their students was limited to the question of whether the challenged determination was arbitrary and capricious, irrational, made in bad faith, unconstitutional, or contrary to statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was a sperm donor to the mother and her domestic partner.

Whatever concerns and misgivings the family court and the mother had about visitation, custody, and the child's best interests, those issues were appropriately reserved for a later stage of the proceedings. Without the order of filiation to which the law entitled the father, he lacked standing to seek visitation, pursuant to &sect; 549 of the Act, or to challenge the mother's concept of what might or might not have been in the child's best interests, pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, organization and city, challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court in New York County that dismissed their claims that defendant state's allocation of funds perpetuated a disparity in the educational system for failure to state a cause of action under The Education Article, N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, or the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claims by plaintiffs, organization and city, that defendant state's allocation of funds perpetuated a disparity in the educational system were dismissed except to the extent that civil rights claims were asserted under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000. The court affirmed the dismissal, finding that plaintiffs did not state a cause of action under the Education Article, N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, or the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because the allegations that reduced resources resulted in their failure to meet minimum education standards were rejected in prior cases, and plaintiffs did not demonstrate that circumstances had changed to warrant new scrutiny. The court reversed with respect to the causes upheld by the lower court. It held that reliance on N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 291(2) was unavailing because the funding allocation scheme itself did not discriminate. Although the court recognized that 34 C.F.R. &sect; 100.3 allowed for a cause of action for disparate impact, it found that such impact did not result from the designation of a lump sum to city schools but rather from the suballocation of the funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing claims by plaintiffs, organization and city, that defendant state's allocation of funds perpetuated educational disparity was affirmed because plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action where they did not show changed circumstances to warrant review of prior decisions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of Public School Financing System Plaintiffs' challenge to the State's system of allocating funds to local school districts as being violative of the Education Article of the State Constitution (art XI, &sect; 1), based on conclusory allegations that the allocation scheme perpetuates a disparity in the State's educational system, resulting in the failure of certain New York City community school board districts to meet &quot;minimum standards of educational quality and quantity&quot;, must be dismissed as a matter of law for failure to state a cause of action since the theory expounded by plaintiffs herein is virtually identical to that advanced, fully tried and ultimately rejected on appeal in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Board of Educ. v Nyquist</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (57 NY2d 27, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">appeals dismissed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;459 US 1139), which held that the Education Article only requires the State to provide &quot;a sound basic education&quot; and that the State's school financing system, although &quot;resulting in significant unevenness in the educational opportunities offered&quot;, did not illegally discriminate against large city school districts.  Plaintiffs' equal protection claims must likewise be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action since plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate adequately that circumstances have changed or deteriorated in the 12 years since the prior Court of Appeals decision to warrant a new scrutiny of this claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of Public School Financing System - Civil Rights Violation Plaintiffs' challenge to the State's school financing system as constituting a civil rights violation under article I, &sect; 11 of the State Constitution by reason of discrimination against certain minority students in the affected New York City school district should have been dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. The IAS Court erroneously upheld this cause of action only by reference to Executive Law &sect; 291 (2), which guarantees equal opportunity to education as a civil right.  However, that statute merely assures every student an &quot;opportunity to obtain education&quot;.  There is nothing in the funding allocation scheme which discriminates against any of the individual plaintiffs and thus deprives them of such educational opportunity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Validity of Public School Financing System - Federal Civil Rights Violation Plaintiffs' challenge to the State's school financing system as being violative of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &sect; 2000d) and the implementing regulations promulgated thereunder (34 CFR 100.3 [b] [2]) should have been dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. The IAS Court erred in finding liability under the applicable regulation, which prohibits a recipient of Federal funds for education programs from utilizing &quot;methods of administration&quot; which result in unjustifiable disparate impact upon minorities, regardless of lack of intention to discriminate. However, the State's role in allocating education funds simply designates a lump sum to the New York City school system as a unitary school district. It is not that function which results in disparate impact on minority racial or ethnic groups; rather, it is the method by which plaintiff Chancellor of the City School District divides and suballocates those funds that may arguably result in the disparate impact complained of here.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Standing of Municipal Plaintiffs to Challenge State's Public School Financing System The challenge by the municipal plaintiffs to the State's school financing system on constitutional grounds was properly dismissed by the IAS Court for lack of legal capacity to sue.  Units of municipal government, as political subdivisions created by the State, generally lack the capacity to challenge in a lawsuit the constitutionality of State legislative enactments affecting them.  In addition, dismissal also rests on the ground of failure to state a cause of action, even in the absence of a cross appeal by defendants in the case brought by the municipal plaintiffs.  Consolidation of both cases challenging the funding allocation scheme for decision in the IAS Court and on appeal, and the fact that defendants have noticed a cross appeal in one of the cases, permit the Appellate Division to reach this expanded disposition.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged an order of the Supreme Court (New York), which, in a recommitment proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(14), denied the state's application seeking the recommitment of respondent, an acquittee by reason of mental disease or defect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court denied the state's petition to have respondent, an acquittee by reason of mental disease or defect, recommitted pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(14), and the state sought review. The court held that the supreme court erred in finding that respondent was not suffering from a dangerous mental disorder at the time of the hearing merely because respondent did not exhibit dangerous behavior under the structured environment of a psychiatric hospital as respondent had repeatedly violated the order of conditions upon which he gained release and was still mentally ill and a polysubstance abuser given to acts of violence. The court found that even if respondent should have been treated like a civil committee, the evidence at the hearing met the more stringent clear and convincing evidence test. The court held that the failure to serve respondent the recommitment application within the five-year period was not a jurisdictional defect. The court found that the affidavit submitted in support of the recommitment application was sufficient. The denial of the application for recommitment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order denying the state's application to have respondent, an acquittee by reason of mental disease or defect, recommitted, and granted the application to have respondent confined to a secure psychiatric institution, holding that there was ample evidence that respondent suffered from a dangerous mental disorder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Insanity - Recommitment Proceeding - Sufficiency of Evidence of Dangerous Mental Disorder Supreme Court, having found after a lengthy hearing on recommitment pursuant to CPL 330.20 (14) that respondent, an insanity acquittee with a long history of mental illness and drug abuse who has repeatedly violated the order of conditions upon which he gained release, is still mentally ill and a polysubstance abuser given to acts of violence, and having further found that it was &quot;highly likely&quot; that respondent, once released, would revert to his prior pattern of uncontrollable violent behavior and would not comply with any treatment plan but would relapse into drug and alcohol abuse, erred in finding that respondent was not, at the time of the hearing, suffering from a dangerous mental disorder within the meaning of CPL 330.20 (1) (c) merely because respondent did not exhibit dangerous behavior under the structured environment of a psychiatric hospital.  Compliance or lack of dangerousness in a facility does not necessarily mean that an individual does not suffer from a dangerous mental disorder. Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing that respondent will inevitably resort to assaultive or other dangerous behavior upon his release from a controlled environment, appellants have established by a fair preponderance of the evidence that respondent suffered from a dangerous mental disorder at the time of the hearing, and, accordingly, the petition for recommitment should have been granted.  Furthermore, the fact that respondent was originally found to be mentally ill but not suffering from a dangerous mental disorder, following his plea of not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect, does not preclude his recommitment pursuant to CPL 330.20 (14).  In any event, even if respondent should be treated like a civil committee, the evidence at the hearing met the more stringent clear and convincing evidence test.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Insanity - Recommitment Proceeding - Service of Notice of Recommitment Application Not Required within Period of Order of Conditions In a proceeding to recommit respondent, an insanity acquittee, pursuant to CPL 330.20 (14), the Commissioner's failure to serve respondent with written notice of the recommitment application within the five-year period of the order of conditions upon which respondent gained release does not constitute a jurisdictional defect requiring dismissal of the application where the application for recommitment was timely filed within the five-year period.  While the statute requires service of the application for recommitment on the defendant, it does not require that service on the defendant be made simultaneously and within the period of the underlying order of conditions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Insanity - Recommitment Proceeding - Sufficiency of Psychiatric Examiner's Affidavit in Support of Recommitment Application In a 1992 proceeding to recommit respondent, an insanity acquittee, pursuant to CPL 330.20 (14), the statutorily mandated psychiatric examiner's affidavit submitted in support of the recommitment application, indicating that, based upon the psychiatrist's clinical evaluation of respondent in 1990, a review of respondent's in-patient psychiatric care, respondent's history of noncompliance with his order of conditions and his two recent arrests, respondent constituted a danger to himself or others and required care and treatment in a secure psychiatric facility, is sufficient to satisfy the statute's requirements that the affidavit set forth the defendant's clinical diagnosis, a detailed analysis of the defendant's mental condition and the opinion of the psychiatric examiner, particularly since the Commissioner had lost contact with respondent upon respondent's release from a psychiatric facility in 1990 and was, thereby, unable to submit a more updated clinical analysis.  In any event, the alleged insufficiency of the allegations in the affidavit are not jurisdictional defects, but rather would be pertinent only to a motion to dismiss the proceeding or a habeas corpus petition prior to hearings.  The technical sufficiency of the affidavit, upon which the recommitment proceeding was commenced, should not be considered after extensive hearings established that respondent did suffer from a dangerous mental disorder. </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the property owners' complaint for failure to state a cause of action and failure to present support for the allegation that the user fees constituted a taking. The court held that the protection of Lake George's natural and environmental resources were of state concern; thus, enactment of the challenged statutes did not violate the home rule provisions of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(2); there was a rational basis for the fees; the fees were not a taking; and the navigational servitude over the property owners' submerged private lands was not a taking because it was not statutory but was always there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Matters Abandoned - Raising Issue for First Time on Appeal In a combined CPLR article 78 proceeding and action for declaratory judgment challenging the validity of certain laws (L 1979, ch 599; L 1987, ch 617, amending ECL 17-1709 [3]) and regulations (6 NYCRR parts 645, 646) promulgated to implement the regulatory authority of respondent Lake George Park Commission over, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vessels, wharfs, moorings and fee schedules (ECL 43-0125), any claims relating to the propriety of Supreme Court's decision to deny the relief requested by petitioners in an order to show cause are deemed abandoned due to petitioners' failure to have presented any arguments with respect thereto.  Furthermore, to the extent that petitioners now contend that the challenged laws should be annulled because they violate or are in conflict with the Public Lands Law, the Navigation Law and the Public Health Law, these arguments were not raised before Supreme Court and should therefore not be considered on appeal by the Appellate Division.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Home Rule Powers of Local Governments - Lake George Park Commission In a combined CPLR article 78 proceeding and action for declaratory judgment challenging the validity of certain laws (L 1979, ch 599; L 1987, ch 617, amending ECL 17-1709 [3]) and regulations (6 NYCRR parts 645, 646) promulgated to implement the regulatory authority of respondent Lake George Park Commission over, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vessels, wharfs, moorings and fee schedules (ECL 43-0125), Supreme Court correctly rejected petitioners' contention that the challenged laws were enacted in violation of their right to self-government under the home rule provisions of the State Constitution (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]) and that respondent Town failed to protect those rights on their behalf.  The record demonstrates that the protection of the lake's water quality and environs is of sufficient importance to the State generally to sustain the enactment of the statutes.  The protection of the lake as an environmental resource of the State is also of State concern rather than a matter of local concern only.  Thus, the constitutional home rule provisions have not been violated by the enactment of these statutes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Rational Basis Standard - User Fees for Commercial Docks Petitioners, who own and operate a lodge on Lake George with dock and other related facilities, have failed to demonstrate that the schedule of user fees for commercial docks imposed by ECL 43-0125 (2) (a) as enacted by Laws of 1987 (ch 617) violates their right to equal protection because the fees apply only to those engaged in recreational boating and not to other classes of users such as homeowners and visitors to the lake. Since the subject classification is not a burden on fundamental constitutional rights nor does it create a suspect class, the rational basis test is the applicable standard of review and, under such standard, there is a rational basis to charge higher fees on the owners of commercial docks than on owners of residential docks since commercial facilities allow a greater number of boats to use the lake than do residential facilities and they require additional facilities and parking space to accommodate those users, thereby increasing the costs of regulation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - User Fees for Commercial Docks Petitioners, who own and operate a lodge on Lake George with dock and other related facilities, have failed to demonstrate that the schedule of user fees for commercial docks imposed by ECL 43-0125 (2) (a) as enacted by Laws of 1987 (ch 617) effects an unconstitutional taking of private property without due process.  The fees imposed are not a lien or a tax since they are not imposed to generate revenue or to offset the costs of governmental functions generally, but, rather, are user fees imposed to reimburse the costs of government services.  Furthermore, any diminution in value caused by the fees does unlawfully not burden petitioners with a &quot;navigational servitude&quot; over their submerged private lands on which their docks are located since the &quot;navigational servitude&quot; was always there and did not result from the challenged statute.  The &quot;navigational servitude&quot; does not arise because of the public ownership of lands under water but because of the common-law principle that the navigable waters of the State are held in trust by the State for the benefit of the people of the State without regard as to who owns the banks and beds of the waterway.  Thus, although land under a navigable waterway may be privately owned, it is still subject to regulation by the State.  Lastly, petitioners, as the owners of a &quot;regulated facility&quot; which leases berths to their guests, do use the &quot;unique resources of the Lake George park&quot;.  Under these circumstances, the user fees do not authorize a taking without just compensation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent promulgated regulations to implement 1992 N.Y. Laws ch. 501. The insurance company petitioned under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 to invalidate the regulations. The supreme court dismissed the challenge to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, part 361, but granted the petition and invalidated N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 360.4(c), 360.3(a)(1)(ii).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceeding against Body or Officer - When Remedy Appropriate - Challenge to Insurance Department Regulations Converted to Declaratory Judgment Action A CPLR article 78 proceeding to annul certain Insurance Department regulations (11 NYCRR part 361) implementing the statutory directive that commercial health insurers doing business in New York employ community rating and offer open enrollment for any insurance market in which they participate (L 1992, ch 501) should have been commenced as a declaratory judgment action and the proceeding will therefore be so converted pursuant to CPLR 103 (c).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance - Health and Accident Insurance - Individual and Small Group Health Insurance - Validity of Mandatory Pool Contributions by Insurers Having Lower Share of High-Risk Insureds An Insurance Department regulation, which establishes a pooling system requiring commercial health insurers having a lower share of high-risk insureds, such as petitioner, to contribute to the pool in amounts necessary to permit sharing or equalization of the risk of high-cost claims (11 NYCRR part 361), is in accord with the mandate of the enabling statute (L 1992, ch 501) that the Superintendent promulgate regulations to assure the orderly implementation of the legislative directive that commercial health insurers doing business in New York employ community rating and offer open enrollment for any insurance market in which they participate (Insurance Law &sect; 3233 [a]).  Considering the enabling statute as a whole and in view of its objective to spread the risk among more people and stabilize health insurance premiums, Supreme Court correctly determined that the Legislature intended to create a mandatory pooling system.  Furthermore, Supreme Court correctly rejected the contention that the Legislature intended pool contributions to be based on policies written after the statute's effective date and not to existing policies.  Since the regulation requires calculations of relative risk to be made based upon all policyholders and not just those of new policyholders, the regulation is in accordance with the legislative directive. In addition, the mandatory pool contributions are a valid exercise of the Legislature's power to regulate and do not constitute an unconstitutional tax.  Nor do such contributions constitute a gift of State money to a private organization in violation of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8 (1) or an unconstitutional regulatory taking without just compensation.  Petitioner cannot support its contention that it has a constitutionally protected interest in maintaining a healthier than average risk pool. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance - Health and Accident Insurance - Individual and Small Group Health Insurance - Validity of Regulation Requiring Insurers of &quot;Small Groups&quot; to Extend Health Coverage to Individual Proprietors and Groups of Two An Insurance Department regulation which, pursuant to the mandate of the enabling statute (L 1992, ch 501) that commercial health insurers doing business in New York employ community rating and offer open enrollment for any insurance market in which they participate, requires insurers of &quot;small groups&quot; to also extend coverage to individual proprietors and groups of two (11 NYCRR 360.4 [c]), is contrary to the unambiguous statutory directive defining &quot;small group&quot; as groups of 3 to 50 (Insurance Law &sect; 3231 [a]) and is thus invalid for exceeding the scope of the delegated authority.  Insurance Law &sect; 3231 (b), which provides that &quot;[i]ndividual proprietors and groups of two must be classified in the individual or small group rating category by the insurer&quot;, applies only to the rating of policies and does not provide authority for requiring insurers of &quot;small groups&quot; to extend coverage to individual proprietors and groups of two.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance - Health and Accident Insurance - Individual and Small Group Health Insurance - Validity of Regulation Changing Minimum Participation Levels among Employees in Order to Qualify for Small Group Health Coverage An Insurance Department regulation which, pursuant to the mandate of the enabling statute (L 1992, ch 501) that commercial health insurers doing business in New York employ community rating and offer open enrollment for any insurance market in which they participate, requires the insurer, for purposes of determining minimum participation levels among employees in order to qualify for small group coverage, to &quot;include as participating all eligible employees or members of the group covered under all the alternative health maintenance organization plans made available by the group&quot; (11 NYCRR 360.3 [a] [1] [ii]), is null and void as exceeding the scope of the delegated authority.  The enabling statute did not amend or change the minimum participation requirements set forth in Insurance Law &sect; 4235 (c) (1), which provides that the insurer does not have to offer coverage to a group if less than 50% of the employees in the group do not agree to participate in a plan, and the Superintendent therefore exceeded his authority by redefining the calculation of participation levels.  </SPAN></P>

The failure of the Legislature to pass legislation similar to the Executive Order does not provide indirect proof of a policy decision against the establishment of a CUB as an instrument of public policy. However, the Governor, by issuing the Executive Order, nonetheless impermissibly exceeded existing legislative policy, which charges the PSC, the Consumer Protection Board and the Attorney-General to protect consumers in utility proceedings.  Although Public Service Law &sect; 30 establishes a general policy favoring utility customers as to, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;lengthy delays&quot; of service, it does not contemplate the remedial device of certification of a CUB to have access to State mailings. Furthermore, Executive Law article 20, which authorizes the creation of and sets forth the powers and duties of the Consumer Protection Board, does not provide the requisite authority for the certification of a single CUB.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concerned about the need for an adjustment to the telephone corporation's rates to reflect the uncompensated use of certain intangible utility assets by its unregulated affiliates and to offset certain costs imposed on it by its affiliates that could not be readily or directly quantified, the commission ordered a separate proceeding to consider the propriety and need for such an adjustment. After administrative hearings, the commission issued an order that concluded that it had legal authority to make the adjustment and, imputed to the telephone corporation, a royalty payment of two percent of the total capitalization of its unregulated operations, regardless of when its investment occurred. The court confirmed the determinations, holding that the commission had the authority to establish the adjustment because it was required to ensure that rates charged by the telephone corporation and other utilities were &quot;just and reasonable,&quot; pursuant to N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Authority of Public Service Commission to Impute 2% Royalty Payment to Utility with Respect to Utility's Investment in Unregulated Operations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) had the authority for rate-making purposes to impute revenues to petitioner telephone company in the form of a royalty in an amount equal to 2% of petitioner's capitalization in unregulated operations as an adjustment to petitioner's rates to reflect the uncompensated use of certain intangible assets by petitioner's unregulated affiliates, such as petitioner's name and reputation, and to offset certain costs imposed on petitioner by its affiliates that could not be readily or directly quantified by conventional rate making.  The PSC's broad authority to determine &quot;just and reasonable&quot; utility rates (Public Service Law &sect; 91 [1]) includes not only the right but the duty to scrutinize transactions between a utility and its affiliates, and to make rate adjustments when the utility is being overcharged by affiliated suppliers. Furthermore, the fact that the PSC had previously approved petitioner's diversification and investment in its affiliates does not preclude the PSC from establishing the 2% royalty. In addition, the PSC's action was not preempted by the Public Utility Holding Company Act (15 USC &sect; 79 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in view of Congress' expressed intent to preserve and continue State regulation of utilities.  Lastly, the PSC did not exceed its authority by imputing the 2% royalty to petitioner since the effect of the PSC's imputation of income did not compel petitioner to expand its services outside its territory.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Validity of Public Service Commission's Imputation of 2% Royalty Payment with Respect to Utility's Investment in Unregulated Operations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The determinations of respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) which imputed revenues to petitioner telephone company in the form of a royalty in an amount equal to 2% of petitioner's capitalization in unregulated operations as an adjustment to petitioner's rates to reflect the uncompensated use of certain intangible assets by petitioner's unregulated affiliates, and to offset certain costs imposed on petitioner by its affiliates that could not be readily or directly quantified by conventional rate making, have a rational basis and will therefore be sustained.  The PSC rationally concluded that certain intangible assets, such as a utility's name and reputation, have value and that the utility's ratepayers, who have a legitimate concern about the disposition of utility assets, are entitled to some adjustment in their rates to recognize the utility's free transfer of such intangible assets to its unregulated affiliates. Petitioner allowed its affiliates to use its name without compensation and the PSC was therefore justified in acting to protect the ratepayers from imprudent utility conduct.  Furthermore, there is evidence in the record to support the PSC's conclusion that despite the existence of cost allocation procedures, petitioner's association with its affiliates results in increased costs that cannot be precisely and accurately quantified by conventional rate making, including employee transfers, letters of credit, affiliate overcharges, cost accounting abuses and accounting inexactitudes.  The PSC rationally concluded that petitioner, like any other regulated utility, has abundant incentive to shift costs from its competitive to its monopoly operations and it was therefore justified in acting to protect ratepayers from the increased costs.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The determinations of respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) which imputed revenues to petitioner telephone company in the form of a royalty in an amount equal to 2% of petitioner's capitalization in unregulated operations as an adjustment to petitioner's rates to reflect the uncompensated use of certain intangible assets by petitioner's unregulated affiliates (regulated value assurance mechanism), and to offset certain costs imposed on petitioner by its affiliates that could not be readily or directly quantified by conventional rate making (positive benefits mechanism), have a rational basis and will therefore be sustained.  The PSC, in using the 2% royalty as a means of accomplishing the adjustment intended by the regulated value assurance mechanism and the positive benefits mechanism, exercised its judgment in a technical area of public utility regulation that lies within its special competence and expertise.  In addition, the PSC's use of a similar 2% royalty as a rebuttable presumption in future rate cases with respect to any utility's investment in unregulated operations is not irrational. The purpose of the presumption is not to mandate the imposition of a royalty in all future rate cases or to modify the manner in which evidence will be weighed, but to put utilities and other parties on notice that the royalty issue must be addressed.  Furthermore, the arguments raised by several utilities concerning subsequent PSC orders relating to the applicability of the rebuttable presumption to holding companies, &quot;upstream&quot; affiliates and certain subsidiaries are not properly raised in this proceeding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Constitutionality of Public Service Commission's Imputation of 2% Royalty Payment with Respect to Utility's Investment in Unregulated Operations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The determinations of respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) which imputed revenues to petitioner telephone company in the form of a royalty in an amount equal to 2% of petitioner's capitalization in unregulated operations as an adjustment to petitioner's rates to reflect the uncompensated use of certain intangible assets by petitioner's unregulated affiliates, and to offset certain costs imposed on petitioner by its affiliates that could not be readily or directly quantified by conventional rate making, have a rational basis and will not be invalidated on constitutional grounds.  The economic impact of the PSC's action and its effect on investor expectations are negligible, and there has been no permanent appropriation of utility property.  The alleged effect of the royalty imputation on interstate commerce is indirect and speculative, and in view of the legitimate local concern addressed by the royalty, there is no violation of the Commerce Clause.  There is no equal protection or due process violation since the PSC's action does not involve a fundamental right and is rationally related to a legitimate State interest.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company, which issued Medicare supplemental insurance policies, sought a declaratory judgment that N.Y.

Under the regulations, all individual and small group health insurance policies, including Medicare supplemental policies, had to be community rated. The regulations were promulgated in order to give insurers a choice: an insurer could cease issuing the insurance before February 1, 1993, and a community rating would not apply to its existing guaranteed renewable policies, or it could continue to issue such coverage on or after February 1, 1993, in which case community rating would apply to the previously issued policies. The insurance company argued that the regulations impermissibly impaired existing contract rights and violated equal protection and due process. The lower court ruled for the insurance superintendent, and the insurance company appealed. The court affirmed the lower court.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulations promulgated by defendant Superintendent of Insurance, which, in implementing the open enrollment and community rating law (L 1992, ch 501), give an insurer issuing Medicare supplemental insurance policies in New York the choice to either stop issuing such policies in New York before February 1, 1993, in which case community rating would not apply to its guaranteed renewable policies (11 NYCRR 360.4 [e]), or to continue issuing such coverage after that date, in which case community rating would apply to the previously issued policies (11 NYCRR 360.11 [a] [1] [iii]), do not impermissibly impair existing contract rights and are not otherwise unconstitutional.  In order to survive the constitutional challenge, a choice must exist, and, under the circumstances present here, the regulations provide plaintiff with a very real choice.  The regulations do not require plaintiff to offer coverage or to insure against risks different from the coverage offered or risks insured against in the Medicare supplemental policies it previously issued.  The terms of plaintiff's guaranteed renewable policies do not prohibit a change in premium at the time of renewal. Rather, the policies make express provision for a change in renewal premiums in accordance with plaintiff's table of premium rates applicable to all policies of the same form and class.  Community rating has merely expanded the &quot;class&quot; to &quot;the entire pool of risks covered by [the] policy or contract form without regard to age, sex, health status or occupation&quot; (Insurance Law &sect; 3231 [a]).  </SPAN></P>

The language of the statute that &quot;[n]othing in this section shall be construed to authorize payment in advance of rendering service to the school district&quot; clearly prohibits payment of teachers' salaries in advance of services.  As such, petitioner's past payment policy is contrary to the public policy proclaimed in the statute.  While the preferred means of resolving a contractual dispute is to allow arbitration and afford an arbitrator an opportunity to fashion a remedy that does not violate public policy, here, the only relief the arbitrator could fashion under respondent's demand would be violative of public policy.

Supreme Court did not err in ruling that petitioner's past policy was not violative of NY Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 1, since the past payment policy was not a loan to teachers, which would be prohibited, but was a prepayment for services promised to be rendered and the failure to perform the contracted services would constitute a breach of contract. </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment but not its reasoning. Although the employee was not required to serve a notice of claim, she was unable to maintain a wrongful termination causes of action because her position was unclassified. Thus, she was effectively an at-will employee. In addition, the employee was unable to maintain her third cause of action because she did not name the attorney general, who was a necessary party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town appealed a decision of the Supreme Court of Orange County (New York), which ordered the town to refund fees it had imposed on plaintiff local taxpayers for water and sewer tap-in fees. The town argued that it had the power to impose the fees. It also argued that a taxpayer who had not paid under protest was not entitled to a refund, even if the fees were improperly assessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A town imposed fees on local businesses whenever they &quot;tapped in&quot; to existing water and sewer lines. Under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 198(1)(h), a town's authority to impose a sewer connection fee was limited to the construction expense of providing service, a fee for inspecting the connection, and the expenses of performing any service or providing any special benefit to the user. Under N.Y. Town Law &sect; 198(3)(a), a town's authority to impose tap-in fees on its water facilities was limited to the costs of installation of the supply pipe. Eight taxpayers paid the fees under protest and then filed an action against the town. The trial court declared the resolutions under which the fees were charged to be void and ordered the fees to be refunded. The town appealed. The court, citing the applicable statutes, affirmed. Although one of the taxpayers had not paid its fees under protest, the court nonetheless found that it was entitled to relief. The taxpayer filed its action promptly. Not only were the fees paid under duress where the town threatened to deny the taxpayer's building permit if it withheld funds, but it would unjustly enrich the town to allow it to keep the fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayers filed an action against respondent school district seeking a declaration that the school district's custodial agreement constituted a gift of public money to a private organization was unconstitutional and violated the competitive bidding requirements contained in N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 103. The Supreme Court, Schoharie County (New York) granted taxpayer's motion for summary judgment in part. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's suit was based on the school district service contract with a custodial management company. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly determined that the taxpayers did no have standing under the state finance law because the taxpayers failed to clearly trace the moneys expanded or to be expended by the school district, pursuant to the custodial contract, to identifiable state funds. Additionally, the court held that the trial court's recognition of a constitutional right of standing was improper because their constitutional claim that the agreement constituted a gift or loan of public funds in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, did not create a constitutional right of standing. However, the court held that the taxpayers residing in the district did have standing under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51. The court, also, held that the trial court correctly determined that the taxpayers' constitutional and statutory claims were not time barred, as their proceeding was commenced well within the applicable four-month statute of limitations, N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217. Lastly, the court held that taxpayers did raise a valid due process claim.</SPAN></P>

Since this is a case involving a claimed unauthorized expenditure of State funds, the parties must follow the statutory procedures.  The fact that petitioners also assert a constitutional claim that the agreement constitutes a gift or loan of public funds to a private organization in violation of NY Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 1 does not create a constitutional right of standing.  </SPAN></P>

The Town Code of Babylon &sect; 213-378, which provided that adult uses as defined in Town Code of Babylon &sect; 213-377 should not be located within a 500 foot radius of any area zoned for residential use, was a permissible restriction.

The interpretation of a zoning ordinance by a local board was entitled to deference, so long as it was not irrational, unreasonable or inconsistent with the governing statute. The clear purpose of the ordinance at issue was to eliminate the secondary effects of adult uses as well as to attempt to control the future development in business districts, and not to regulate expression.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court (New York), which denied her motion for summary judgment and which declared City of New York, N.Y., Administrative Code &sect; 26-408 (b)(1), and N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord purchased rent-controlled buildings which housed tenants who had resided there for decades. Later, the rent-control laws were amended and she was unable to evict her tenants on owner-occupancy grounds. She commenced an action against defendants, city and the commissioner of housing, challenging the 20-year residency bar to eviction as a physical as well as regulatory taking and a due process violation under both the federal and state constitutions. The supreme court declared the relevant statute constitutional and the decision was affirmed on appeal. The court held that the landlord failed to show that the amended rent-control laws created perpetual tenancies because a number of events would allow her to recover the apartments, and thus there was no physical taking. Further, she failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the regulation and failed to prove every element of the claim beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no regulatory taking because she failed to demonstrate an immediate and compelling necessity for her use. The court concluded that the residency status protected by the challenged regulation advanced a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Physical Taking - Rent-Control Provision Prohibiting Eviction of 20-Year Tenants New York City's owner-occupancy eviction provisions, which, effective June 19, 1984, prohibit a landlord's recovery of a rent-controlled housing accommodation for his or her family's use where a member of the household lawfully occupying the accommodation has been a tenant in the building for 20 years or more (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-408 [b] [1]; Rent and Eviction Regulations [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2204.5 [a]), do not effect an unconstitutional physical taking of property without just compensation.  Government has considerable latitude in regulating landlord-tenant relationships to preclude eviction in hardship, emergency and rent-control cases.  Plaintiffs, who purchased their rent-controlled building in 1983, have failed to make a showing that the enumerated contingencies which still permit a landlord to recover a 20-year tenant's housing accommodation cannot occur and thus are unable to show that the 20-year residency bar to eviction has created perpetual tenancies so as to constitute a physical taking. Furthermore, the fact that a rent-regulated tenancy might itself be of indefinite duration does not, without more, render it a permanent physical occupation of property.  Moreover, while housing regulations that force owners, in the first instance, to put their properties to use for residential housing could constitute a physical taking, restrictions imposed on existing tenancies to protect the current tenant, as here, are generally permissible.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Regulatory Taking - Rent-Control Provision Prohibiting Eviction of 20-Year Tenants New York City's owner-occupancy eviction provisions, which, effective June 19, 1984, prohibit a landlord's recovery of a rent-controlled housing accommodation for his or her family's use where a member of the household lawfully occupying the accommodation has been a tenant in the building for 20 years or more (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-408 [b] [1]; Rent and Eviction Regulations [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2204.5 [a]), do not effect an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property without just compensation by denying plaintiffs the economically viable use of their property.  The challenged housing regulations have not substantially frustrated plaintiffs' reasonable investment-backed expectation of being able to evict their tenants. Plaintiffs purchased the premises in 1983 knowing that it was subject to rent control and any expectancy they might realistically have had as to the recapture of the apartments in question for their own personal use was always a speculative one, being contingent on their ability to demonstrate an immediate and compelling necessity for such use.  Furthermore, an assessment of the economic impact of the regulations on plaintiffs' property cannot be made in the absence of some factual showing as to the rental income and purchase price of the building.  Lastly, the nature of the regulation is not of the type to constitute a regulatory taking. The regulations at issue do not create perpetual tenancies but, rather, allow for termination of the tenancies affected by the occurrence of normal events.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Regulatory Taking - Rent-Control Provision Prohibiting Eviction of 20-Year Tenants New York City's owner-occupancy eviction provisions, which, effective June 19, 1984, prohibit a landlord's recovery of a rent-controlled housing accommodation for his or her family's use where a member of the household lawfully occupying the accommodation has been a tenant in the building for 20 years or more (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-408 [b] [1]; Rent and Eviction Regulations [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2204.5 [a]), do not effect an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property without just compensation.  The challenged regulations substantially advance the legitimate State interest of protecting long-term tenants of rent-controlled apartments from eviction and preventing homelessness.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Involuntary Servitude - Due Process In an action challenging the constitutionality of New York City's owner-occupancy eviction provisions, which prohibit a landlord's recovery of a rent-controlled housing accommodation for his or her own use where a member of the household lawfully occupying the accommodation has been a tenant in the building for 20 years or more (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-408 [b] [1]; Rent and Eviction Regulations [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2204.5 [a]), plaintiffs' claim that the 20-year residency bar to eviction subjects them to involuntary servitude is frivolous since the challenged provisions do not compel them to remain landlords against their will.  Plaintiffs need only sell their building to escape the minimal restrictions placed on them by the challenged provisions.  Plaintiffs' due process claims are equally frivolous since rent-control provisions such as those at issue are well within the government's police powers.  They bear a reasonable relationship to the valid public purpose of preserving affordable housing and preventing the dislocation of lower income and moderate income tenants. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital was a participant in the Medicaid program. The DOH amended N.Y. Comp.

In calculating the hospital's Medicaid reimbursement rates, the DOH offset the hospital's interest expense by the amount of investment income earned on funds that the hospital had designated as funded depreciation accounts. The DOH reasoned that the accounts were unrestricted board-designated funds, whose investment income offset the hospital's interest expense. The hospital challenged the Commissioner's determinations and the validity of the amendment to &sect; 86-1.23(b). The trial court remitted the proceeding to the DOH to determine whether the funds were properly established and whether the income from the funds was used to fund depreciation. On appeal, the court modified the order and as modified, affirmed. The DOH had to determine whether the corpora of the funds were restricted and used for accumulated depreciation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner of apartment buildings (owner) appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Oneida County (New York), which denied his motion for summary judgment and granted defendant village's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint in the owner's action challenging the village's enactment of a law establishing a &quot;user unit&quot; classification for sewer capital charges and rents. The owner alleged that the law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village constructed a new sewer system. After public hearings, the village promulgated a &quot;user unit&quot; classification system for sewer capital charges and rents pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 451(1)(e). The system allocated a certain number of units to parties depending on their size and usage. The owner brought an action challenging the law as illegal and unconstitutional. The parties brought summary judgment motions. The trial court denied the owner's motion and granted the village's motion. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed. The court held that the system was not unconstitutional because it presented a reasonable response to the multiple concerns of the village, including issues as to the village's small size and antiquated water system, while ensuring that the sewer charges bore a reasonable relationship to the use of the system. However, the court held that the trial court should not have granted summary judgment to the village dismissing the compliant but should have declared the parties' rights; thus the court reinstated the complaint and granted judgment in favor of the village, declaring that the law was not illegal or unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The comptroller agreed to make the annual payments due. The interested party commenced a proceeding to prohibit disbursement of moneys to bondholders where such monies represented amounts of federal Medicaid funds the state legislature had not appropriated, contending that the allowance of future federal Medicaid funds to pay bondholders increased the debt obligation of the state without a public referendum. The trial court dismissed the petition on the ground of laches. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court held that the petition was brought six years following enactment of the legislation authorizing the challenged financing plan and nearly seven months following the sale of the challenged bonds. The court found that a recall of the issued bonds in reliance upon the enactment would cause traumatic disturbance to settled matters of public finances and governance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, State of New York Racing and Wagering Board and race tracks, sought review of orders entered in the Supreme Court of Schenectady County (New York), which denied defendants' motions for summary judgment in plaintiff off-track betting parlor operators' action challenging the board's implementation of a regulation that required the off-track betting parlor operators to return gains garnered from positive missed pools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1983, the board promulgated N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 5204.1(c)(1), which required off-track betting parlor operators (operators) to return to later common pools the gains garnered from positive missed pools. The regulation was not implemented until October 8, 1991, when the board ordered the operators to make available missed pool moneys that had accumulated from the date the regulation was promulgated through the end of 1990. The operators filed an action alleging that the board did not have power to promulgate the regulation or the October 8, 1991, directive. The lower court denied defendants' motions for summary judgment, as the action was barred by the four-month statute of limitations. On appeal, the court reversed. The court determined that the administrative action the operators were challenging was the promulgation of the regulation that became final and binding in 1983 when the board published the regulation, that it was evident that the operators understood the regulation's consequences in 1983, and that the challenge to the regulation filed more than six years after its effective date was barred by the four-month statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by reversing the lower court's order denying defendants' motions for summary judgments filed in the off-track betting parlor operators' action challenging the board's implementation of a regulation requiring the off-track betting parlor operators to return gains garnered from positive missed pools.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - When Cause of Action Accrues - Four-Month Statute of Limitations - Challenge to Regulation of State Racing and Wagering Board </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A challenge to the validity of a regulation issued by the State Racing and Wagering Board (9 NYCRR 5204.15) is barred by the four-month Statute of Limitations since plaintiffs did not commence the action until more than six years after the effective date of the regulation, which was the date that plaintiffs understood the regulation's consequences and were able to accurately assess its impact.  An administrative directive issued by the Board some eight years later did not affect the impact upon plaintiffs for limitations purposes since the directive was simply an incidental measure employed to effectuate the regulation. Therefore, even if the current action is deemed a declaratory judgment action, plaintiffs' first two causes of action are untimely.  However, inasmuch as plaintiffs' third cause of action is authorized by the regulation in question, Supreme Court properly severed it since the present state of the record precludes an informed determination of either its merits or the applicability of the limitations defense.  </SPAN></P>

Upon defendants' motion, the trial court suppressed evidence of the seized cocaine and dismissed the indictment, after making a finding that &sect; 375(30) was unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action regarding the constitutionality of the civil service examination procedures followed, defendants, city and related others, appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which denied defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff protestors' claims with respect to a civil service examination as time barred and granted the protestors' cross-motion for leave to renew and reargue their motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The protestors challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect;&sect; 50-a, 50-(7) regarding civil service exam procedures. Although the protestors failed to rebut the strong constitutionality of the statutes, the trial court declared one section unconstitutional on its face and the other as applied. The court held that such was improper and modified the order, in part, by denying the protestors' request for a declaration that the statutes were unconstitutional. The court further denied the protestors cross-motion for renewal and reargument, granted defendants' motion for leave to renew and reargue, and upon renewal, granted defendants' motion to dismiss the claims as time-barred. The court noted that when the legislature expressed its intent that judicial review on substantive matter was precluded, the merits of an agency's determination were not reviewable. The court further noted that even though the statutes did not specifically follow the test set forth in pre-enactment case law for the review of civil service exams, omitting one step in the review was the legislature's prerogative, and the trial court was not warranted in regarding such step as a constitutional directive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court unanimously modified, on the law, the facts and in the exercise of discretion, the order to the extent of denying the protestors' cross-motion for renewal and reargument; granting defendants' motion for leave to renew and reargue; and, upon renewal, granting defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims as to the civil service examination as time-barred. The court otherwise affirmed the order, without costs.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal by defendants, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 221-i was not unconstitutional and that it did not violate plaintiff's right to equal protection of the laws. The court found that the governmental statistics within the record indicated that not only was the full-time population of the City of White Plains greater than that of the City of Long Beach, but the cost of living in White Plains was almost double that of Long Beach. Accordingly, since the statistics indicated that White Plains was a more expensive place to reside, the court held that there was a rational basis for the retention of geographically disparate salaries between plaintiff and a judge of the City Court of White Plains.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the holding that LILCO was not obligated to the taxing jurisdictions for any real property taxes attributable to property it conveyed to LIPA that accrued after that conveyance, which occurred three months into the tax year. The court held that because N.Y. Pub. Auth.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Long Island Power Authority - Acquisition and Closure of Shoreham Nuclear Plant - Commencement of Payments in Lieu of Taxes Supreme Court correctly determined that, pursuant to the Long Island Power Authority Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which requires plaintiff Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), as part of its acquisition of the Shoreham nuclear power plant from plaintiff Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) for the purpose of closing and decommissioning the facility, to make certain payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTS) to defendants, the taxing jurisdictions within which the facility is located, &quot;in the first year after the acquisition&quot; in an amount equal to 100% &quot;of the taxes and assessments which would have been received by such taxing jurisdictions&quot; (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q [1]), LIPA's PILOT obligation commenced on March 1, 1992, the day after the facility was transferred to LIPA for $ 1.  Supreme Court thus correctly determined that LILCO is not obligated to defendants for any real property taxes for the 1991-1992 tax year attributable to the Shoreham property after it was conveyed to LIPA, and that it is consequently entitled to a refund for any taxes that it paid, attributable to that portion of the tax year that remained after the date of its transfer of the Shoreham property.  The payment made by LIPA to defendants on or about June 1, 1992 pursuant to the negotiated agreement between the parties must be characterized as the first installment of PILOTS and not as a tax payment. The statute should not be construed to make the PILOTS payable only at the end of the 1991-1992 tax year. No restriction is apparent on the face of the statute which would serve to postpone the commencement of PILOTS attributable to the Shoreham property.  The Legislature intended that the Act make PILOTS a complete substitution for real property taxes and assessments that otherwise would be due on the Shoreham property and the Act's provisions supersede any inconsistent laws (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-gg).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Long Island Power Authority - Acquisition and Closure of Shoreham Nuclear Plant - Calculation of Payments in Lieu of Taxes Supreme Court, in finding that the payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTS) plaintiff Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) is required to make under the Long Island Power Authority Act (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q [1]) as part of its acquisition of the Shoreham nuclear power plant from plaintiff Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO) for the purpose of closing and decommissioning the facility are to be based in the first instance on the &quot;taxes and assessments which LILCO would have been required to pay on the property conveyed to LIPA for the period March 1, 1992--February 28, 1993 had the conveyance to LIPA not occurred&quot; properly determined that the calculation of PILOTS is to be made subject to any adjustment in the assessed value of the Shoreham property occurring as a result of various tax certiorari proceedings commenced by LILCO under RPTL article 7.  Since the provision of the Act which provides that neither LIPA nor &quot;any other entity&quot; may seek a tax refund &quot;of property taxes originally assessed against the Shoreham plant&quot; (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q [3]) has been held unconstitutional as applied to LILCO, there is no statutory prohibition against the maintenance by LILCO of any tax certiorari proceeding with respect to the Shoreham property.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Long Island Power Authority - Acquisition and Closure of Shoreham Nuclear Plant - Calculation of Payments in Lieu of Taxes - Duration of Payments In an action to declare the obligations of the Long Island Power Authority to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTS) under Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020 as part of its acquisition of the Shoreham nuclear power plant from the Long Island Lighting Company, Supreme Court correctly concluded that LIPA's PILOT obligation is &quot;perpetual&quot; in an amount equal to the &quot;taxes and assessments which would have been levied on the plant in a nonoperative state&quot; since the statute does not limit the duration of PILOTS.  Furthermore, Supreme Court properly determined that the term &quot;nonoperative&quot; means &quot;incapable of generating electricity without regard to the Shoreham plant's state of construction&quot;.  Defining &quot;nonoperative&quot; to require LIPA to make perpetual PILOTS based on the value of a fully constructed nuclear plant on the Shoreham site would be contrary to the legislative intent of the Act.  </SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, in plaintiff therapists' action for a declaration that they were entitled to be enrolled in the New York State Teachers' Retirement System (retirement system).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The therapists alleged that they were entitled to membership in the retirement system as members of the &quot;teaching and supervisory staff&quot; of their school district as defined in N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 35(g), &quot;teachers or instructors&quot; as defined in N.Y. Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 40(b)(1)(e), and members of the &quot;teaching or professional staff&quot; as defined in N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 501(4). On appeal from the supreme court's denial of the employer's motion for summary judgment, the court concluded that because the therapists sought only to challenge determinations regarding their employment benefits, N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 review was proper. Accordingly, the court found that the supreme court erred in failing to convert the action to an art. 78 proceeding to which the four-month Statute of Limitations contained in N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 217 applied. The court therefore reversed the judgment, finding that the employer was entitled to summary judgment because the therapists' commencement of the action was untimely, the therapists having failed to file an action within four months after they were aggrieved by being notified that their membership in the retirement system was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents brought a hybrid proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 against respondent New York City public schools and others, to prohibit a condom availability component of an HIV/AIDS education program, and an action for judgment declaring that the condom distribution component was violative of their constitutional rights. The Supreme Court of New York, Richmond County, dismissed the action. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York City school program was designed to educate students about and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Part of the program called for high schools to make condoms available to students who requested them and did not include a provision for parental consent or &quot;opt out.&quot; The court held that the condom availability component of the program: (1) was contrary to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2504 and common law because it constituted &quot;health services&quot; to unemancipated minor children without the consent of their parents or guardians; (2) violated the parents' due process rights to direct the upbringing of their children because the policy was not essential to serving the compelling governmental interest in that minors could freely obtain condoms elsewhere; and (3) did not violate the Free Exercise Clause under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 because it did not prohibit the parents and/or their children from practicing their religion, or directly or indirectly coerce them to engage in conduct or practices contrary to their religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, finding the condom distribution program violative of statutory law, common law, and the Fourteenth Amendment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Students - Validity of Condom Availability Program - Parental Consent Respondents are prohibited from dispensing condoms to unemancipated minor students without the prior consent of their parents or guardians, or without an opt-out provision, as part of the expanded HIV/AIDS education program in New York City's public high schools. Whether the condoms are distributed as an adjunct of a plan of instruction on HIV/AIDS or through school health offices is of no import since the supplying of condoms is conduct which constitutes a health service separate and apart from health education </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2504; 8 NYCRR 136.1 [d]) and thus, in the absence of a provision requiring the prior consent of unemancipated minor students' parents or guardians, or in the absence of an opt-out provision, lacks common-law or statutory authority.  The primary purpose of the Board of Education is not to serve as a health provider.  No judicial or legislative authority directs or permits teachers and other public school educators to dispense condoms to minor, unemancipated students without the knowledge or consent of their parents.  Thus, the regulations of the State Education Department which authorize condom distribution without prior parental consent or opt out (8 NYCRR 135.3 [c] [2] [ii]) are contrary to the common law and are of no effect.  Furthermore, requiring parental consent or opt out for the condom availability component of respondents' program would not violate State and Federal statutory and constitutional law regarding the provision of family planning services to unemancipated minors under the Social Security Act and Public Health Service Act nor would it stymie every health care provider by compelling parental consent whenever an unemancipated minor seeks contraceptive services.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Students - Constitutionality of Condom Availability Program - Parental Consent Respondents' plan to dispense condoms to unemancipated minor children without the consent of their parents or guardians, or an opt-out provision, as part of an expanded HIV/AIDS education program in New York City's public high schools </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;8 NYCRR 135.3 [c] [2] [ii]) violates the constitutional substantive due process rights of the parent petitioners and similarly situated parents or guardians to direct the upbringing of their children.  By excluding parental involvement, the condom availability component of respondents' program impermissibly trespasses on petitioners' parental rights by substituting respondents in loco parentis, without a compelling necessity therefor.  Intrusion into the relationship between parent and child requires a showing of an overriding necessity and while the State has a compelling interest in controlling AIDS, interference in petitioners' rights is not necessary to meet this public health threat, especially since there are publicly funded nonschool programs where condoms are available to minors as part of confidential family planning, as provided under the Social Security Act and Public Health Service Act.  The distribution of condoms can go forward without interfering with petitioners' rights simply by allowing parents who are interested in providing appropriate guidance and discipline to their children to &quot;opt out&quot; by instructing the school not to distribute to their children without their consent.  </SPAN></P>

Nor does it directly or indirectly coerce them to engage in conduct or practices which are contrary to their religious beliefs.  No student who fails or refuses to participate is visited with a sanction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wholesaler appealed the summary judgment granted by the Supreme Court of Albany County (New York) in favor of defendant Department of Taxation and Finance (department), in the wholesaler's action for a declaratory judgment that the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 20A, et seq., was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wholesaler was a licensed cigarette stamping agent and a reseller of cigarettes. The legislature enacted the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 20A, et seq., which established price floors below which a wholesaler could not sell cigarettes. The wholesaler sought a declaratory judgment that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the Supremacy clause by violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1, et seq. The court held that state action was immune form antitrust laws if the state articulated a clear policy to allow anti-competitive conduct and the state actively supervised the anti-competitive conduct by private entities. The court held that the state had a clear and affirmative policy to protect and stabilize the cigarette industry within the state. The court held that the statute, which limited the minimum price to basic costs plus the cost of doing business, did not control the actual price because that was set by the manufacturers. The court held that the price could not be manipulated by concessions or rebates. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monopolies - Price Discrimination - Cigarette Marketing Standards Act Immune from Federal Sherman Antitrust Act by Reason of &quot;State Action&quot; Doctrine The Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA) (Tax Law art 20-A), which regulates the resale of cigarettes by establishing price floors below which an agent, wholesaler or dealer may not sell cigarettes, is immune from the Federal Sherman Antitrust Act (15 USC &sect; 1-7), and thus does not constitute an unlawful resale price fixing scheme, by reason of the &quot;State action&quot; doctrine in that the CMSA articulates a clear and affirmative policy to allow anticompetitive conduct and the State provides &quot;active supervision&quot; of anticompetitive conduct undertaken by private entities.  The details of the resale prices have been established as a product of deliberate State intervention and the anticompetitive scheme is that of New York, not private parties. Once the manufacturer establishes its price, the statutory scheme defines the price at which cigarettes may be resold, and it is thus the statute, not individual parties, that determines the ultimate resale price. Additionally, by structuring a detailed mechanism for determining the resale price, the State has satisfied the &quot;active supervision&quot; requirement of the &quot;State action&quot; doctrine.  Furthermore, the CMSA's exclusion of rebates and concessions in setting the minimum resale price does not allow private parties to manipulate the resale price of cigarettes in violation of the statutory scheme. Rebates and concessions, which are excluded from &quot;trade discounts&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;20 NYCRR 340.2 [a] [2] [iii]), have a legitimate business purpose and are lawful so long as they do not &quot;directly or indirectly serve to reduce the price below that at which cigarettes can be lawfully sold or purchased&quot; in this State (20 NYCRR 344.1 [b] [2]).  While those customers who receive a rebate or concession may make a greater profit on the transaction, the CMSA does not enable those same customers to engage in predatory pricing by undercutting their competitors.  Moreover, any manufacturer or purchaser which seeks to designate a rebate or a concession as a &quot;trade discount&quot; for the purpose of circumventing the CMSA is subject to both civil and criminal sanctions </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 484 [a] [5]; &sect; 1829).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies - Constitutionality of Cigarette Marketing Standards Act The Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA) (Tax Law art 20-A), which regulates the resale of cigarettes by establishing price floors below which an agent, wholesaler or dealer may not sell cigarettes, cannot be declared unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff, a licensed cigarette stamping agent and wholesale reseller of cigarettes, by reason of the refusal of defendant Department of Taxation and Finance to permit plaintiff' to apply a lesser markup percentage than that presumed by the statute since plaintiff has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, thereby preventing it from litigating the issue in a court of law.  </SPAN></P>

The teachers brought an action seeking a declaration that 1990 Laws 175, &sect; 1 was unconstitutional in that it violated the nonimpairment clause of the N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7. The teachers filed a motion for summary judgment and defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the teachers' motion and granted defendants' motion. On appeal, the court modified the judgment of the trial court by declaring that the contested statute was not invalid and otherwise affirmed the judgment. The court found that the deferral provision constituted a loan. However, the court found that the loan was not imposed on the board by the legislature because 1990 Laws 175, &sect; 1 expressly provided that the board had the option to either accept the deferral plan by adopting the valuation rate of interest or to veto it by refusing to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, recipient, utility, and others, appealed an order and judgment from the Supreme Court in Albany County (New York) denying plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, granting a cross-motion by defendant Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services for summary judgment, and declaring that N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged the amendment of &sect; 352.5(d) and the accompanying administrative directive. The legislature directed the promulgation of those provisions after amending N.Y. Soc. Serv.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Standing of Public Utility to Challenge Regulation Regarding Public Assistance for Utility Service Plaintiff public utility has standing as a taxpayer under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b to maintain an action to declare invalid an emergency regulatory amendment (18 NYCRR 352.5 [d]) and administrative directive of the Department of Social Services, which, in implementing the directive of Social Services Law &sect; 131-s (as amended by L 1992, ch 41, &sect; 128), require that persons seeking assistance to prevent a shut-off of utility service, who are not otherwise eligible to receive public assistance, sign an agreement to repay the utility assistance within one year as a condition to receiving such assistance.  Although the promulgation of the amended regulation and the administrative directive did not involve the expenditure of State funds, their implementation will and, inasmuch as plaintiff alleges that the expenditure of these funds will result in an unconstitutional disbursement and misapplication of State funds, it has standing to maintain this action.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Emergency Assistance - Payments Made for Utility Service - Validity of Regulation Requiring Applicants to Sign Repayment Agreements An emergency regulatory amendment (18 NYCRR 352.5 [d]) of the Department of Social Services, which, in implementing the directive of Social Services Law &sect; 131-s (as amended by L 1992, ch 41, &sect; 128), requires that persons seeking assistance to prevent a shut-off of utility service, who are not otherwise eligible to receive public assistance, sign an agreement to repay the utility assistance within one year as a condition to receiving such assistance, is not violative of the State's constitutional obligation to provide aid to the needy (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 1).  While the State may not refuse aid to the needy, it has discretion in determining the amount of aid, in classifying recipients and in defining the term &quot;needy&quot;.  Here, the denial of benefits only applies to persons who do not fall within the statutory definition of needy because their household income exceeds the public assistance standard of need and, therefore, are not eligible to receive public assistance. Furthermore, a person whose income diminishes to the public assistance standard may apply for and receive utility assistance even though such person may have defaulted upon a previously executed repayment agreement.  In addition, the amended regulation does not deny plaintiffs equal protection of the law since the authorizing statute and the regulation further the State's legitimate goal of allocating limited public assistance resources to the neediest applicants.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Emergency Assistance - Payments Made for Utility Service - Validity of Regulation Requiring Applicants to Sign Repayment Agreements An emergency regulatory amendment (18 NYCRR 352.5 [d]) of the Department of Social Services, which, in implementing the directive of Social Services Law &sect; 131-s (as amended by L 1992, ch 41, &sect; 128), requires that persons seeking assistance to prevent a shut-off of utility service, who are not otherwise eligible to receive public assistance, sign an agreement to repay the utility assistance within one year as a condition to receiving such assistance, and which further denies any subsequent assistance to persons who have not complied with a repayment agreement, does not create eligibility requirements and restrictions that exceed the statutory authority in violation of the fundamental principle of administrative law that agencies can only exercise those powers expressly delegated by the Legislature, together with those required by necessary implication.  The Commissioner's power to deny assistance is derived by implication from the statutory requirement which conditions the receipt of assistance upon the signing of a repayment agreement.  Without the power to deny assistance, the repayment agreement would be rendered essentially meaningless as it could be ignored with impunity because the failure to abide by it would have no immediate consequences.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Emergency Assistance - Payments Made for Utility Service - Validity of Regulation Requiring Applicants to Sign Repayment Agreements An emergency regulatory amendment (18 NYCRR 352.5 [d]) of the Department of Social Services, which, in implementing the directive of Social Services Law &sect; 131-s (as amended by L 1992, ch 41, &sect; 128), requires that persons seeking assistance to prevent a shut-off of utility service, who are not otherwise eligible to receive public assistance, sign an agreement to repay the utility assistance within one year as a condition to receiving such assistance, is not invalid for defining standard of need in a way that will expand the number of applicants required to sign repayment agreements by defining a &quot;household&quot; as consisting of all persons who occupy a housing unit, including related family members and all unrelated persons, and eliminating from consideration certain special nonrecurring items of need </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;18 NYCRR 352.1 [c]), since the Legislature clearly envisioned a narrowing of the eligibility standards as a means of achieving savings.  However, since the additional costs of meals for persons unable to prepare meals at home is a nonrecurring item that must by statute be included in the determination of standard of need (Social Services Law &sect; 131-a [2] [b]), the amended regulation is invalid to the extent that it excludes those additional costs from the definition of standard of need.  Furthermore, since the authorizing statute only requires persons whose household income exceeds the standard of need to sign repayment agreements, indicating a legislative intent to use income and not gross income in determining eligibility </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(cf.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 131-w), the regulation is also invalid to the extent that it requires standard of need to be determined upon gross income rather than income.  </SPAN></P>

Unless the spouse has signed the repayment agreement, he or she cannot be considered a debtor because a debtor-creditor relationship would not have been created between the person and the social services department. Nor can such spouse be considered a &quot;garnishee&quot; because a spouse's wages are not a debt owed to the recipient nor are they property in which the recipient has an interest ( CPLR 105 [i]).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge brought an action seeking a declaration that statutory provisions establishing disparate salaries among county judges were unconstitutional and in violation of his right to equal protection in that he received a lower salary than the county judges in other counties.

The judge filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by an affidavit from an economics expert. The state comptroller and State cross-moved for summary judgment to dismiss the complaint, asserting that geographic and cost-of-living variables provided a rational basis for the salary differences. The judge's summary judgment motion was granted. On review, the court affirmed that portion of the judgment finding that there was sufficient proof for the judge's assertions and no rational basis for the geographical distinctions in salaries. A territorial distinction which had no rational basis would not support a state statute.

Both he and the People appealed. Defendant claimed that his prior convictions were unconstitutionally obtained and that &sect; 70.08(3)(b) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court dismissed his appeal as abandoned, it reversed the sentence, and it vacated the trial court's judgment that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. Defendant failed to sustain his burden of showing that his prior convictions were unconstitutionally obtained because he was advised of his rights and freely admitted the earlier crimes. The court also ruled that the legislature's decision to classify all burglaries of a dwelling as a class C violent felony was entitled to great deference. Further, defendant had a criminal record and committed the instant offense while he was on parole. The instant offense, therefore, was no an isolated event. The court determined that his self-induced drug problem was not so extraordinary as to warrant a finding that the sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

In addition, plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction restraining Westchester County from enforcing this provision. The trial court entered a judgment in plaintiffs' favor and defendants appealed. Holding that the trial court properly determined that the defendants denied the plaintiffs their due process rights by failing to grant them notice and a hearing prior to the revocation of their licenses for the discharge of scavenger wastes into the county trunk sewer system and public sewers tributary thereto, the court determined that the trial court was correct in finding that plaintiffs' constitutional rights were violated.

Therefore, the property owner's action was moot. The court further found that the property owner had not made a claim for a temporary taking in the original complaint.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The party officials and former county Commissioner of Elections from the Democratic Party instituted the declaratory judgment action, asserting that N.Y.

After the former county Commissioner re-nominated himself for reelection, two county supervisors voted their combined 37 votes against his re-nomination, causing him not to receive the statutorily mandated 65 weighted votes. The Republican Party members of the board of supervisors abstained. The trial court held that the contention that insufficient negative votes were cast was without foundation in law and was based on faulty reasoning. The court agreed and affirmed the judgment because the import of the statutory language was that the board of supervisors, in failing to affirm the nomination, &quot;acted&quot; on the resolution by rejecting it. As to the statute's constitutionality, the court agreed that a challenge of its constitutionality was premature because the procedures outlined in the challenged statute had not yet been exhausted.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that &sect;&sect;506 and 507 were constitutional, even under an equal protection analysis, because they promoted a compelling state interest. The court determined that the state had long recognized the significance of jury trials and the importance of ensuring that jurors were drawn from as broad a cross-section of society as possible.

The court also found that the limitations on the franchise contained in &sect; 209-e(3) were constitutional as they related to the subject sanitation collection district and, thus, should have been complied with at the referendum.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted an act for the improvement of the state's infrastructure and provided for the funding of the improvements from the proceeds of bonds issued by state entities.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Taxpayers' Action Challenging Constitutionality of Debt-Incurring Legislation - Statutory Bond Authorization for Funding Local Highway and Bridge Improvement Programs Although plaintiffs have standing as registered voters to challenge, as an alleged violation of the constitutional referendum requirement for incurring State debt (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 11), the statutory financing mechanisms, whereby two public benefit corporations, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Thruway Authority, are authorized to issue moral obligation bonds, which expressly are not to be debts of the State, for the financing of mass transportation, bridge and highway projects from dedicated funds, backed by revenue from monies collected from State-wide taxes and fees, and subject to an annual appropriation by the Legislature (L 1993, ch 56), they lack standing to challenge the legislation as violative of either the constitutional prohibition against giving or loaning the State's credit in aid of a public corporation or private enterprise (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8) or the constitutional prohibition against the State assuming liability for the payment of obligations issued by a public corporation (NY Const, art X, &sect; 5).  Since plaintiffs are challenging the Legislature's authorization of bond issues, they cannot claim statutory standing pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b.  Furthermore, they also have no common-law standing as taxpayers to proceed with their nonvoter constitutional challenges in this situation.  Moreover, while voters have separate and independent standing to challenge financing schemes which are claimed to be subject to referendum approval, neither NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8 nor article X, &sect; 5 are linked to any voting rights.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equity - Laches - Taxpayers' Action Challenging Constitutionality of Debt-Incurring Legislation - Statutory Bond Authorization for Funding Local Highway and Bridge Improvement Programs Plaintiffs taxpayers' action commenced in 1993 challenging the constitutionality of those parts of Laws of 1993 (ch 56) which authorize additional bonding for local highway and bridge improvement programs pursuant to the original 1991 statutory financing mechanisms for funding local highway and bridge bonds (L 1991, ch 329, &sect; 11) as being violative of the proscription against the State contracting debt without voter approval (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 11), is barred by laches. Plaintiffs did not commence their action until almost two years after the legislation was enacted creating the challenged financing scheme and the municipalities, in reliance on the issuance of bonds by the Thruway Authority to fund various programs pursuant to the 1991 legislation, have expended funds and committed themselves to future programs with the expectation that they would be reimbursed.  To abort these programs at this point would create severe fiscal problems and cause undue disruption and prejudice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Statutory Bond Authorization for Funding Local Highway and Bridge Improvement Programs The statutory financing mechanisms, whereby two public benefit corporations, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Thruway Authority, are authorized to issue moral obligation bonds, which expressly are not to be debts of the State, for the financing of mass transportation, bridge and highway projects from dedicated funds, backed by revenue from monies collected from State-wide taxes and fees, and subject to an annual appropriation by the Legislature (L 1993, ch 56), are not violative of the constitutional referendum requirement for incurring State debt (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 11) since moral obligation debt does not constitute State debt within the meaning of the constitutional provision.  In order to constitute debt within the meaning of the State and local finance articles of the New York Constitution, the State or locality must legally be obligated to bondholders in the event of default. Here, the State clearly has no legal liability either on the Thruway Authority's State highway and bridge bonds or the railway and aviation bonds.  Both are expressly denominated to be obligations of the Thruway Authority and are backed solely by Thruway Authority revenue streams, not by the full faith and credit of the State.  In addition, there is no constitutional violation attendant to the fact that the revenue streams backing up the Thruway Authority bonds derive from State appropriations since the State can constitutionally give or lend money to assist a municipal or other public corporation in carrying out a public purpose.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the judgment, the court held that the political committee, which acted on its own behalf and not on behalf of its members lacked standing because: 1) it failed to establish that it would suffer any threatened or actual harm as a result of reapportionment; 2) the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973 only applied to persons whose right to vote was abridged or denied as a result of their race or color, not political association; and 3) it was not a member of the protected class under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985. In affirming the dismissal of the citizen's action, the court held that: 1) the Municipal Home Rule Law did not apply, as the county operated under a charter form of government; 2) the claim for violation of the Civil Rights Act failed to allege the that the reapportionment plan was instituted pursuant to an &quot;official policy or custom;&quot; and 3) the citizen's failed to show that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim, even though the reapportionment plan was constitutionally suspect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiff town to permanently enjoin defendant billboard owners from maintaining billboards, the billboard owners sought review of a decision of the Supreme Court, Suffolk County (New York), which granted the town's motion for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The billboard owners maintained two billboards. The town amended its zoning ordinance to essentially prohibit the maintenance of commercial billboards that advertised a product, service, or establishment that was not the principal product, service, or establishment found on the property. The amendments contained an amortization clause. However, they were struck down in their entirety because certain inseverable provisions were unconstitutional. The town again amended its ordinance to correct the constitutional infirmities but failed to include an amortization clause. The supreme court granted the town's motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the continued maintenance of the billboard owners' billboards. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that, in the absence of a clause that provided for a reasonable amortization period, the town could not rely upon the amendments to immediately terminate the billboard owners' nonconforming uses. Accordingly, the court held that the town was not entitled to injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers challenged the decisions of the Court of Claims (New York), which dismissed appellants' claims and found that the amendment allowing retroactive effect of a statute allowing police officers to recover for injuries sustained in the line of duties was unconstitutional to the extent that it retroactively applied to revive appellants' claims when final judgment had been obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers were injured when they attempted to apprehend a patient who had escaped from a mental institution. The patient had been listed as discharged on hospital records when he remained at large more than 30 days after his escape. Appellants' original suit was dismissed because recovery was against public policy. Subsequently, the legislature created a right of action for police officers injured in the line of duty and amended the statute to be applied retroactively. Appellants renewed their claims. The court of claims dismissed appellants' claims and found that the amendment was unconstitutional to the extent that it retroactively applied to revive appellants' claims when a final judgment had been obtained. The court reversed. It found that the validity of a statute was dependent on an existing moral obligation. The court noted that it was determined when the claims were previously presented that the injuries were proximately caused by respondent state's violation of its own regulations in marking the patient discharged. As such, appellants were entitled to recover and their motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment dismissing appellant police officers' claims for recovery. The statutory amendment allowing retroactive effect of a statute was constitutional and appellants were entitled to recover, even though final judgment on their claims had been obtained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Claim against State - Injuries Sustained by Police Officers while Attempting to Apprehend Escaped Mental Patient - Revival of Previously Dismissed Claims The Court of Claims erred when it declared, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sua sponte,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e (as amended by L 1990, ch 762), which revived certain otherwise time-barred claims of police officers who were injured in the line of duty as a direct or indirect result of a person's violation of a rule, law, statute or ordinance, was unconstitutional to the extent it could be retroactively applied to revive a previously dismissed action against the State by two police officers injured in 1979 while attempting to apprehend a dangerous escaped mental patient from a State facility.  The instant claims were lawfully revived by the statute which is not unconstitutional.  The Legislature may waive the rights of the State and recognize claims founded on equity and justice even where, as here, the transaction upon which the claims were founded had occurred long before and had previously been litigated to final judgment. What is essential to the validity of the statute waiving the rights of the State is an existing moral obligation, which, along with a sense of justice, is present in this case involving injuries to two police officers due to the negligence of the State, which injuries were sustained while the officers were performing their jobs in the service of the public good. Furthermore, since it was previously determined that claimants' injuries were proximately caused by the State's negligence in failing to prevent the patient's escape and in failing to take the proper steps to apprehend him after his escape, claimants are granted partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court affirmed defendant's conviction for rape and sodomy, it disallowed use of prior convictions to serve as a predicate for a persistent violent felony offender sentence. The trial court could find defendant guilty even though there was only one witness, and the circumstances supported the victim's testimony. However, one sentence was too old to extend defendant's sentence. Defendant should have had a chance to challenge another prior conviction on the ground that it was unconstitutionally obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction in part, as it could be based on one witness's testimony. The court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing, because one sentence was too old to show defendant was a persistent offender, and allowed defendant to challenge the constitutionality of his other sentence.</SPAN></P>
