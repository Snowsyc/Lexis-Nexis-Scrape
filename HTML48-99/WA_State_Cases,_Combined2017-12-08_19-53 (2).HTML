Rev. Code &sect; 19.86, the retail installment sales act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 63.14), and the unfair motor vehicle business practices act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.70. Appellant sought an adjudication that certain acts of respondents constituted statutory violations, an order restraining respondents from engaging unfair business practices, civil penalties, and restitution for those harmed by respondents' acts. The court reversed the lower court judgment and remanded for trial because the pleadings, affidavits, and other materials in the file did not establish as a matter of law that respondent was an inactive, defunct corporation which would have made the actions moot. The court determined that a preliminary issue of fact had been raised by appellant as to whether the alleged wrongful behavior could reasonably be expected to recur on the part of respondents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State Department of Highways sought review of a decision of the Shorelines Hearings Board (Washington), which remanded a decision to a city to reconsider its prior issuance of a substantial development permit under the Shoreline Management Act of 1971, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.58. The matter was transferred to the court to determine the issue of appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents filed a request with the Board to review a city's order granting the permit to the Department. The Board conducted hearings to determine whether respondents were persons aggrieved within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.58.180. Later, the Board remanded the matter to the city with directions to reconsider its issuance of the permit in light of new environmental impact statements ordered in an unrelated federal case. The Department applied to the superior court for review of the Board's order and respondents moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the proper jurisdiction was in the court of appeals. The matter was transferred, upon the request of the Department, to the supreme court to determine the conflict between the review procedure provided in the Pollution Control Hearings Board Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.21B, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.04. The court held that the review procedure provided under &sect; 34.04 applied because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.58.180(3) provided that where such a conflict existed, the provisions of the APA controlled. As such, the superior court had original jurisdiction to review the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case the superior court to review the record made before the Shorelines Hearings Board and to pass upon the remaining contentions of the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, citizens, residents, and taxpayers, filed applications for writs of prohibition challenging the constitutionality of two separated legislative enactments, and seeking to prohibit disbursement of public funds for tuition of students at nonpublic schools in the State of Washington. The first action was against respondents, Superintendent of Public Instruction and State Treasurer, and involved financial assistance in grades 1 through 12 for needy and disadvantaged students attending public and private schools. The second action was against respondents, Council on Higher Education and State Treasurer, and provided for a tuition supplement program to students attending independent or private institutions of higher education. The cases were consolidated for hearing. The court held that the legislative enactments and the plans implementing them violated Wash. Const. art. 9, &sect; 4 and U.S. Const. amend. I because public funds were transferred to schools having a substantial religious purpose and denominational character. The court determined that Wash. Const. art. 9, &sect; 4 provided an absolute prohibition to providing public funds to schools under &quot;sectarian control or influence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged an order of the Superior Court for King County (Washington), which dismissed the charges that were filed against defendants, under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sustained the constitution-based demurrer that defendants filed in their trial on charges of giving or offering payment to persons to solicit or to procure signatures on an initiative petition under &sect; 29.79.490(4) and dismissed the charges. The court reversed that judgment on appeal and remanded the case. The court reasoned that &sect; 29.79.490(4) represented a valid exercise of the state's police power, noting the state's substantial interest in maintaining the elective processes' integrity. The court also opined that &sect; 29.79.490(4) bore a reasonable and a substantial relation to dealing with the possibility that those who were paid to solicit signatures would adopt measures, employ tactics, and assert pressures that were inconsistent with a free and uncorrupted exercise of the right of initiative. The court further concluded that &sect; 29.79.490(4) did not violate the First Amendment because it did not impair the right to assemble or make the solicitation of signatures on an initiative petition illegal, noting that paying persons to collect signatures had no necessary relationship to exercising that right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the first-degree murder of a 13-year old boy after he confessed to the crime and told the police where the victim's body was located. At trial, defendant was found by the superior court to be competent to assist his counsel in his defense, and it was further found that defendant's confession was freely and voluntarily given. After the trial, the jury found defendant sane and guilty of the crime, with the special finding that the death sentence be imposed. The court reversed defendant's sentence and remanded the case for resentencing, holding that recent case precedent had the effect of preventing the imposition of the death penalty under the existing state statutes. The court affirmed defendant's conviction on the grounds that the state met its burden of showing that defendant's confession was voluntarily given, and that the superior court properly instructed the jury on &quot;irresistible impulse&quot; and did not err in admitting into evidence two colored photographs of the victim's body in a decomposed state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the court found that the university's policy of considering race as an admissions criteria did not violate the equal protection clause or the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reasoned that the policy was necessary to promote a compelling state interest. The court found that the state had a compelling interest in promoting integration in public education. The court reasoned that the minority groups participated on an equal basis in the tax support of the law school but were seriously underrepresented in the law school. The court also found that there was a shortage of minority attorneys, prosecutors, judges, and public officials. Therefore, the court reasoned that the state's interest in eliminating the racial imbalance within public legal education was compelling. Finally, the court found that the consideration of race in the law school admissions policy met the test of necessity. The court reasoned that racial imbalances in the law school and the legal profession could only be corrected by providing legal education to those minority groups that had been previously deprived. Further, the court found that no less restrictive means would serve the governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant threatened to kill her mother if she had her re-committed and did kill her. Defendant was found incompetent to stand trial and was confined to the state hospital until she was found competent to proceed and was subsequently found guilty of first-degree murder. The court affirmed. The court stated that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on diminished mental capacity and manslaughter. The court held that in order to support an instruction on diminished mental capacity not only must there have been substantial evidence of such a condition, but the evidence must have logically and reasonably connected defendant's alleged mental condition with the asserted inability to form the required specific intent to commit the crime charged. The court stated that the evidence did not provide the necessary nexus.

The option was not exercised but the Port later obtained the property from a partnership that had purchased it from the sellers. The Attorney General alleged that the Port had overpaid for the parcel and had not received fair market value when it resold most of the parcel to a buyer. Consequently, the Attorney General argued that the Port had made an unconstitutional gift of money to the other parties. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the Port, finding sufficient evidence to support the trial court's factual findings as to the value of the property. The prices discussed in the option situation did not bind the parties in the later transaction. The Port had not used the property to make harbor improvements and did not need special budgetary dispensation or a comprehensive plan in order to engage in the transaction.

The applicants filed an action against the city challenging the one-year durational requirement. The trial court found that the requirement was unconstitutional and granted the applicants' request that they be allowed to compete on an equal basis with all other applicants for civil service positions. The city appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the city was not permitted to impose a one-year durational residency requirements upon the applicants who were otherwise valid residents. The court found that the city offered no argument that it had a compelling state interest to justify the durational residency requirement Thus, the requirement violated the applicants' constitutional right to travel and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reasoned that the durational residency requirement penalized recent travel by completely and unconditionally depriving those recently migrating to the city, regardless of their status as bona fide residents, of the right to apply for employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after he hung an upside-down American flag on which he had affixed a peace sign in masking tape. Defendant's conviction was reversed by the appellate court and reinstated by the court. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.86.020, under which defendant was convicted, did not require evil intent or design and therefore the violation was complete when defendant knowingly placed the peace sign on the flag. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague because as applied to defendant, the charge was well laid and the statute was constitutionally precise. The court concluded that a state could constitutionally bar the public employment and display of an American flag as a background for advertising a cause, philosophy, religion, or product because the nation had the right to adopt a national emblem and the states had a right to protect it. The court held that depriving defendant of the right to use the American flag as a background did not impair his freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss her case because the evidence failed to show apprehension on the part of the victim or sufficiently strong circumstantial evidence of a willful act by defendant. She also claimed she was improperly sentenced because &sect; 9.41.025 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It affirmed the assault conviction, finding no error in the instructions or the trial court's action regarding the assault charge. It reversed on the deadly weapon, however, because defendant was denied due process on that aspect of the case. Evidence was introduced by the State to show that defendant had threatened to kill the victim and that sometime following this threat, while the victim was in her residence, she heard a noise thought to be a firecracker. Later examination of the room showed a bullet lodged in the wall. No constitutional right was violated by a failure to give a circumstantial evidence instruction. However, the information failed to charge defendant with an added penalty, under &sect; 9.41.025(1), or to allege specific acts under the statute's added penalty provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the procedures of defendants in holding persons arrested without warrants on open charges or suspicion for unreasonable lengths of time. The taxpayers alleged that the illegal acts involved the illegal expenditure of public funds.

They also requested that the defendants be required to submit a plan to implement the judgment of the court. The trial judge concluded that the taxpayers lacked standing and granted defendants' motion for a summary judgment. The court of appeals affirmed, but it did not reach the question of standing. On review, the court affirmed the part that the taxpayers lacked standing to prosecute the action because they did not make demand on the attorney general to institute proceedings to prevent the illegal expenditure of funds. The court reversed in part the holding that the trial court lacked power to grant the requested relief because a judiciary could act when protected rights were invaded.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 50.04.323(1) was unconstitutional because in setting eligibility requirements for unemployment compensation, it violated both the privileges and immunities clause of the state constitution and the equal protection clause of the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon review, the court found that where the state administers finite resources a statutory discrimination would not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it. The unemployment compensation fund was clearly a finite source regardless of the fact that the federal government reimbursed the state for unemployment compensation. Payments under government compensation pension plans are a form of deferred compensation for past services rendered to the employer. Since Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.04.320 defined remuneration under the Employment Security Act as all compensation paid for personal services the treatment of pension payments in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 50.04.323(1) as &quot;remuneration&quot; was both logical and reasonable. Because there was a reasonable basis, the court held the statute to be constitutional. Moreover, the court ruled that the relative clause &quot;to which a base year employer has contributed on behalf of such individual&quot; modified the word &quot;plan&quot; not &quot;payments.&quot;</SPAN></P>

On review, the warehouse owner urged that a material question of fact was presented. He claimed that the construction was not an improvement to real property within Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.300 et seq., but that it constituted installation of a removable trade fixture, which would have been personalty.

The police power of the state allows states to enact legislation to protect the health, welfare and safety of the public. However, the court found that the statute was not enacted to protect the public but to protect the financial interests of a class of health care providers. The statute operated to take the property of the participating and contributing members of a prepaid health care program without due process of law, and granted special privileges and immunities to defendants. Not being a member of the program and contributing nothing to it, and not sharing in the problems or costs of management, defendants under the aegis of this statute and the compulsory indemnity features nevertheless could share in all of the benefits.

More than four years later, the employee was convicted of a felony. The police pension fund applied Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.20.110 and discontinued payments to the employee. The trial court reinstated the employee's pension fund payments, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the employee's failure to serve the attorney general was not fatal to the case. The evidence established that the attorney general waived service and chose not to become involved in the litigation. The court determined that the retirement pension fund was contractual. The employee's right to the pension accrued with the performance of his work as a police officer and vested entirely upon his retirement; therefore, the employer had no right to revoke the employee's pension because the employee committed a criminal act more than four years after he was fully vested that was not related to pension fund in any manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 75.12.650 prohibited the use of sports gear for commercial salmon fishing. The fishery filed for injunctive and declaratory relief. The trial court held that &sect; 75.12.650 was not a valid exercise of police power because it had no real relation to the objectives of the Department, and that it discriminated within a class in violation of the Washington and United States Constitutions. The trial court found for the fishery and defendants appealed. The court reversed the trial court, noting that the State was enacting legislation concerning its own property and the methods which citizens could use to acquire it. The court said that &sect; 75.12.650 was aimed at making sport and commercial fishing distinct, policing violators, decreasing the number of sport-caught fish which entered commerce, and improving the management of the salmon industry. Section 75.12.650 was reasonably related to the Department's objectives, the court continued, because it prevented the dual commercial and sport uses of a troller's license and allowed the Department to gather more accurate statistics. The State could classify its citizens for various purposes, the court concluded.</SPAN></P>

The shareholder, who had attended the meeting, petitioned the court to vacate the order that appointed the representative. The trial court denied his petition.

It found that the shareholder had standing to challenge the action because it affected his rights in the corporation, and he was not required to test the constitutionality of the statute by an independent action for declaratory relief. The court held &sect; 23A.08.305 was unconstitutional because it violated the procedural due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the business and occupation tax imposed by city ordinance was unconstitutional and a refund of taxes paid.

On appeal the court held that the applicability of the tax and classification for the sales tax was the same as for the state sales tax, as found in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.050. This definition was made applicable to the city by Tacoma, Wash. Code &sect; 6.86.010. However, the denomination of plaintiff's activities as retail sales, for the purposes of the state's business and occupation tax, was not binding on the city. The court found that different classifications for the purposes of two taxes did not violate the equal protection and due process of law. The city had broad powers of taxation.

The employer was officially recognized by the state as a charitable institution and the description that was given to the type of living arrangements of the residents did not alter the charitable nature of the employee's undertaking.

The court found that consideration for a lottery could consist of either gain to defendant or detriment to its participants. Attracting participants' attention and increasing sales was sufficient consideration to find that sweepstakes were illegal lotteries. On cross-appeal, the court held that similar federal statutes were instructive but not dispositive in interpreting state statutes. Both common sense rules and process of gradual judicial inclusion and exclusion were used to interpret the phrase &quot;unfair trade practice.&quot; Defendant had sufficient notice that a lottery was an unfair trade practice; thus the statute was held not to be unconstitutionally vague. The statute conferred jurisdiction over defendant under state long arm laws. The court found that state regulation of lotteries was not preempted by regulation of the mail. Finally, the court held that the FTC was not a regulatory body within the meaning of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.86.170 which exempted activities administered by regulatory bodies.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 19.31.050 to approve fee schedules and was also authorized to issue rules and regulations, the director could issue rules or guidelines delineating the types of contracts or fee levels subject to automatic approval. Further, the requirement of specific legislative standards was without purpose or rational justification. Accordingly, because the legislature set forth guidelines in general terms and provided for adequate procedural safeguards, the challenged delegation of legislative power was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision of the trial court as to &sect; 49.60.225, but affirmed the dismissal of the complaint against the purchasers. The court determined that the judicial power exercised by the tribunal was properly delegated to it, and the tribunal's power to fix the amount of the penalty was consistent with due process because the exercise of similar power by courts of law was universal and was consistently upheld. The court determined that the purchasers could not be held to have aided and abetted housing discrimination unless he carried out the transaction for that purpose, and there was no evidence that they purchased the property in order to further aid or abet housing discrimination.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for King County, Washington, dismissed the prosecution. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the case against defendants, holding that the grand jury lost its de jure existence in the evening of May 10, 1971 when the legislature enacted Criminal Investigatory Act of 1971 and that the statute under which the charges were laid was void. In reversing, the court held that the King County grand jury continued to exist, and was valid, in the evening hours of May 10, 1971. The court found that it was against good common sense and the interests of society to hold otherwise. The court also held that the prosecuting attorney was not given a choice to charge under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.22.010 for a violation that was a gross misdemeanor or under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.22.040, for conspiracy, which was a felony. The court found &sect; 9.22.040, taken from 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 371, was valid under the indictments because a conspiracy to commit several crimes was but one conspiracy, one crime, and one punishment. The court held that the Washington conspiracy statute, like its federal counterpart, did not violate the ex post facto provision of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that defendants were required to answer to the criminal charges against them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the separation from his wife, the decedent lived in a family relationship with the partner and ran a cattle-raising business. The partner claimed an interest in the decedent's estate on the basis of an implied partnership. On appeal, the court reversed the superior court's judgment, finding that the partner had an interest on the basis of an implied partnership. The existence of a partnership to operate a business for profit was implied from the partner and the decedent's combining their property, labor, and skill to run a successful business operation. The partner participated in business decisions relating to management and the day-to-day operations. The court found no contract to make a will because the partner was unable to prove the existence of an express contract. The court did not need to address the presumption that a meretricious relationship could not give rise to community property because the partner based her claim on an implied partnership. The court affirmed the appellate court's conclusion that the partner was precluded from raising the issue of change of venue because she failed to appeal it at the time the final judgment was entered.</SPAN></P>

Both had been called as witnesses before a county grand jury, but each refused to answer any questions.

Laws ch. 67, &sect;&sect; 2(7), 5, 1st Exec. Sess.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special inquiry judge asked each relator to answer the questions they had refused to respond to before the grand jury. When they refused, the judge found them in contempt and placed in the county jail. On appeal, the court disagreed with relators' contention that 1971 Wash. Laws ch. 67, &sect; 13, 5, 1st Exec. Sess. provided that they could only punished by a criminal prosecution. Even if that section were to be so construed, a legislative attempt to abolish or abridge the courts' inherent contempt powers would be unconstitutional and void. The orders were not defective; each fully complied with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.20.030. Although the orders did not specify the relators would be released upon dismissal of the grand jury, that limitation could be fairly inferred from the order's language. A finding that the order was in the public interest was not required by the 1971 act. The only proper method for the relators to challenge the court's authority would have been by appeal, even if their grounds were that the court had no authority. A grand jury witness was not entitled to challenge the authority of the grand jury, given that the grand jury had at least de facto existence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both parties sought a divorce and the trial court entered a judgment. The ex-husband appealed. The court found that it was within the authority of the trial court to make provisions for the support and education of the child of the parties until the child reached 21 because the amendment to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.28.010 lowering the age of majority to 18 years was enacted after the judgment. The court found that the decree should be modified to terminate when the child reached age 21 and that the award of child support was not an abuse of discretion. The trial court did not provide a specific amount for future education costs but those costs and expenses that were reasonably necessary were implied. The court affirmed the award of alimony as the ex-wife was qualified for housework only and had a need for support until she could become trained. The court found that the property inherited by the ex-husband was his separate property, but the community had a lien to the extent of enhanced value due to the community's improvements. It was not unreasonable for the trial court to award judgment to the ex-wife, and attorney's fees were within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which rejected the auditor's argument. The court determined that the prohibition against loans by a municipality in &sect; 7 was never intended to include deposits in banking institutions which were protected against loss, primarily by the credit of the United States government. The court decided that the purposes and objectives of &sect; 7 was the security and protection of public funds, and that the prohibition was against the risk of loans as known in their ordinary sense and not a debtor-creditor relation arising from the depositing of funds in a legal depositary, which were approved in Wash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The construction company had no office within the city but contracted with the city for work on a construction project outside of the city limits. The contract was signed in the city and the business and occupation tax was assessed against the company based on the gross receipts of the contract made with the city. The company challenged the tax and the trial court found the tax partially unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court found that executing a contract with the city was the &quot;taxable event,&quot; and that the taxable incident formed a sufficient contact with the city to give, as a matter of due process, jurisdiction to impose the tax. Neither the fact that the work was performed elsewhere nor the fact that the company had no office within the city was determinative. The contract was signed in the city, and this provided a sufficient nexus upon which to base the tax for all receipts from the contract work.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court for Whatcom County (Washington), which found in favor of defendant city in the applicant's declaratory judgment action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant applied to run for a position in the city on a board of freeholders who were to draft a new city charter. The city denied the application on the ground that the applicant owned no real property in the city. The applicant filed a declaratory judgment proceeding, and the superior court upheld the validity of the city's action. The applicant appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the city ordinance conditioning the applicant's qualification for office on his property ownership violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Wash. Const. amend. 40. In addition, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 35.22.140, 35.22.050, which authorized the adoption of the ordinance, were unconstitutional. The freeholder requirement arguably made possession of wealth a basis for the classification, and it violated the constitutional right to travel. A declaratory judgment was the appropriate remedy to redress the injury which otherwise became moot when the election was held; the applicant did not attempt the harsh remedy of blocking or overturning the election and the matter was one of continuing and substantial public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor, acting pursuant to Wash. Rev.

The governor's action compelled the trustees to withdraw funds from the system's PRF in order to meet current pension liabilities. In their writ of mandamus petition, the retired teacher, the current teacher, and the education association sought the restoration of the general funds to the system, and the restoration of the funds withdrawn from the PRF. The court issued the writ because the legislature, in enacting Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.88.110 and 1969 Wash. Laws 282, did not intend to confer upon the governor the power to modify the systematic funding program that was studiously formulated to maintain the financial stability of the system.

On review, defendant asserted that the trial court erred by failing to eliminate the element of rape or attempted rape from five instructions related to the felony-murder charge. The court held that although there was no direct evidence that defendant raped the victim, there was strong circumstantial evidence from which the jury could have concluded that defendant raped her. Therefore, the court concluded that there was substantial evidence tending to establish both rape and its perpetrator, that the jury had been instructed on the use of circumstantial evidence, and that the trial court properly submitted the issue of rape to the jury under the five instructions basic to the felony-murder charge.

Const. art. 7, &sect; 2 which provided that land should be valued for tax purposes at its fair cash market value. The court granted the county tax assessor's petition for a writ of prohibition and concluded that the State constitution did not leave any latitude in the legislature to alter, reduce, or amend the constitutional concept of true and fair value in money or permit the imposition of an extraneous formula to be employed by the assessing authority in determining the true and fair market value of property. The court ruled that a reduction in property value by what an administrative agency might determine to be the reasonable costs of sale represented a dramatic departure from the constitutional mandate that property must be assessed at 50 percent of its true and fair value.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney admitted that he failed to pay the required membership fee in order to precipitate the instant action. The attorney argued that the mandatory suspension of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.48.160 for nonpayment of dues was an unconstitutional usurpation of the Washington Supreme Court's judicial power. The court denied the attorney's petition. The court noted that it had the power to suspend an attorney from the practice of law or to take disciplinary action. The court also noted that it did not share the power of discipline, disbarment, suspension, or reinstatement with either the legislature or the state bar association and that the ultimate constitutional power clearly lay within its jurisdiction. The court further conceded that although the board of bar governors of the Bar routinely proceeded with the suspension procedure, it did not exercise its exclusive power to issue an order of suspension. The court reasoned that the attorney was still able to practice, until such an order was issued.

Twenty-nine days after the effective date of the ordinance confirming the assessment roll, the owners filed an appeal with the trial court. After the trial court granted the city summary judgment, the owners sought review. Upon review, the city claimed that the initial appeal was untimely because the owners failed to appeal the ordinance confirming the assessment within &sect; 35.44.210's 10-day period. In affirming, the court held that the 10-day period was not unconstitutionally short. The court also held that the 10-day period did not constitute a denial of due process in the absence of direct and actual notice. In so holding, the court noted that the owners had constructive notice of any public proceeding openly taken by the city and that by examining the public records, the owners could have ascertained both when the ordinance was up for enactment and the time of its adoption.

The court also ruled that &sect; 11.40.011 did not violate Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12 or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court determined that there was no equal protection violation because &sect; 11.40.011 applied alike to all within the class it set up, estates protected by liability insurance, and because a reasonable ground existed for subjecting estates covered by liability insurance to a longer statute of limitations, the fact that claims subject to &sect; 11.40.011 did not affect the interests of heirs and beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court concluded that defendant's contentions were without merit. The trial judge correctly denied defendant's motion to dismiss for failure of the prosecution to prove its case correctly because, as a matter of law, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.40.060 was intended to prohibit the sale of LSD. It was the function of the courts of the state to construe and determine the application of the laws passed by the legislature. It was fully within the power of the trial court to find that LSD was a substance prohibited by &sect; 69.40.060. Criminal statutes did not need to meet absolute standards of specificity. The test was whether the language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. In proscribing the use or sale of lysergic acid or its derivatives, the legislature clearly intended its prohibition to apply to LSD.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of grand larceny under an information charging that she obtained public assistance by means of fraud and deceit. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the statute was not vague and that an applicant for or recipient of public assistance, possessing ordinary understanding, should have known that public assistance grants by their very nature depended on such things as eligibility, need, resources, and income. Defendant, having failed to bring the matter on for hearing and determination well in advance of trial and there being no showing in the record demonstrating how or why the information was so indefinite and uncertain that defendant was unable to prepare her defense to it, the court thought that the trial court properly denied the motion raised at trial. The record, moreover, showed no denial of due process of law in overruling the motion. Couched as it was in the language of the statute and there being no affirmative showing in the record that defendant was not sufficiently informed of the nature of the charges so as to be able to defend against them, the information was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was properly denied by the trial court because the evidence used in support of the motion was not in fact newly discovered and also could have been ascertained by defendant in the exercise of due diligence, prior to trial. The court further held that testimony of a witness at trial regarding a statement made by one of the murder victim's was properly admitted due to the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule and because the statement was made very close in time to the victim's disappearance prior to her murder. The court also found that defendant was competent to stand trial and upheld the trial court's withdrawal of defendant's insanity plea from the jury because of testimony of psychiatrists establishing his competence and the fact that defendant did not present evidence to show that he was insane. The court further rejected defendant's claim that he should have been given a bifurcated trial and held that the same jury that tried the issue of guilt could also determine whether to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The attorney filed a sworn declaration of intent to become a citizen and was eligible for citizenship in a few years. The attorney passed the bar examination and met all qualifications for bar admission other than that of American citizenship. The association denied the attorney bar membership. On review, the court granted the attorney's petition for admission to the bar. The court held that the amendments to the Admission to Practice Rules opened bar membership to otherwise qualified resident aliens who had declared their intent and were proceeding with due diligence to become citizens. Thus, the requirement of American citizenship for bar admission had been modified to permit a resident alien to be admitted to the bar, subject to revocation of his license should he fail to seasonably attain citizenship. Because the attorney had met all qualifications for admission to practice, the court ordered that he be admitted to the bar upon taking the oath of office and payment of the required fees.</SPAN></P>

The Department contended: that the additional warning by the arresting officers was not a condition precedent to revocation; that to hold otherwise would be adding another element, not presently in the statute, as grounds for revocation of a driver's operating license; and that the material elements essential for a revocation had been met. On review, the court disagreed with the rationale of the Department. It held that the statute was clear and unambiguous, and in mandatory language in the conjunctive. Thus, the trial court correctly held that the failure to inform the driver of his right to have additional tests administered pursuant to the statute invalidated the Department's revocation of his driver's license for failure to submit to a chemical test of his breath or blood as provided in Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was walking on a highway shoulder when defendant's car allegedly struck and killed him. The court opined that based on the car's description by a witness, testimony that defendant got into his car alone nearby just before the accident, the similarity between paint on the car and debris from the victim's clothing, and a hood ornament at the scene from defendant's car, evidence was sufficient that defendant was the driver who struck the victim. The court noted that before the accident defendant drank two glasses of wine at two taverns, that he was rowdy and was asked to leave, and that three state troopers saw him intoxicated. The court rejected the argument that jury instructions failed to require a causal connection between intoxication and the victim's death. The court noted that the deputy coroner found the victim's neck broken and that the cause of death was a fact question for the jury. The court rejected the contention that the &quot;hit and run&quot; statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.52.020, requiring a driver in an accident to give his name, address, and vehicle license number at the scene and show his driver's license, violated the privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed holding that defendant's words did not constitute disorderly conduct under the circumstances. Giving the ordinance a reasonable interpretation, the court held that it was not intended to prohibit conduct, which was customarily considered acceptable at events such as political rallies. Defendant's shouting the word &quot;warmonger&quot; at a political candidate but once--without more to indicate a further purpose or intention of breaking up the meeting, or to deprive the speaker of his audience, or to interfere with the rights of others to hear, or the speaker to speak--did not amount to a disturbance of the peace, in fact or in law.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were among a group, made up primarily of students, who assembled in the administration building outside of the college president's office. They were protesting the expulsion of the expelled student. After more than 24 hours, the president and public officials asked them to leave and warned them they would be arrested if they did not. The entire group was arrested. Defendants were tried with four others in district court and found guilty. Defendants appealed and had a de novo trial in superior court, which found them guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.87.010(13) was constitutional because it sufficiently defined the elements of vagrancy. The court found that it was not inconsistent for defendants to have been acquitted of violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.27.060 and to have been found guilty of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.27.070 because the elements for each were different. The court found that criminal intent was not required for a conviction under &sect; 9.27.070.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water district adopted a resolution declaring its intent to construct and furnish sewage service in its district. The legislature passed 1967 Wash. Laws, Ex. Sess. ch. 135, &sect; 3 subsequent to the resolution. Pursuant to the act, the Commission and Department adopted regulations that were to be used in applying for an approval and a certification of necessity. They informed the water district that it could not proceed with its sewer system until it obtained approvals and certifications of necessity. The water district filed a declaratory judgment action against the Commission and Department, claiming that the act was invalid. The trial court ruled that the act did not violate the Washington Constitution. The court held that the act did not violate Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19. The amendatory act's requirements of written approval and a certification of necessity were within the purview of the title of the original act. The subjects contained in the body of the act were naturally and reasonably connected with the general subject, expressed in the title.

The trial court found the railroad guilty and the railroad sought review. The court held that: (1) the power of the states to require spark arresters had not been decided by the federal courts; (2) states, in the exercise of their police power, could prescribe regulations applicable to interstate commerce for the protection of their citizens' property against danger to the extent that those regulations did not conflict with federal legislation and did not impose a substantial burden upon interstate commerce; (3) the requirement of spark arresters served the critical state purpose of fire prevention and imposed no significant burden on the railroad; and (4) the statute was not vague or indefinite.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not conclude that the picture was obscene in its entirety, but rather that individual portions or scenes of the movie were obscene. Defendant argued that the seizure of the motion picture film for evidentiary purposes without a prior adversary hearing on the question of its obscenity constituted a prior restraint on his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The court held that a clear and searching inquiry into the nature of the claimed obscenity of the movie was made before the seizure was authorized. The court concluded that the procedure followed in the trial court substantially complied with the pre-seizure mandates. Therefore, the court held that the seized film was properly admissible in evidence. Finally, the court held that it was satisfied that under the circumstances of this case defendant was rightly convicted for exhibiting an obscene motion picture film because his exhibition of an arguably obscene film in close proximity to the homes and highways of the community posed more than an unreasonable annoyance to the public. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

When the State re-offered the timber for public bid and awarded a contract to another, the buyer amended its action to ask for damages. The Superior Court for Cowlitz County, Washington, dismissed the buyer's action with prejudice. The buyer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State auctioned three species of timber from State-owned normal school lands. The State's offering was based on presale uncruised estimated quantities. At the auction, the buyer was the apparent high bidder with an offer of $ 683,785. The State became suspicious of the high bidding and ordered confirmation of the sale delayed pending a post-sale cruise. The completed cruise disclosed that the State had seriously erred in its presale estimates. As a result, the buyer was not the high bidder. Rather, due to the differences in &quot;weighted&quot; bids of other bidders, the apparent third highest bidder was, in actuality, the highest bidder. The court affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of the State. The court stated that it was not unconstitutional for the State to reject the buyer's bid, after the auction, upon the ground that it would not have served the &quot;best interests&quot; of the State as provided in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 79.01.212. Further, because the buyer was not, in fact, the high bidder at the auction, the acceptance of his lower bid was a statutory ground for rejection of the sale. And, acceptance of a low bid, clearly, was not in the &quot;best interests&quot; of the State.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of driving while intoxicated after upholding the constitutionality of the law. In pertinent part, the court held that the law was a valid exercise of the state's police power because the legislature reasonably assumed that the public welfare and safety were substantially affected by all intoxicated drivers, and that the requirement of submission to chemical tests would significantly reduce the menace of drunken drivers. In addition, the court rejected defendant's argument that the law was unconstitutional because it compelled defendant to give evidence against himself in violation of his privilege against self-incrimination. Instead, the court held that the law did not violate the privilege within the meaning of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.

The trial court barred the reporters from further attendance at the murder trial and found them in contempt of its order. On appeal, the court reversed. The judiciary could not suppress, edit, or censor from the public those events that occurred in open court proceedings. The trial court's order was void and could not support the contempt convictions of the reporters who violated the order. The trial court's limitation of the reporters' liberty to write and publish an account of those things that occurred in open court was not supported by a different constitutional right that required the limitation. The jury could have been sequestered during the trial. Further, the trial court admonished the jury not to read, view or listen to any news media report on crime or criminal sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An ordinance was adopted increasing the minimum residential lot size to 14,520 square feet. At the same time, the town adopted an ordinance setting forth variance procedures. The property owner reduced his holdings to a tract containing between 28,000 and 29,000 square feet, which was barely insufficient for division into two conforming building sites. The town moved for dismissal of the owner's action on the grounds that the owner had not applied for a variance as to his property. The trial court accepted the owner's argument that he was not compelled to seek administrative relief from what was alleged to be a void legislative enactment. The court reversed. There was nothing in the ordinance to indicate that one who sought a variance thereby admitted the validity of the zoning ordinance in question. Nor was there any inherent repugnancy or inconsistency between a request for a variance and an attack on the zoning ordinance itself. The property owner had available to him the procedures for seeking a variance. Until he had pursued that remedy, the court could not say that he had standing as a party injured by the zoning ordinances that he sought to attack in the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court for Spokane County, Washington, which convicted him on two counts of vagrancy in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.87.010(7) and 9.87.010(13). Defendant claimed that the statute was void for vagueness and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for selling newspapers on a college campus. Defendant's actions were contrary to university regulations that required such persons to register with the Dean's office, and required sales to be conducted through the college book store. Defendant was convicted on two counts of vagrancy pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.87.010(7), which prohibited lewd, disorderly, or dissolute conduct, and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.87.010(13), which prohibited unauthorized activities on school grounds. The court held that the statute was constitutional, based on a decision in a prior case. The court reversed the conviction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.87.010(7), however, because there was no evidence that defendant's conduct was disorderly in any way. The court also expressed doubt that a single act could support two counts of vagrancy, even if the statute was violated in two of 13 possible ways. The court held that there was no showing that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's waiver of a jury trial and no showing that he was prejudiced thereby. Defendant's challenge to the rule making procedure was not considered because it had not been raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and sentence as to the charge of vagrancy involving being unlawfully on school property. The court reversed the judgment and sentence with respect to the charge of vagrancy based on disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The protestors had entered the principal's office at a local high school, refused to leave when requested, remained there for several hours, and committed physical damage to the office and its furnishings. The protestors argued that &sect; 9.27.060 was unconstitutional because it was vague, indefinite, and uncertain and because it attempted to override and deprive them of their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and to peaceably assemble. The court reversed the judgment. The court found that the expressions &quot;breach of the peace,&quot; &quot;disturbance of the peace or the public peace,&quot; &quot;riotous assemblage,&quot; and &quot;disorderly conduct,&quot; as used in &sect; 9.27.060 conveyed the legislative intention with sufficient clarity that a person of ordinary understanding should have readily comprehended what was meant by them. The court opined that &sect;&sect; 9.27.060(2), (3) did not purport to and did not operate to abridge, limit, or vitiate any rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution or the Washington Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agreement was negotiated under Wash. Rev.

One private company was to operate the facility, but the annual operating budget was to be approved by 75 percent of the ownership. After a set date, each owner would be able to draw out its proportionate share of power generated by the facility. The court held that Section 54.44 did not violate Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7, which prohibited a public agency from either lending money or credit to a private entity; or becoming the owner of a private entity's stocks or bonds. The agreement was not a loan of public money or credit to a private entity.

The bureau argued that the trial court's ruling completely abrogated the system employed by the city and maintained that the constitutional rights of respondent were accommodated in that pretrial liberty was secured in lieu of confinement. The court affirmed the part of the trial court's order which held that the statutes were unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt and that the bureau was permanently enjoined from requiring a person cited for a traffic offense and released by a peace officer to post a sum of money prior to obtaining a trial date for that offense. The court reversed the part of the order requiring respondent to stand trial on the charge, dismissing the charge because his right to a speedy trial was violated.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the 60 percent approval requirement did not violate the equal protection clause. The court held that amendment XVII had no classification of voters. The court held that no one was excluded from voting because of lack of some qualification. The court held that if there was a classification by requiring a 60 percent majority, it was a choice made by the voter himself in voting for or against the particular proposition, it was not the result of a discrimination established by the amendment.The court held that there was a rational basis for the 60 percent requirement and that its purpose was directed to a constitutionally permissible end.

The conviction was affirmed and he petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus, setting aside the verdict and sentence of death. The court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. At petitioner's trial, eight prospective jurors were excused because of their reservations concerning capital punishment. The court held that it was error to excuse the prospective jurors without first inquiring into whether their opposition to the death penalty would preclude them from imposing the penalty under any circumstances or would prevent them from making an impartial determination of guilt. The fact that the prosecutor did not utilize any peremptory challenges was not sufficient to prevent vacation of the sentence. Because the prospective jurors were excused at the state's bequest and a Supreme Court decision concerning the disqualification of such jurors had not been disseminated at the time of trial, the court held that petitioner's failure to object to the dismissals did not negate his constitutional guarantees. The court refused to remand for a hearing regarding the excused juror's views at the time of trial.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that once the charges against defendant were filed in the trial court, the justice court had no authority to issue an ex parte order releasing defendant's psychiatric report to the prosecutor. However, dismissal of the charges was not warranted because the report was not introduced at trial and no nexus existed between the prosecutor's misconduct and defendant's rights. Further, because the New Mexico check stop was valid, defendant's confession was not subject the exclusionary rule.

On appeal, the court stated that the even if the travel agencies activities constituted interstate commerce, the tax imposed on those activities was valid and not unconstitutional because it was nondiscriminatory and did not create a multiple burden. The court stated that the tax was not discriminatory because the State was merely requiring the commerce to pay its own way and that was a permissible objective.

The court stated that the constitution contained no prohibition against reimbursement of reasonable and necessary expenses actually incurred and vouchered for by a legislator while away from his place of residence and in attendance upon a legislative session at the seat of government. Further, &quot;compensation,&quot; as utilized in Wash. Const. art. 28, &sect; 1, did not embrace nor include reimbursement for expenses incurred for subsistence and lodging by legislators attending a legislative session away from their place of residence. A flat per diem allowance in lieu of subsistence and lodging expenses, as opposed to reimbursement for actual expenses incurred, did not constitute &quot;compensation&quot; within the meaning of Const. art. 28, &sect; 1, which prohibited increases in compensation to certain state officers during a term of office, where the lump sum payment bore a realistic and proportional relationship to reasonable daily subsistence and lodging expenses necessarily incurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the appeal was pending, the state legislature amended the NDA to provide that cannabis, commonly known as marijuana, was not a narcotic drug.

In so ruling, the court noted that the words employed by the legislature &quot;shall not ever be applicable&quot; evinced its intent, as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.01.040, that the amendment be applied to all pending cases. In further support of its conclusion as to the legislature's intent, the court noted that the current, generally known factors concerning the nature of cannabis revealed that it never possessed the properties of a narcotic drug. Also, the state of the law at the time of the amendment was in conflict. Indeed, the prosecutor could have just as easily charged defendants under the Dangerous Drug Act, Wash. Rev.

The court held that there was no evidence that such consent was necessary. The leasing company failed to demonstrate that the written consent of the established sublicensee was a prerequisite to the transfer of location sublicenses. This failure was not excused by a bare assertion that an effort to obtain the city's approval without such consent would have been futile. No prima facie case had been established.

On appeal, the court held that the parolee knew that his parole was conditioned upon his surrender to federal authorities for the exercise of federal jurisdiction. The court found that he accepted parole with knowledge that this was among the conditions and so long as the maximum state sentence had not expired his parole status while in federal custodia legis disturbed neither the legal operation nor the force of a subsisting state judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the father was the father of the illegitimate child and ordered the father to pay $ 100 a month for child support. Thereafter, the mother of the child filed a petition in the filiation proceeding to increase the support payments. After the father challenged the trial court's jurisdiction and the right of the mother to petition for modification of the trial court's prior child support order, the state joined the mother in her petition. The trial court found a substantial change in conditions and ordered an increase in the father's child support payments to $ 165 a month. The court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to modify filiation child support orders, because the mere absence of an explicit statutory provision for child support modification did not foreclose the trial court from updating child support orders to reflect changing realities. The legislative purpose behind Washington's filiation statutes was to provide paternal support of illegitimate children.</SPAN></P>

The court held, therefore, that the prosecuting attorney could not have elected to proceed against defendants under any statute other than Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.47.060. Defendants were not denied equal protection of the law. The court held that the trial court did not err when it refused to give an instruction on entrapment. The evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that defendants were not persuaded or induced by an officer to do anything they were not in the practice of doing. There was no evidence of entrapment to go to the jury. The officer did no more than afford defendants an opportunity to commit the crime. Such not entrapment.

All the statute did was provide for an award of a reasonable attorney fee and some of the costs of suit actually incurred under prescribed conditions where the law previously allowed no recovery. The owner of condemned land was entitled to just compensation under the Constitution of the State of Washington before he had to surrender possession.

Over one year later, the minor commenced this action against the district alleging that the district's negligence caused her injury. The trial court dismissed the minor's action because the minor failed to present her claim for damages to the district within one year of the date the injury was sustained as required by &sect; 53.52.020. On appeal, the court held that compliance with Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 53.52.010 and 53.52.020 was mandatory and constituted a condition precedent to maintaining an action by the minor for damages for injuries sustained as a result of the district's negligence. The functions of the district were mainly governmental, and it was not liable at common law for injuries resulting from negligence in the operation of its schools. Because the minor's action was dependent upon statutory enactments and because a right existed only by virtue of a statute, the right to maintain the action was subject to such conditions as the legislature imposed. Finally, the requirement that a claim had to be filed within a limited period was applicable to the minor because the legislature did not relax this requirement.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, held that the resolution was constitutional, and found that: (1) employment agencies were subject to police power regulations because the rates charged could become abusive and regulating the maximum rates was substantially directed toward curbing the abuse; and (2) applying a four-factor test, such exercise of police power was judicially reasonable, and the rates set by the resolution were not unreasonable or unnecessarily prohibitory because there was no debilitative effect on employment agencies.</SPAN></P>

The court did not err in denying the motion for a directed verdict. Defendant waived his assignment of error to the admission into evidence of photographs, which showed the victim's body and the interior of her home as discovered by the police. The court found no systematic exclusion of veniremen in the trial court's mistaken rephrasing of a question to one prospective juror who had been present during the proper examination of numerous prior veniremen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington) that denied them a property tax refund and that ordered corrected appraisal practices. Defendants, counties and their treasurers and appraisers, filed a cross-appeal. Third-party defendant Director of the Department of Revenue sought a writ of prohibition to stop proceedings on the complaint of third-party plaintiff, one of the counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers lived in two counties. They alleged that the counties' property taxes were not uniform between them. The assessors contended that their staffs, due to budget constraints, could not annually inspect and re-evaluate parcels. Though the counties listed reassessed valuations currently, one of the counties revalued properties on a six to seven-year cycle, and the other on a four-year cycle. Some of the taxpayers lived in a bi-county school district. The assessment ratio difference between the counties there was about five percent. The court modified and affirmed the judgment. It was proper to require that the assessment ratios be increased to the 50 percent of true and fair value stipulated in Wash. Const. art. 7, &sect; 2, because the provision was mandatory. It was proper to deny the tax refund claim because under the facts, the assessors had not intentionally discriminated, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, or perpetrated constructive fraud. In addition, the assessor's actions did not lead to valuations that were grossly unequal or deprive the taxpayers of substantial rights. Assessments were not void where one of the assessors employed the &quot;long run value&quot; approach.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by denying the Director's writ of prohibition. The court then affirmed the judgment to the extent that the judgment required that the counties' assessment ratios be increased to 50 percent, and denied the tax refund sought by the taxpayers. The court ordered that the Department of Revenue was to assure statewide compliance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in giving an aiding and abetting instruction the jury because he was charged alone, because it constituted an improper and unconstitutional variance from the allegations of the information, and because the evidence did not warrant giving the instruction. The court observed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.01.030 provided that every person concerned in the commission of a felony, gross misdemeanor, or misdemeanor, whether he directly committed the act constituting the offense, or aided and abetted in its commission, and whether present or absent, was a principal. The court could not see how the information against defendant, framed in the salient facts of the charge of robbery, could have misinformed him of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. In view of &sect; 9.01.030, it was not error for the trial court to give the aiding and abetting instruction. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's conclusion that defendant aided and abetted in the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney general, citing U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12, art. 2, &sect; 1, art. 4, &sect; 6, sought a writ of mandamus against defendant Director of the Washington State Department of Institutions directing him to cease and desist from taking any further action in the administration and enforcement of any of the provisions of 1967 Wash. Laws ch. 141, &sect;&sect; 2, 4, 6(1), 12, codified at Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 72.33.650-72.33.700.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutory amendment imposed liability for per capita costs on the estates of mentally or physically deficient persons admitted to state residential schools. The attorney general contended that the amendment failed to provide equal protection, constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power, and improperly appointed the attorney general guardian of the estates. The court granted the writ in part and denied it in part. The court held that 1967 Wash. Laws ch. 141, &sect;&sect; 2, 4, 12 were reasonable classifications of persons and estates and were not in violation of Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12 or the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that the legislature had not unlawfully delegated its authority under Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1. The court noted that the power to appoint a guardian for an incompetent was vested exclusively in the superior court and determined that the guardianship provision, 1967 Wash. Laws ch. 141, &sect; 6(1), violated Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 6. The court held that 1967 Wash. Laws ch. 141, &sect; 6(1) could be severed from the remainder of the act and that the purpose and intent of the act could be wholly achieved without the section or portion thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the attorney general the requested writ of mandamus to prohibit the Director from enforcing the provisions of the statutory amendment except as to the section appointing the attorney general guardian of the residents' estates and granted a writ of mandamus prohibiting the Director from carrying out the provisions of that section.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted Tacoma, Wash., Ordinance No. 17926, which gave a preferential right to renew a fireworks permit to those who held a permit in the preceding year. The wholesaler attacked the constitutionality of the ordinance as being in violation of Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11, as well as in violation of the equal protection clauses of both the state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court noted that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.22.280(23), the city had express authority to &quot;regulate and restrain the use of fireworks.&quot; It also had the power in its discretion to grant or deny an application for a retail permit subject to reasonable conditions. The court held that demonstrated qualifications, concern for safety, obedience to rules and regulations concerning the care, and manifested skill and ability as operators in this particularly sensitive field of business were all matters of unusual importance that were entitled to special consideration. The classification established by the city in its regulation of fireworks had a reasonable and rational relationship toward preserving the public health and safety of the community.</SPAN></P>

The city, although acting in a proprietary capacity when accepting advertising for its transit system, was within the ambit of constitutional guarantees and was thereby bound by said guarantees. There was no substantial showing in the record of a clear and present danger caused by the display of the posters; thus, defendants' actions were unconstitutional as clear acts of censorship in violation of the church's right to free expression as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as the Washington Constitution and denied the plaintiff the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Washington Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had counsel in Canada and again when he returned to this country. The court also held that an accused was able to validly consent to be questioned even after he expressed the wish for counsel, so long as counsel was provided. The court also ruled that defendant was repeatedly warned about his rights and that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent.

Affirming, the court said that it was not shown, nor did defendant contend, that a delay was purposeful, arbitrary, vexatious, or designed by the State to oppress him. The State did nothing to cause or procure a delay in trial or to disparage defendant's opportunity to wage his defense. Nor did the record show a purposeful delay on the State's part or indicate any improper motivation by the prosecution to effect a delay. Defendant could not claim that the delay caused him protracted imprisonment. At all times since his initial arrest, defendant was on bail. He could not argue that he was imprisoned without due process of law or unlawfully confined without judicial process. Affirming for a statutory claim, the court said that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to dismiss with prejudice. Wash. Rev.

XVIII, which limited the use of certain fees and taxes to highway purposes. The director appealed, asserting that the planning of a public transportation system served a &quot;highway purpose.&quot; The court affirmed, holding that the constitutional provision was free of ambiguity. Giving the terms their common meaning, they provided that the revenues derived from motor vehicle licenses and excise taxes on fuel were to be paid into a special fund to be used exclusively for highway purposes. The fact that providing public transportation reduced the wear on highways did not create a &quot;highway purpose.&quot; The state constitution listed the purposes for which the motor vehicle fund could be used, and diverting traffic from the highways was not one of them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parolee's allegation was predicated upon his contention that the revocation hearing procedures employed by the board denied due process of law to parolees. Although the parolee had been informally advised of the nature of the alleged parole violations at the time of his arrest, he was not formally notified of the specific allegations or the board's determination to hold a revocation hearing until after the filing of his petition in the superior court. The court held that the function of a writ of habeas corpus was to inquire into the legality of the particular restraint then being imposed upon a petitioner. It was not to inquire into the validity of some future restraint that might or might not be imposed. The parolee's parole had not been revoked. No revocation hearing had been held. To pass upon procedures that might or might not invade his rights would have been premature and would have fallen into the category of an advisory opinion.</SPAN></P>

When defendant was subsequently searched, two cigarettes were found. Upon analysis, the contents of the bag and the cigarettes were determined to be marijuana. On appeal, defendant alleged that misconduct by the deputy prosecutor resulted in the denial of a fair trial. Defendant further contended that his prior conviction was inadmissible because it was too remote in time, and that his retained counsel was incompetent. The court affirmed, holding that the prosecutor's reference to a &quot;hippie movement&quot; and to the growing marijuana problem in the state during voir dire did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, that the jury was properly instructed that proof of defendant's prior conviction could be considered only in the determination of the weight or credibility of his testimony, and that the record did not support a claim of incompetence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant placed a &quot;mobile&quot; home on the lot. The mobile home's tongue, axles, and wheels were removed, and the home was placed on a permanent concrete-block foundation. She was convicted of the unlawful habitation of a mobile home in violation of Resolution 18801. In reversing the conviction and remanding, the court found that defendant's home was a single family dwelling in compliance with the code. The State contended that defendant lived in a prohibited immobilized vehicle, but defendant's home was not a vehicle. Whatever features of mobility the home originally had, the mobility was of the home itself. The court concluded that defendant's home was a prefabricated one-family-dwelling unit that was not prohibited upon the land in question.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that trial court erred in denying permission to cross-examine a male juvenile witness as to prior acts of unchastity, in commenting on the evidence, and on other evidentiary rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 22-year-old woman was convicted of having sexual intercourse with three 17-year-old males who at the time were in the custody of the juvenile authorities, a charge she consistently denied. The juveniles plus another 16-year-old boy were the only witnesses against defendant and there was a complete lack of physical or independent corroborative evidence other than the testimony of the boys. On review the court held that the trial rested entirely on the jury's assessment of the witnesses' and defendant's credibility. Because of that, two errors of the trial court had to be presumed highly prejudicial and thus were reversible error. First, the trial judge made a negative comment in open court about the &quot;materiality&quot; of defendant's testimony in violation of Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 16. Despite a corrective instruction to the jury, the court considered the harm incapable of being cured. Second, the prosecution's cross-examination about defendant's huge phone bill was beyond the scope of her direct examination, was not relevant to the issues, yet reflected negatively on the character of defendant. The court held that the cumulative effect of the errors deprived defendant of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendants asserted various challenges to the conduct of their trial. The court found that defendants were not denied their right to a preliminary hearing where they sought one in order to gain access to the evidence which the prosecutor had against them. The court further found that defendants failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from denial of their motion to produce. In addition, the trial judge properly overruled the challenge to the jury panel, as there was no evidence defendants were prejudiced by any irregularity in the empanelling procedure. The trial judge also correctly refused to permit one defendant to call the other to the stand for the purpose of requiring him to claim the privilege against self-incrimination. The court then found no error as to the evidentiary rulings, the jury instructions, or any alleged prosecutorial misconduct. The court concluded that the various challenges to the constitutionality of the death penalty were meritless and affirmed, noting that the trial judge properly sustained the prosecutor's challenges for cause as to prospective jurors who stated that they could not in any event vote to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The architect filed a libel action in federal district court against the publisher, which was a Massachusetts corporation maintaining its editorial, circulation, and advertising offices in Boston. The publisher had no employees, property, shareholders, or license to do business in Washington. The publisher's sole contact with Washington was circulation of its magazine through paid subscriptions and newsstand sales. The publisher filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of in personam jurisdiction. The architect countered that jurisdiction was acquired by the service of process under &sect; 4.28.185. The federal district court denied the publisher's motion to dismiss and certified the question of whether Washington had jurisdiction over the publisher. The court answered the question in the affirmative. The architect's claimed damages were suffered within Washington as a result of an alleged tortious act occurring within the state, which fell within the in personam jurisdiction provided by &sect; 4.28.185. The architect was a resident of Washington and his principal place of business was within the state. Thus, the occurrence of the alleged tortious act of libel was within Washington.</SPAN></P>

The court found the statute was permissive, rather than mandatory, and that it did not impose onerous and unconstitutional dictates upon the court. The court further found that the statute did not call for the rendering of an advisory opinion. As to the certified question, the court concluded that a life insurance policy naming a beneficiary protected under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dairy marketed a product in milk containers as a natural milk alternative and sued for a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The State moved to impose an embargo under the Uniform Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.04. The trial court restrained the embargo, held Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 15.38.020(1) of the Act invalid, and permanently enjoined the State. The State appealed. The court reversed. The Act's purpose was to prevent deception and fraud upon the public, which was constitutionally sound. The Act was narrowly tailored to meet that objective because it only prohibited the making and marketing of the product so as to resemble a dairy product. The Federal Filled Milk Act, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 61-64, which was substantially identical, was compatible with due process. The limited prohibition in the Act was constitutional. Although it was not harmful, the product fell within the scope of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.04.220 as an adulterated product. The dairy was free to sell the product but not as an imitation dairy product, or to prove a product was not an imitation dairy product.

The court found that it was limited to the prior restraint and procedural aspects of the ordinances and that those aspects of the ordinances were unconstitutional. The court found the city could impose a prior restraint based on the utterance of obscenity, but it could not impose it by establishing a board to review that would classify and regulate the material without providing for a judicial determination in an adversary proceeding before a particular item could be banned.

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that &sect; 9.19.050 was not unconstitutionally vague because men of ordinary understanding or common intelligence could understand its meaning and would not differ as to its application. The items taken from the automobile were not the fruits of an unreasonable or invalid search because the officer had seen the driver of the car commit a serious misdemeanor and the tools were in plain sight in the back seat of the car. Any issues not raised in the court below could not have been raised on appeal. There was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction because &quot;possession&quot; as used in &sect; 9.19.050 did not turn on ownership of the items.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another allegedly broke into a supermarket and forced the employees into the store's walk-in produce cooler at gunpoint. Shortly thereafter, the assistant manager emerged from upstairs carrying a parcel of cash and checks and he too was forced into the cooler. When the employees broke out of the cooler, they discovered that the safe and the cash registers had been cleaned out, and that the parcel of cash and checks carried by the assistant manager was gone. Defendant was identified in a police lineup, and a jury found him guilty of armed robbery from which he appealed. Defendant contended that certain aspects of the elements of armed robbery were established by mere circumstantial evidence and as a result the proof was deficient in several respects. The court determined that the assistant manager's recitation of the incident, which included having a gun held to his stomach and forced into a walk-in cooler, established a prima facie case of armed robbery in that he was put in fear of violence to his person and that the taking of the parcel of cash and checks he was carrying constituted the taking of something of value from his person or in his presence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the taxpayer and the United States, sought review of the decision from the Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington), which upheld respondent State's assessment of use taxes and penalties against the taxpayer. The taxpayer contended that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.12.020 did not apply to its use of tools belonging to the United States and that the statute, as applied by the state tax commission, denied it equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer used tools belonging to the United States without charge in performing its contract with the government. The tax commission assessed use taxes on the value of the tools. The taxpayer claimed it did not have exclusive control of the tools and thus did not use them under bailment. The trial court sustained the tax commission's assessment. On appeal, the court held that: (1) although the bailment was terminable at will and the government could direct how the tools were used, the tools were within the taxpayer's exclusive &quot;possession&quot;; (2) neither Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.12.020 nor the tax commission's rules required that before a use tax could be imposed, the tax commission had to show that the taxpayer had exclusive &quot;control&quot; of the tools; and (3) the presence of a monetary consideration in the case of a lease and its absence in the case of a bailment was a sufficient distinction to sustain the validity of a use tax on the rentals charged in the case of leased property and on the value of the article in the case of bailed property, and thus, the taxpayer was not denied equal protection. However, the trial court erred in holding that the State was not entitled to interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision from the trial court insofar as it upheld the State's assessment of use taxes and penalties against the taxpayer.

Laws ch. 174.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapter 174 was enacted as a way to freeze the total dollar amount that the taxing districts could levy in a year without a vote by the people at a general election. The taxing districts levied the maximum amount without a vote at a general election, ignoring the mandates of chapter 174. The taxpayers challenged the action of the taxing districts. In their appeal, the taxing districts alleged that chapter 174 was unconstitutional. The taxpayers filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as moot on the ground that chapter 174 was later amended by 1967 Wash. Laws ch. 146, but later urged the court to render a decision on the merits. Dismissing the appeal as moot, the court held that chapter 146 was an effort by the legislature to correct the deficiencies in 1967 Wash. Laws ch. 174 upon which the taxing districts relied to support their position that chapter 174 was unconstitutional. The court found that although the court was able to retain jurisdiction over a case involving a purely academic question, dismissal was proper where the case involved constitutional questions to a statute that had been rewritten.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court imposed a suspended sentence conditioned upon defendant serving four-and-one-half months in the county jail and meeting specified money requirements. Defendant contended that the evidence adduced at his trial was insufficient to support various findings of fact and conclusions of law and that his initial trial counsel did not properly prepare and present his defense, depriving him of a fair trial and due process of law. On appeal, the court held that although the State had the burden of establishing willfulness as well as the absence of lawful excuse in the prosecution for the omission of support proscribed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.20.030(1)(b), it met that burden on a prima facie basis under the provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.20.080. The evidence presented revealed, directly or circumstantially, a failure on the part of the physically or vocationally able parent to furnish the requisites of support. Defendant's assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel failed upon a showing that the trial court praised his counsel for making as fine a record from the standpoint of the defense as could have possibly been accomplished.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in permitting his former wife to testify under a newly-created exception to the spousal privilege, as provided in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 60.060(1). The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Noting that &sect; 60.060(1), permitting spousal testimony relating to violence against a child of the couple, was amended after the crime was committed but before the information was filed, the court found no violation of constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws. Next, the court found that defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly-discovered evidence because the alleged new evidence, pertaining to the former wife's credibility, was known to defendant at the time of trial and was, in any case, impeachment evidence only.</SPAN></P>

There was evidence to show that the police were acting in good faith in impounding defendant's car, and that the search was made for the purposes of protecting its contents from undue risk and the police and the bailee from claims of theft. The court held that the search of the automobile was not illegal when a police officer, following a routine inventory procedure, made a search of an automobile which would have to be impounded and removed from the streets on account of the detention of the owner. The state called a young woman passenger as a witness and she testified to ungentlemanly behavior by defendant.

The lower court denied the requests. Petitioner sought review, contending that the denial of her request for a trial by jury was error. The court rejected this contention, finding that the applicable statute specifically provided that all cases within the jurisdiction of superior courts under the juvenile court act were to be tried without a jury. The court noted that case law affirmed the proposition that proceedings in a juvenile court were not criminal in nature and that the constitutionality of juvenile court proceedings without a jury had been sustained.

Plaintiff was having a house moved, and the planned route, for which the city had issued a permit, included crossing defendant's property. Neither plaintiff nor the mover realized that the route lay across private property. Once the house was on defendant's property, for which he guided the way and removed obstacles, its path was blocked by defendant. He informed the mover that he would not permit it to go any further unless he was paid the $ 650 he claimed plaintiff owed him. After plaintiff obtained a temporary restraining order, the trial court found defendant in contempt. Defendant argued the order was not lawfully entered because its terms were so vague and indefinite and that the order was an unconstitutional taking of his property under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16. The court held that the order was clear and that because defendant invited plaintiff to move the house across the property and plaintiff incurred costs in reliance thereon, it was inequitable for defendant not to allow the house to pass across the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was treated by a psychiatrist at a state institution, two members of a sanity commission reported to the trial court that defendant was then sane, appreciated his peril in connection with pending criminal charges, and was capable of rationally assisting in his own defense. At a second pretrial proceeding, the trial court adopted the commission's conclusion. Defendant was then arraigned and pled not guilty. At his hearing, defendant was represented by court-appointed counsel. Counsel, over defendant's objection, interposed a special plea that defendant was not guilty by reason of insanity at the time the crime was committed. Defendant appealed, alleging that he was denied his constitutional right to act as his own counsel. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that defendant's right to self-representation under the Sixth Amendment was not absolute because other constitutional liberties would be overridden by an absolute right to self-representation in defendant's case. The court concluded that defendant was incompetent to conduct his own defense, and therefore, in the interest of justice, appointment of counsel was necessary.</SPAN></P>

The petition showed that the secretary formally rejected the proposed initiative measure for filing, and declined to give it a serial number on the grounds that the initiative was unconstitutional. The court granted issuance of the writ of mandamus because the secretary did not have discretion to refuse to file, give a serial number, or refuse to transmit a numbered copy of the proposed initiative measure to the State pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code. &sect; 29.79.020 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.79.030. The court reasoned that the secretary had the ministerial duty to perform the series of official acts regarding proposed initiative measures.

The city appealed. The court reversed the judgment of the superior court. The court held that under Wash. Rev.

Const. art. 11, &sect; 11, giving general powers to cities, the city was empowered to regulate the collection and disposition of inorganic refuse.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner was a party to an unexercised lease-option. The county auditor refused to record a memorandum of the agreement until the property owner satisfied the 1 percent excise tax on real-estate transactions under King County Resolution 29779 (the resolution). The owner brought an action seeking a judicial determination that the resolution, pursuant to the statute, did not apply to unexercised lease-options. The court found that there was no constitutional inhibition to the legislative classification of an option-lease as a property interest transfer subject to the tax imposed by the statute. The court determined that the imposition of the tax on the option-lease was not a denial of due process and equal protection of the law because the classification was a rational means to accomplish the legislative purpose of closing loopholes in the scheme of excise taxation. The court found that the resolution as administered was inconsistent with the statute because whether or not it would be inequitable to collect the tax had not been properly determined. The court held that the owner was entitled to have the lease recorded and have the tax deferred until the option was exercised.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asked the girl to go with him to his office and demurred about her first calling her mother. Defendant and the girl left in his automobile.

Defendant was tried de novo by the superior court sitting without a jury. Defendant appealed his conviction and urged that he was helpless to avoid violating the ordinance because of his addiction to alcohol. Defendant appealed his conviction on the ground that he was a chronic addictive alcoholic; that he was thus suffering from a disease that rendered him powerless to avoid violating the ordinance; that he was convicted not of an offense but rather of suffering from a condition or being of a status; that his conviction of drunkenness violated U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14, forbidding cruel punishments, and the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the city ordinance against public drunkenness was a constitutional exercise of the police power applicable to chronic addictive alcoholics.

The court held that the tax did not represent state legislation on the subject of Indian trading, but rather upon the subject of the wholesale distribution activities carried on wholly outside of any Indian reservation. The court concluded that the tax complained of was not such a burden upon commerce with the Indian tribes as to have violated U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3 where the incidence of the tax occurred outside of any Indian reservation and prior to the entry of the cigarettes into Indian commerce and its effect upon the Indian tribe was too indirect and remote to render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by the justice court of negligent homicide and another charge. He was found guilty of the second count and the justice court found that there was sufficient evidence to bind him over for trial in superior court on the negligent-homicide count. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment on that charge. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that the justice court, in which defendant first appeared on the charge of negligent homicide, was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the charge on its merits under Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 10, amendment 28. Defendant, not having been once in jeopardy before a court of competent jurisdiction, was not unconstitutionally placed in jeopardy by his trial in the superior court. Defendant waived his right to assign error based on the prosecutor's original demand for the production of a document by defendant where he used the statement for his own purposes. A statement by the prosecutor did not constitute a clear expression of personal opinion, and the admonition of the superior court cured any prejudice from the remark.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to their convictions, defendants argued that their rights to have counsel present during their interrogations were violated. The court first noted that Miranda rules were not applicable to the case at issue because defendants' case came to trial prior to the establishment of the Miranda caselaw. In affirming defendants' convictions and sentences, the court applied pre-Miranda caselaw and concluded that evidence established that defendants had been adequately apprised of their rights to counsel and to remain silent and had waived such rights prior to giving their statements. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the trial court did not err in finding that police had not heard requests for an attorney by one defendant because they were unintelligible, and thus, the officers' further questioning of the defendant was not improper. Additionally, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendants' motions for separate trials. The court also held that the trial court properly excused potential jurors for cause because they demonstrated that they were not in favor of the state's death penalty law.</SPAN></P>

The contesting voters filed an action to restrain the annexing city and its officials from certifying the results of the annexation election.

On appeal, the court found the legal description of the proposed annexed territory was adequate, and the proposed area was contiguous to the annexing city. Next, the court did not find any error on the date the annexation election was held because an emergency was not a prerequisite for the special annexation election. Finally, the court found the notice by publication two-days later than what was first stated did not defeat the validity of the annexation election.

The taxpayer challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the transit commission was unlawfully managing and operating the transportation system of the city, and that he had been damaged by the resulting unlawful expenditure of public funds for this purpose. After both parties moved for summary judgment, the trial court entered a summary judgment of dismissal. The court affirmed, holding that the provision of the city charter allowing the transit commission to operate the transportation system was not unconstitutional. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the charter was contrary to the provision of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.92.060. The court found that the statute did not grant authority to run the transportation system only to the legislative authority of the city, as claimed by the taxpayer, but clearly granted authority to cities and towns in their corporate capacity. The authority to operate the system, and consequently to determine the method of operation, was vested in the city in its corporate capacity. Therefore there was no conflict between the city charter placing the authority to operate the city's transportation system in the transit commission and the provisions of &sect; 35.92.060.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign corporation paid business and occupation taxes imposed by the city under protest. The parties stipulated that over 88 percent of the products manufactured by the corporation, at a plant outside of the city, were delivered to ultimate destinations outside the city without the prior knowledge of anyone in the office in the city. The city argued that all of the corporation's gross proceeds were attributable to its city-based activities. The trial court found for the corporation, and the court affirmed. The court sustained the corporation's argument that the city's imposition of tax violated the guaranty of equal protection of the laws. The stipulation of facts showed that the city permitted other companies to apportion their gross receipts for the purpose of paying the business and occupation tax. There were no reasonable grounds to distinguish between the foreign corporation and the three exemplars submitted by the agreed statement of facts. The taxation of the privilege of doing business must be confined to a standard within the territorial limits of the city, for the city had no power either to authorize, license, or tax activities beyond its territorial limits.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had granted summary judgment to the corporation largely on the theory that the corporation was an employer of the injured persons under the Washington Industrial Insurance Act and immunized from an action at law for damages. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment, holding that the record disclosed that the requisite consensual relationship of employer-employee did not exist between the injured persons and the corporation. The court held that the corporation exercised no control over the injured persons, as to the manner in which they performed their services; nor did the corporation list the injured persons as its employees under the Industrial Insurance Act or pay their premiums to the accident or medical aid funds.</SPAN></P>

He was acquitted of assaulting the individual but was convicted of assaulting the wife. He received a two year deferred sentence, which was revoked after he attempted suicide. Thereafter, he appealed his conviction, and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Even though the wife was not present at the trial, evidence showed that defendant had quarreled with her in the past and had struck her. It was reasonable for a jury to have inferred that the wife would have been apprehensive of further bodily harm on seeing defendant brandishing a gun pointed at her. The evidence was sufficient to support his conviction. A statement given by defendant to the police was properly admitted where it was freely and voluntarily given and he was warned of his right to counsel before he signed the statement. Failure of the trial judge to include an essential element of the crime within one jury instruction was not error where other instructions covered it.</SPAN></P>

Also, by providing for the submission of additional evidence to the court reviewing an order of appellee, the legislature intended that such additional evidence would relate only to alleged irregularities during proceedings before appellee. The court affirmed rejection of evidence that appellant could have submitted to appellee but chose to withhold until appealing appellee's order.

The court first held that federal habeas corpus jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2241, et seq. was concurrent, rather than exclusive, once the prisoner, who was a state-convicted defendant, initiated federal habeas corpus proceedings. The court also found that the prisoner's allegations raised serious questions of fact as to the denial of his constitutional rights to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued the prisoner's requested writ of habeas corpus and remanded the case to the trial court for a full, factual hearing to allow the prisoner to call witnesses in his behalf and to produce documentary or other evidence in support of his claims of brutality. The court ordered that the case and the record, with findings of fact made and entered by the trial judge, was to be returned to it for a final disposition.</SPAN></P>

The boy agreed, While in defendant's apartment, defendant made indecent proposals to the boy, and the boy agreed. The boy was dropped off. He and his friends were later picked up by the police for car prowling. The boy told the police of the homosexual acts. Defendant was convicted of sodomy. On appeal, the court affirmed. Cross-examination of defendant regarding homosexual pornography in his home was proper, as such evidence corroborated the boy's testimony describing defendant's apartment. The sodomy statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.79.100 was not unconstitutional. The legislature considered the public interest served by it, it was not vague but gave fair notice, and did not violate the establishment clause. Defendant was not denied equal protection even though others were permitted to engage in homosexual acts in public bars and clubs under the supervision and control of the police.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Property owners outside the city limits petitioned the city to extend its water system into their district by means of a local improvement district (LID). The construction of the extended water system was to be paid partly by the property owners in the district and partly out of the city council's water division revenue. The city residents filed an action challenging the city's actions, but the trial court entered a judgment for the city. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, and held that the special assessments imposed by the LID were not taxes under Wash. Const. art. 7, &sect;&sect; 1, 9. Even though it was outside the city, the assessments did not fall within the constitutional mandate prescribing uniformity of taxation. Although the ad valorem taxes on property within the city ultimately went into the LID guaranty fund, these funds were not expended unconstitutionally for the benefit of persons and property outside the city limits because the guaranty fund's liability was contingent and indirect, and the city would own the extended water system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county assessor completed a program of appraising separately each parcel of property in the county. In determining each parcel's assessed valuation the assessor used a ratio factor of 20 percent of the true and fair value for approximately one-half of the county's total assessed value of real estate and 25 percent for the other half of the county's real estate. By reason of the disparity, the Commission issued an assessment equalization order that fixed the ratio of assessed valuation at 20 percent or at a level established by an alternative plan. On appeal, the court held that the Commission properly directed petitioners to assess property uniformly throughout the county in conformity with the 14th amendment to the Washington Constitution. However, the Commission disregarded the mandate of the 17th Amendment and the provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 84.40.030, 84.41.090 requiring that the assessed valuation of all real and personal property be 50 per centum of the true and fair value.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city amended an existing ordinance that reclassified property from a residential zone into a community business zone for the purpose of building a shopping center.

The trial court granted a writ of certiorari filed by respondents and declared the amendatory ordinance null and void. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the city council was not arbitrary in approving the amendment where its decision was based on substantial research prepared by a city planning commission that had carefully analyzed the proposal and its impact on surrounding property owners, and on marketing surveys. The court found that the concomitant agreement was not ultra vires because: (1) the city's requirement that it be reimbursed for costs related to condemnation proceedings for property needed for right-of-ways was within the city's legislative authority; and (2) the agreement only granted the development company its statutory right to file a petition to vacate certain streets, but did not oblige the city to grant such a petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from their convictions for maintaining a public nuisance, defendants contended that the applicable statutory provision, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.66.010, was unconstitutionally vague. Defendants also asserted that the charge of illegally operating a kennel constituted an accusation which did not state a crime. The court affirmed defendants' convictions for maintaining a public nuisance but reversed the convictions for illegally operating a kennel. The count charging defendants with illegally operating a kennel was dismissed. If the wording of a statute criminalizing public nuisances apprised a person of common understanding of the conduct sought to be proscribed, then such statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Section 9.66.010 was sufficiently specific to define a nuisance to persons of ordinary understanding. However, the charge of illegally operating a kennel failed to substantially charge an offense. If a complaint did not at the outset charge a violation of the criminal code, or describe a common-law crime otherwise cognizable by Washington's courts, a verdict of guilty would not convert a non-crime into a crime.</SPAN></P>

The court quashed the writ and held that the Municipal Court Act, which granted the driver a trial before a magistrate only, with a trial de novo on appeal to the trial court, where a jury trial would have been afforded the driver, was not violative of the Washington Constitution. The court also noted that because of the potential penalty faced by the driver, the offenses with which he was charged were &quot;petty,&quot; and therefore, the driver was not entitled to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence presented by the State at trial demonstrated that defendant enticed the victim into a room and deliberately and lewdly exposed his genitals to her. On appeal of his conviction, defendant asserted that &sect; 9.79.080(2) was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Sixth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The court held that &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;obscene&quot; had a commonly recognized usage and a person of ordinary intelligence could have recognized the conduct prohibited by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.79.080(2). Defendant challenged a jury instruction that charged that defendant could be convicted upon the uncorroborated testimony of the victim. The uncorroborated testimony of the infant victim of a sex crime was sufficient for conviction in Washington, if the jury believed the victim. The instruction did not constitute a comment on the evidence by the trial judge under Wash. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The court held that the trial court's failure to qualify the evidentiary standard was a harmless error because the victim's testimony was somewhat corroborated and the jury was amply instructed on the State's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four consolidated cases, defendant seamen appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which entered judgment for plaintiff, the State of Alaska, regarding the State's action for enforcement of payment by the seamen of income taxes alleged to be owed to the State. The suit was initiated under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.140, the reciprocal tax collection statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed suit seeking to collect taxes from income earned by the seamen while they were working aboard ships in the jurisdiction of Alaska. The tax collection was authorized under the Alaska Net Income Tax Act, Alaska Stat. tit. 43. The seamen challenged the action alleging that the Act was an unconstitutional violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as well as a violation of the Commerce Clause. The seamen claimed that the State could not constitutionally levy a tax on the net income of seamen engaged in interstate and foreign commerce. The trial court entered judgment for the State. On appeal, the court found that the Act, as applied to the seamen, did not violate either the Fourteenth Amendment or the Commerce Clause. There was no distinction between business generated by the economic activities of the State which was accountable for the employment of nonresidents whether on land or on the water. The court rejected the seamen's claims that the Act violated the rule requiring a uniform system regulated solely by the federal government in maritime commerce.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 29.82.020 in a proceeding initiated for the officials' recall from office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the officials argued that &sect; 29.82.020, under which the county auditor was given the authority to formulate and issue a ballot synopsis, was unconstitutional because it violated Wash. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1. Specifically, the officials claimed that the formulation and issuance of the ballot synopsis constituted a judicial function, which was vested in the judicial branch under art. 4, &sect; 1. In affirming the trial court's judgments, the court rejected the officials' argument. While Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.82.020 placed the burden on the county auditor to examine the charges in the recall petitions in determining whether they involved acts of misfeasance, malfeasances, or violations of the oath of office, the court noted that the determination was a limited one and was not a final determination of the officials' rights. It was only a step in the procedural process for implementing the recall process under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 33 and 34. The court emphasized that all action taken by the county auditor under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.82.020 was subject to judicial review under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 29.82.160.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A duly elected county commissioner of Kitsap County, Washington, died, thereby creating a vacancy on that board of county commissioners. The remaining county commissioners, being of different political faiths, were unable to agree upon and appoint a successor. The court noted that a board of county commissioners with one vacancy was a legally constituted body capable of carrying out its legal duties with full constitutional authority, by reason of Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 6, and were permitted to appoint a qualified person to fill a vacancy on the board. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.32.070(3) was found unconstitutional, but was re-enacted. However, the court found that the legislative re-enactment did not overcome the constitutional barrier posed by Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 6. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that a political disagreement between the two elected and incumbent county commissioners did not divest them of their constitutional or statutory powers and duties, nor did it create a situation in which the legislature could have delegated to the governor a duty that the constitution required must have been performed by the board of county commissioners.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the statutes did not permit a city or town to divide a continuous local improvement project into units in order to assess the cost of acquisition of rights-of-way against the units from which the rights-of-way were acquired.

The court held that the enactment and enforcement of appellee's disputed ordinances limiting appellant in the exercise of its electrical franchises to a part of the appellee's area constituted an unwarranted and unconstitutional impairment of appellant's franchise and one not to be countenanced as an exercise of the police power to protect the citizenry from the dangers of electrical transmission and distribution. There was no claim that appellant had not or would not comply fully with all state safety regulations and rules or those of appellee pertaining to the generation, transmission, and distribution of electrical energy or the construction and maintenance of all related facilities. Accordingly, holding that the ordinances were unconstitutional and void, the court reversed the trial court's order and vacated the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the members of the state legislature tripled the salaries for the legislators effective at the next session, the question arose as to the eligibility of current members for the increased salary or re-election or both. By resolution, the legislators requested the attorney general to take action to resolve the issues. The attorney general filed the instant action against the county auditors, and several citizens intervened. The trial court entered judgment for the attorney general, and the county auditors and citizens appealed. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the incumbent legislators were not disqualified from filing for re-election when their current terms expired and that all members of the legislature were eligible for the newly enacted salary increase. Eligibility to run for office should be presumed rather than be denied. When the people imposed on the legislature the duty to fix state salaries, they did not intend to erase the legislators' eligibility to stand for re-election. Where a salary increase did not take effect during a current term, legislators were not ineligible to serve at a higher salary commencing with the expiration of the current term.</SPAN></P>

The court held the refusal did not ipso facto constitute an infringement upon his constitutional rights and then concluded the refusal was not during a &quot;critical stage&quot; as there was no confessions, admissions, or incriminating statements elicited from defendant. Defendant's contention that he might have been able to locate witnesses who were allegedly with him on the night of the robbery was only speculative as he did not know where they lived or their last names. The court held defendant's motion for an arrest of judgment was properly refused as the evidence supported his conviction. The court concluded the trial court did not err in giving an instruction as to burglary in the second-degree when it failed to qualify the instruction the breaking and entering into a building or structure was where property was kept for use, sale, or deposit because defendant testified he was at the service station that was robbed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a second lawsuit, the majority shareholders and directors sought to exclude directors-elect from the board of directors after the directors-elect were elected by a minority shareholder group by the use of cumulative voting. The corporation lost the first lawsuit and appealed. The corporation then amended its by-laws to preclude cumulative voting, thereby rendering the first decision moot. The appeals were consolidated and the court reversed the trial court's judgment in the second lawsuit that was in favor of the corporation. The issue was whether Congress intended to incorporate a provision of the Oregon Constitution that existed in 1884 into the law of Alaska as of 1884. That statute did not include a reservation of power to the legislature to amend, alter, or repeal the act under which a corporation was organized. The court held that the act under which the instant corporation was organized did not contain a reservation of power to amend, repeal, or modify, and that the action of the corporation's board of directors in adopting the amended bylaws at issue was without any legislative authority and contrary to the statute under which the corporation was organized.</SPAN></P>

One evening, police noticed his automobile heading away from the street in question. They followed the car to petitioner's apartment. Petitioner and a passenger, appearing unsteady, went up to petitioner's apartment. As an officer approached petitioner's glass door, petitioner came out of the doorway and collided with him. Petitioner could barely walk, and he told the officer that he was &quot;loaded on goofers.&quot; He stuck out his tongue, on which the officer saw a barbiturate. He then arrested petitioner and, through an open door, saw petitioner's companion place something on a shelf. When he entered, the officer found two capsules of heroin on the shelf. The officer arrested the companion, and then returned to the apartment to find another capsule. In denying petitioner's application, the court ruled that the officers had probable cause to suspect the commission of a felony by petitioner. Thus, his warrantless arrest was proper. The search of the apartment was a valid search incident to arrest; thus, the heroin capsules were properly introduced as evidence against petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A union petitioned the personnel board for a determination of a bargaining unit for employees of the liquor control board. The employee, who worked for the liquor control board, objected to unionization and the superior court ruled that the personnel board lacked jurisdiction over liquor control board workers. An injunction was entered barring the personnel board from proceeding with the determination of a bargaining unit. The personnel board appealed. In reversing, the supreme court ruled that the personnel board had jurisdiction over liquor control board workers pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.06.040(2) (1961). Moreover, the employee failed to demonstrate a justiciable controversy, that is, he failed to show that any right or privilege of his would be interfered with by a mere determination of a bargaining unit since there was no showing that he would be included in the unit or forced to unionize. The declaratory judgment act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.04.070, did not provide authority to render advisory opinions. Also, a bargaining unit determination was not per se unconstitutional or violative of the merit system created by Initiative 207, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 41.06.</SPAN></P>

That portion of the ordinance purported to make a defendant responsible even though he in fact might not have been the person responsible for the parking violation. The court held that the remainder of &sect; 21.66.180 established only a prima facie responsibility upon the registered automobile owner, which he had the right to rebut.

A suspicion of a violation of a city ordinance was not a precondition to the inspection. The court stated that the ordinance was valid because the ordinance regulated the inspection of buildings for fire hazards and was within the police power of a municipality.

The words, &quot;contractors,&quot; &quot;registration,&quot; and &quot;penalties&quot; were sufficient notice of the object of ch. 77 reasonably leading to further inquiry into the contents of the act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his two convictions by the Superior Court for King County, Washington, for peddling in King County without a license, a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.71.010 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not challenge the fact that he violated the county peddler's statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.71.010 et seq. However, he claimed that it was improperly enacted and that it was not effective. 1963 Wash. Laws 4 was the Act that contained Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.71.010 et seq., and the Act's title stated that the Act applied to counties and Wash. Rev. Code tit. 36. The title also stated that the Act provided penalties, and it repealed certain acts and parts of acts. The Act itself contained 220 printed pages with an explanatory note that was 33 pages long, and the explanatory note explained any changes in wording that were made to any section. Upon appeal, defendant's convictions were affirmed. The court held that the Act was set up in such a way that any person could find any change in any section within 30 seconds. Thus, the court held that because the Act was a comprehensive revision, the title provided all the notice that was practicable and did not embrace more than one subject. The court also ruled that even if the Act was improperly enacted, it would have had no effect on defendant because the Act merely replaced another act that prohibited peddling in King County.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant City of Yakima sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court for Yakima County (Washington), which rendered summary judgment in favor of respondent voter and ordered the City to hold an election for the purpose of voting upon an initiative ordinance proposed by the voter to repeal ordinances that increased a tax rate and created a tax provision and to allow tax credits for all increased taxes collected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City enacted two ordinances which amended an existing municipal code for the purpose of increasing certain tax rates and adding other tax provisions. The voter proposed an initiative ordinance to repeal the new ordinances and provide a credit for all increased taxes collected. The City sought a declaratory judgment that it was not required to pass the initiative ordinance or submit it to a vote. Prior to trial, the City passed a new ordinance which contained the same provisions as the two prior ordinances and which effectively repealed the prior ordinances. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the voter and ordered that the City submit the initiative ordinance to a vote. On appeal, the court reversed and held that: (1) the question of whether the initiative ordinance should have been submitted to a vote was moot since it referred only to the two ordinances that had already been repealed by the City's subsequent ordinance; (2) the initiative ordinance's provision for a tax credit did not create an existing controversy because such refunds were prohibited by law; and (3) the City could not be required to hold an election since it would have been a useless act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and directed that the case be dismissed. The court ordered that each party was to pay its own costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, by his counsel, admitted that he and his wife were guests at the complaining hotel. The balance owing on defendant's hotel account was $ 186.26. The hotel auditor mailed a statement of the defendant's account addressed to him at the address written by defendant upon his registration, but it was returned unclaimed, bearing the stamp &quot;unknown at this address.&quot; The court affirmed. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.48.110 created a rebuttable presumption that defendant had an intent to defraud the hotel from his departure without payment for his hotel accommodations. No constitutional rights of defendant were impaired by the legislative presumption set out in &sect; 19.48.110. There was a rational connection between the act of a hotel guest in departing without making payment for accommodations received and the intent to defraud. The presumption could be rebutted by facts and circumstance shown without requiring defendant to become a witness in his own behalf. Further, there was no imprisonment for &quot;debt&quot; as prohibited by Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 because imprisonment was for the fraud, not for the debt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave an airman a ride, and during the ride, defendant twice made indecent comments to the airman and followed the comments by touching the airman on the leg. The airman complained, and after being let out of the car, the airman called the police. When questioned by the police, defendant admitted that the accusations of the airman were true, and defendant admitted that he had engaged in similar behavior in the past. At the close of the State's evidence, the trial court dismissed the vagrancy charge against defendant, finding that the State had not produced sufficient evidence. The court reversed, holding that the State's evidence was sufficient. The court ruled that that the two indecent comments, the two touches to the leg, and defendant's admission that he had previously engaged in similar conduct provided enough evidence to convict defendant. The court also ruled that even if there had been only a single act of lewdness, the single act was sufficient to convict defendant of being a vagrant where the single act justified an inference that no one who was not lewd would have engaged in the act even once.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was allowed to inquire into the witness's prior arrests, and the witness testified that he did not know how many times he had been convicted of a crime, but that the most recent conviction had been for illegal possession and consumption. The trial court did not allow defendant to further inquire into the criminal record and ruled that the point had been sufficiently covered. The court affirmed and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in termination the cross-examination of the witness on the subject of his criminal record. The court noted that defendant neither offered to prove nor did he indicate that he had any evidence to show that the witness had been convicted of any offenses not acknowledged or revealed in his previous answers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1961 Wash. Laws 162 authorized the trustees of a library district to form a local improvement district and then, pursuant to 1961 Wash. Laws 162, &sect; 2, to specially assess the landowners to pay for a public library. The court reversed the dismissal of the landowners' complaint that challenged the constitutionality of 1961 Wash. Laws 162. Special assessments for a local public improvement must benefit the specific land assessed to pay for the improvement. The benefit must be actual, physical, and material. The court analogized a public library with a public auditorium and noted that while both contributed to the culture of the community neither attached to nor increased the value of the land adjacent to such public improvement. Consequently, the public library unlike a public road, sewer, or park, did not enhance the landowners' property and therefore the trustees could not specially assess the landowners to pay for the public library.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent brought suit against appellant and sought injunctive relief against the further construction of a state highway, contending that the proximity of the highway to respondent's hospital would have rendered a wing of the hospital unusable. Appellant renewed its challenge to the jurisdiction of the Spokane County trial court, asserting that the suit was actually one against the state, and as such was required to have been brought in Thurston County under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.92.010 and Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 26. The court agreed with appellant and reversed the decision by the trial court in favor of respondent. The court found that the state, being most vitally affected by the permanent injunction, was the real party in interest and the party actually enjoined. The court further ruled that the Superior Court for Spokane County was, therefore, without jurisdiction to hear the cause under the law. The court reasoned that the individual appellants and the Highway Commission as an organ of government comprised the only agents of government charged by law with carrying out the state's highway program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which convicted her of possession of a narcotic without a prescription in violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the prosecutor had the discretion to charge either a felony or a misdemeanor on the same set of facts, and that such discretion was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clauses of U. S. Const. amend. 14 and U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. Upon review, the court found defendant's argument without merit. Illegal possession was potentially much more dangerous to society than illegal use, because the possessor may have dispensed the drugs to others, whereas the user was affecting mainly himself. Of course, the user of narcotics was also oftentimes a possessor. If the prosecutor was able to prove each separate crime, then he could have charged defendant with violations of either or both Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 69.33.230, 69.33.410. Defendant's constitutional right to equal protection of the laws was not violated by the prosecutor's exercising of discretion in deciding to prosecute or not to prosecute violation of a criminal statute. The fact that such discretion extended to two or more crimes did not convert the discretion into an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority or constitute a denial of the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

After receiving numerous objections and holding a meeting for protestants only, the Board withdrew its approval. The owner filed a second application, which was denied.

The Board filed a motion to quash and dismiss, which was granted. On appeal, the court reversed the order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners established a trailer park on their property. Under protest on the grounds that the fee was unreasonable, the owners signed a contract with the City to pay the connection fee assessed by the City under Seattle, Wash., Ordinance 90233 (the Ordinance) in installments. The owners made a small downpayment. In adopting the ordinance, the City established the connection fee based on the cost of installing a different kind of sewer system than the type to which the owner's property was to be connected and did not consider the actual costs involved with connecting to an existing trunk sewer system. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court that the Ordinance was void. The court determined that the Ordinance was not entitled to a presumption of validity because the Ordinance established the connection fee on a basis not provided for by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.40.025. The court found that the connection fee, which was based upon current construction costs, did not represent the owners' equitable share of the cost of an existing system.</SPAN></P>

XIV and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The skating rink operators instituted a suit questioning the validity of 1961 Wash. Laws 24, &sect; 1. That act imposed a tax on admission fees of recreational businesses, including but not limited to golf, pool, billiards, skating, ski lifts and tows, and others, and specifically excluded bowling from the admissions taxes. The trial court found that the section providing the exemption was void because it was a denial of equal protection. The court reversed, finding the exemption of bowling from the tax violated no equal protection principal as to the skating rink operators. It held that there was a strong presumption that a revenue statute was constitutional. In addition, the legislature had very broad discretion in making classifications and that a classification, though discriminatory, was not arbitrary or violative of the equal protection clause if any state of facts could reasonably be conceived that would sustain the classification. The court then held that there was a narrow distinction between skating and bowling, as bowling required a high initial capitalization, its rates were fairly expense, it was often located in local neighborhoods, and was a sport requiring skill.</SPAN></P>

The port district countered that the expenditure for promotional hosting, which included expenditures for meals and entertainment of shippers and businessmen, were not gifts, but rather public purpose expenses, which were necessary to bring in business to the port. The superior court agreed and granted the port district's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions to grant the relief requested by the state. The court held that the port district's expenditures of public funds for the promotion of its port were classified as gifts under the Washington constitution, and therefore, prohibited. The court found that the nature of the expenses was a gift and that the nature was not changed regardless of the purpose for the expenditures. The court noted that no matter how well-intentioned the purpose of the expenditure, such as the generation of business, the fact remained that public funds were not to be used for a private benefit.</SPAN></P>

However, the court determined that once a federal district court acquired jurisdiction of a habeas corpus petition, that jurisdiction was exclusive under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2243. The court held that it had no jurisdiction over the matter alleged because the federal district court still had exclusive jurisdiction over the original habeas corpus petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney general filed an action against several employers alleging that they violated the Washington Minimum Wage Act (Act). The key issue was whether the statutory definition of &quot;wages&quot; permitted the value of meals, laundering of uniforms, and the costs of insurance to be included in calculating wages paid, and in determining whether the minimums provided by the Act had been met. The trial court ruled in favor of the attorney general. On appeal by the employers, the court affirmed and held that the 1961 amendments to the Act, 1961 Wash. Laws ch. 18, &sect; 7, resulted in the definition of &quot;wages&quot; being limited to compensation payable in legal tender of the United States, or checks convertible into cash on demand at full face value, and did not allow deductions from the minimum wage for customary items provided by an employer, such as apparel or lodging. Therefore, the trial court's ruling that uniforms, laundry allowance, health and welfare, and pension contributions could not be considered in calculating wages and thus, in determining compliance with the Act, was not error and was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The corporation paid the assessed amount and then filed an action challenging the legality of a &sect; 82.32.050 provision that allowed for the assessment of interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In prior litigation, the corporation had unsuccessfully challenged its obligation to pay business and occupation taxes. The Commission audited the corporation's books after the corporation's obligation to pay the taxes was upheld; the Commission added six-percent interest to the amount it assessed as provided in &sect; 82.32.050. The corporation filed the action; it did not challenge the principal amount of the deficiency assessed but asserted that the provision in &sect; 82.32.050, which allowed the Commission to assess interest, was unconstitutional. The trial court found that the provision was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and that it denied the corporation's equal protection and due process rights. The court agreed and held that the interest provision constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in violation of Wash. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1. Taxes were not considered to be a debt; no interest could be imposed on them unless specifically provided for by statute. No Washington law required interest to be imposed upon business and occupation delinquencies; the assessment of such interest could not be left to the Commission's sole, unguided discretion.</SPAN></P>

The effect of the trial court's order of dismissal left the parties in a seemingly inconsistent position. The sum of $ 16,500, which the State had deposited in the registry as a continuing tender pursuant to a stipulation, was ordered returned to the State and the property owners were absolutely and completely restrained from interfering with the State's possession of the property. Nothing was said in the order regarding the title to the property which, in the absence of a decree of appropriation, was still vested in the owners. There was a finding that no question remained except the fixing of compensation for the owners, but the order contained no provision for the trial of that issue. The court found that the owners consented to the State's taking possession of their property. After the State had been in possession for nearly three years and had constructed a State office building, the owners moved to dismiss the condemnation proceeding and to restore legal title to them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and with reckless driving. The municipal court judge denied defendant's request for a jury trial. The trial court granted defendant's petition for a writ of prohibition restraining the judge from proceeding to trial without a jury, and the municipal court judge appealed. The court affirmed. From the evidence, the court found that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.50.280, jury trials were allowed in municipal court only in offenses involving the revocation or suspension of a driver's license. The court found that with respect to the DUI case, the record did not show whether defendant had two prior convictions within a five-year period. Three convictions were necessary to support a mandatory revocation. The court held that there was a possible revocation of defendant's license involved. The court found that in the event of a conviction on the reckless driving charge, defendant's license would have to be suspended. The court held that a person charged with driving a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and/or reckless driving was entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35.20.090. The statute provided that no trial by jury should be allowed in criminal cases involving violations of city ordinances. The trial court held the statute was unconstitutional because it denied equal protection of the laws to defendants where jury trials were available for the same type of offenses in other courts. The court reversed and remanded. The court found that the finding was in error inasmuch as jury trials were not allowed in all cases in trials in police courts. Defendants cited authorities sustaining the proposition that legislatures could not deny equal protection of the laws, but none supporting the contention that the law questioned here constituted such a denial. The court held that the right to trial by jury was not denied because defendants had the right to appeal their conviction to a superior court. The court concluded that because defendants had not shown that they were entitled to a trial by jury in the first instance, they had failed to sustain their contention that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retiree pled guilty to a felony and was granted probation under a deferred sentence. The Board deemed the retiree's plea of guilty to be a conviction under &sect; 41.20.110 and ceased the retiree's pension payments. Subsequently, the information against the retiree was ultimately dismissed. The retiree petitioned the Board to retroactively reinstate his pension. The Board refused, and the retiree filed a declaratory action asserting that a deferred sentence coupled with dismissal of the charge did not constitute a felony conviction. The restoration of the retiree's pension was affirmed on appeal. The court found that there was neither an adjudication of guilt nor a sentence, and, consequently, the retiree was not convicted of any felony within the meaning of &sect; 41.20.110. The retiree's entry of a plea of guilty and the granting of probation coupled with a subsequent dismissal of the information did not constitute a conviction under &sect; 41.20.110.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In January 1947, the inmate pleaded guilty to the taking a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner.

In February 1955, the inmate was arrested for being drunk in public and was sentenced to 1 year in jail with 10 months suspended. While incarcerated, his probation in the motor vehicle charge was revoked, and he was sentenced to 20 years. The inmate filed a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that the judgment and sentence, and warrant of commitment in the motor vehicle charge were unconstitutional and void for the reason that the 20-year sentence prescribed by the court exceeded the statutory term prescribed by statute. The State conceded that the sentence of 20 years for taking a motor vehicle without permission of the owner was erroneous; the maximum sentence should have been 10 years. However, even though the term of the sentence was erroneous, the judgment of conviction was not void. Hence, the inmate was not released from confinement but he was resentenced.</SPAN></P>

The court held that under the authority granted by Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with eminent domain proceedings against respondent owner's irrigable land, appellant State of Washington sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court for Kittitas County, Washington, which awarded respondent Kittitas Reclamation District (Washington) compensation pursuant to 1959 Wash. Laws 303. The State argued the District was not entitled to compensation and that 1959 Wash. Laws 303 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to condemn for highway purposes 52 acres of irrigable land in the District. Eleven acres were being irrigated and the remaining 41 acres were capable of being served by District facilities. The parties stipulated that the District had no bonded indebtedness and that there would have been no reduction or increase in the total operation costs resulting from the severance of the 52 acres. They agreed, however, that there was an annual increase in operation costs against the remaining lands due to the loss of contribution from the severed lands. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's determination that under 1959 Wash. Laws 303, the District was entitled to compensation in an amount representing the pro rata share of the District's contractual indebtedness chargeable to the 52 acres of irrigable lands being condemned and an annual sum for the increased operation costs against the remaining lands. The court concluded that because the District was being deprived of a right to collect the pro rata share of operation costs against the land involved, it was being deprived of a compensable property right for which it was constitutionally entitled to compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electors voted for formation of a water district, but refused to authorize the levying of a tax to pay for the water system. The Commissioners obtained a federal loan to finance the planning of the system and contracted with the engineers for that purpose. A balance remained due to the engineers after the loan proceeds were paid to them. Before the balance was paid, the electors petitioned for dissolution of the water district. The engineers filed an action to restrain the County officials from submitting the dissolution proposition to the electors. The trial court granted the engineers' motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoined the holding of the election. Reversing and dissolving the obligation, the court found that it did not need to reach the question of whether the threatened dissolution constituted an impairment of the engineers' contract rights. If dissolution was a legislative act, the suit was premature because the court could not enjoin proposed legislative action. If the statute itself, which allowed for the dissolution by vote, was the act, the action was meritless because laws existing at the time the contract was formed did not impair the obligation.</SPAN></P>

The Commission took no action on the other sections of the ordinance. The trial court concluded that Union Gap, Wash., Code No. 305 had not become effective on the date of defendant's arrest, for want of approval by the Commission. The city contended that so long as the sections of the ordinance in question did not conflict with state law, they did not need the approval of the Commission. In support of this position, the city relied upon Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11. But the court held that Wash. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 19.90 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the only time that a sale might have destroyed or tended to destroy competition or injure competition wrongfully was where it was below cost and plaintiffs failed to offer proof that defendants had made sales below cost. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the Washington Unfair Practices Act (Act) was constitutional because it was within the authority of the state's police power. The court also held that the rationale of the Act was to have prohibited a seller from making or entering into any collateral contract or device of any nature, whereby a sale below cost was effected to the injury of a competitor. The court determined that there was a contrary intention in the statute and therefore because the statute was subject to more than one possible interpretation, the interpretation that rendered the statute constitutional was used and therefore plaintiffs had to have had proof that defendants had made the sales below cost.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of industrial insurance appeals dismissed a claim for benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act filed by the widow of a decedent with respondent department of labor and industries. Appellant administrator sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which affirmed the board's order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department rejected the widow's claim for benefits and appeal was taken to the board. At the conclusion of the last of several hearings, a continuance was granted, but the widow died before another hearing could be held. The administrator filed a petition requesting to be substituted as the widow's personal representative for further hearing of the pending appeal. The board granted the department's motion to dismiss upon the ground that the widow's claim did not survive to her personal representative. The court determined that the board did not have a duty to enter an order nunc pro tunc because both parties were desirous of presenting further testimony at the conclusion of the last hearing and thus, the cause was not ripe for judgment. The court found that pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.040, the claim of an injured workman who died during the pendency of his claim did not survive to his personal representatives. Affirming, the court held that the widow's claim did not pass to her personal representative because the statute made no distinction in its effect between an unadjudicated claim of an injured workman and an unadjudicated claim of a widow.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 66.44.190 prohibited sales of intoxicating liquors on the grounds of the University of Washington and within a described area surrounding it. Appellants owned property within the boundaries of that area. They contended, in their action for a declaratory judgment, that the law was discriminatory because it did not apply to similar areas surrounding other institutions of higher learning in the state. The trial court dismissed the action and the court affirmed. The court first noted that legislation regulating or even prohibiting the manufacture, sale, serving or possession of liquor was as an exercise of the police power of the state. The court then found that the legislature was entitled to take into account the special characteristics, problems, and circumstances of the university and to enact legislation which it deemed necessary to meet the special requirements of the institution. The contention that the law did not apply alike to all persons similarly situated was without merit. The only persons similarly situated were those who were within the boundaries of the designated area. Upon those, the law operated uniformly.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance No. 90316, &sect; 338 declared unconstitutional on the grounds that the private burdens outweighed the public benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city passed &sect; 338 to regulate the fencing height and access requirements for vehicle wrecking yards, the owners filed an action that sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court awarded the owners a declaratory judgment, and the city appealed. The court reversed the portion of the judgment invalidating the fencing requirements, holding that &sect; 338 did not conflict with state law, but permissibly enlarged upon state requirements. Further, there was a presumption of constitutionality and the rules of construction mandated an interpretation that would not lead to gross injustice or absurdity. The ordinance was not discriminatory, and it's goal of minimizing crime and vandalism was within the scope of recognized police power. Further, the city could enact legislation that promoted aesthetic values, so long as that was not the only goal of the legislation. The court found, however, that the portion &sect; 338 that limited the owners' street access was an unreasonable limitation on their property rights because neither the ordinance nor the record contained any standards permitting alleviation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged a judgment from the Superior Court for Thurston County (Washington) in favor of respondents, the State of Washington and others, that money received by it in overpayment of freight on lumber and plywood sold and shipped to buyers outside the State constituted a part of the gross proceeds of such sales for State tax purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's manufactured products included plywood and lumber. Its intrastate shipments were FOB (free on board) the mill, while its interstate sales were FOB the point of delivery. Its interstate price list included, as a separate item, estimated freight costs. For various reasons, estimated freight charges were almost always greater than actual charges. By industry custom, manufacturers such as the taxpayer kept the amount of these differences, which were called &quot;underweights.&quot; In computing the taxpayer's manufacturing tax, the Tax Commission included the underweight revenues as part of the gross proceeds derived from the sale of the taxpayer's manufactured goods shipped out of state. The taxpayer filed its action challenging this practice, and lost. On appeal, the court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the underweights should not have been counted because it retained title to the products until they were delivered. Contrary to the taxpayer's position, the term &quot;sale&quot; as used in the revenue act included the taxpayer's out-of-state shipments even before they were delivered and accepted, so the amount of the &quot;underweights&quot; was properly taken into account for tax purposes.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 35.21.010, notwithstanding that certain persons owned more than 20 acres of unplatted land within the corporate limits and did not expressly consent to such inclusion, where such persons had full notice of the proceedings, made no attempt to enjoin the proceedings, and did not make any objections thereto for nearly three years. In view of the actual notice to the owners and their failure to object or pursue any remedy available to them, the findings of the board that the incorporation statutes had been followed and fully complied with was an implied finding that there were no non-consenting 20-acre tract owners within the boundaries of incorporation.
