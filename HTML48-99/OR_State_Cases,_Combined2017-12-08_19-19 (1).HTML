Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.105.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.105, which permitted the governing body of the most populous city in a standard metropolitan statistical area to propose creation of a mass transit district, constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and a disenfranchisement of people in the district who were not city residents. In affirming the dismissal of their suit, the court held that the decision to vest in affected cities the election to make operative legislation regarding mass transit was itself as much a legislative policy determination as the decision to deal with the mass transit problem in the first place. If the court were to strike the delegation down, it would be encroaching on a legitimate legislative domain. Citizens did not have a constitutional right to vote on every question their government found it necessary to resolve. The policy decision to impose a tax was made by the legislature, not by the district. Delegation to the district of the power to choose a methods of raising money under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.300 did not fall outside constitutional limits, as the district was a municipal corporation that had the power to impose taxes.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The title of the Act was constitutionally sufficient because it sufficiently expressed what the subject of the legislation was.

The court noted that the potential candidate confused the eligibility for office with an entitlement to the support of a major party nomination. The statute challenged did not bar her from becoming a candidate by other methods. The court held that it was within the power of the legislature to adopt reasonable requirements designed to ensure that proper persons would be placed on election ballots. The court concluded that the requirements of &sect; 249.221 were reasonable means to preserve the integrity of the party labels. The practical effect of the statute was not to increase the age requirement for members of the Oregon legislature.

A faction that opposed the creation of the district initiated an amendment to the city's charter, which required that all parking districts previously formed be dissolved within 60 days unless the district was approved by petition of a majority of the landowners within the district. The city council declared that a majority approved the parking district, and the property owner challenged the declaration. The property owner brought a mandamus proceeding against the city council to compel the dissolution of the district. The trial court denied the property owner's petition, and the court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court held that the charter amendment as a whole was municipal legislation. The court found that the amendment established a permanent rule of law that the existence of all parking districts was contingent upon the approval of a majority of the property owners in the district.

While doing so, the officer inadvertently noticed at the place where he opened the book a notation of &quot;Doctor Jack (and I help) gave Dawn an AB at my house.&quot; The officer called a superior to see whether he could look through the second diary for a similar memorandum on the date of the alleged commission of the crime under investigation and was told to go ahead. A similar notation was found recorded on the appropriate date. On appeal, the court held that the seizure of defendant's second diary was unauthorized because it was a magistrate's, and not an officer's, duty to determine whether an invasion of the additional area of defendant's privacy was justified by the information inadvertently discovered in the first diary.

Stat. &sect; 98.302 et seq., which provided that all private and public holders of property that was presumed abandoned were to be delivered to the state for safekeeping and for ultimate delivery to the owner of the property. Further, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 98.366, the holder, including the county, of any abandoned property was relieved from any liability in respect to the delivery of the property to the state. The court reversed with instructions to issue the peremptory writ, finding that the property was governed by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 98.336, as a fund held by a public officer, and that such fund became abandoned when it remained unclaimed by the owner for more that seven years.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the statute was constitutional and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held: (1) a state's police power may be exerted in the form of state legislation where otherwise the effect may be to invade rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment only when such legislation bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of the general welfare; (2) there is a possibility that an unprotected motorcyclist's head could be hit by a object rendering the motorcyclist unconscious and creating a danger to other motorists and members of the public adjacent the highway; (3) &sect; 483.443(1) bore a real and substantial relationship to public safety; and (4) the legislature, in passing &sect; 483.443(1), created no unconstitutional imbalance between the personal liberty of the individual and interest of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for wilfully and lewdly exposing, fondling, and manipulating his private parts in the presence and view of a 10-year-old girl. Defendant was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.210. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and directed the trial court to discharge defendant in the proceeding. The court held that the freewheeling power to legislate so as to find a defendant guilty should not be institutionalized in a criminal statute. The court further held that such a statute would not only create a serious danger of inequality in the administration of the criminal law, but it ran squarely contrary to the purpose of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, which prohibited the delegation of legislative power. The court concluded that the very looseness of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.210 encouraged the prosecution to utilize the statute selectively to rid the community of individuals deemed subjectively less desirable than other offenders. The court held that it was the looseness of the language that offended due process and made the catchall clause of the statute an instrument of potential abuse.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the broadcaster, and the secretary of state and the attorney general appealed. The court noted that the US Supreme Court held invalid a similar provision of the Alabama Corrupt Practices Act because it violated the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

The juvenile also argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.500, which provided that the juvenile court need only find that the child had committed the alleged delinquent act, was contrary to the Due Process Clause of both the federal and the state constitutions and the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution. The court disagreed and affirmed the order, holding that the consequences of adopting the reasonable doubt standard in juvenile court would be to introduce a strong tone of criminality into the proceedings. The court held that it was essential that the juvenile court can and should acquire jurisdiction over a juvenile when the juvenile had evidenced symptoms that indicated that unless the court intervened the juvenile was likely to engage in conduct detrimental to himself and to the community.</SPAN></P>

As conduct, the nudity of employees was as fit a subject for governmental regulation as was the licensing of the liquor dispensaries and the fixing of their closing hours.

XI, &sect; 6, which prohibited the purchase of corporate stocks by the state of Oregon. The trial court declared the Act unconstitutional, and the members of the Council appealed. The court reversed. The court concluded that Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 6 applied only to public monies owned by the state. The state did not have a propriety interest in the funds at issue but was merely holding the funds as trustee or custodian. Therefore, the purchase of corporate stock with money from the funds was not constitutionally prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seeking injunctive relief, plaintiffs, operators of passenger bus transportation systems, challenged ordinances that extended and changed the routes of defendant transit company both within the corporate limits of defendant city and over routes within the three air-mile radius beyond the city limits. The Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) rejected the operators' claim for injunctive relief. The operators sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain of the transit company's routes extending beyond the city limits conflicted and competed with the operators' routes. On appeal, the court held that ORS 767.035(1) was constitutional because the state legislature properly granted the power to regulate utilities to municipalities like the city. The operators also claimed that the city's failure to comply with ORS 221.420(2) invalidated the ordinances. ORS 221.420(2)(c) gave the state utility commissioner a power to review rates. The city never submitted the subject ordinances to the state utility commissioner. The court held that ORS 221.420(2)(c) did not conflict with or restrict ORS 767.035(1) because the earlier statute,&nbsp;ORS 221.420(2)(c), was limited to the regulation of rates. Thus, the two statutes were designed to accomplish different purposes, and it was not the court's function to decide that the legislature had enacted conflicting statutes unless the acts clearly required it. Finally, the court held that the ordinances did not exceed the charter authority of the city and that sufficient notice was given in respect to hearings on the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that: (1) implied consent to a breathalyzer test was not a violation of the drivers' constitutional privilege against self-incrimination because it was unrelated to a communication by the driver; rather, it was a search of the person and, therefore, was subject only to the question of reasonableness; (2) due process requirements were satisfied because the Implied Consent Law provided for an administrative hearing subject to judicial review; (3) equal protection rights were not violated because the Implied Consent Law affected all similarly situated persons the same; and (4) the Implied Consent Law did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because the legislature imposed a standard of reasonableness to be followed by the officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue was whether the Oregon Legislative Assembly could, constitutionally, delegate to an administrative agency the power to define an element of a crime. The State proved that, at the time and place stated in the indictment, defendant unlawfully sold lysergic acid diethylamide. The chemical compound described in the indictment was not listed in any statute as a dangerous drug, but was so designated in Regulation 80-005. Under chapter 475 of the Oregon Revised Statutes, a person who was about to sell a drug had to look to the regulations of the State Board of Pharmacy to see whether the drug had been designated as dangerous. In view of the clear legislative denunciation of traffic in dangerous drugs, and in view of the equally clear direction to the appropriate agency to discover and publish the names of drugs that would produce the effects which the legislature had declared to be a danger to the public, the seller of drugs was not denied due process of law when he was required to consult the regulations before he undertook to market a drug. The delegation in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.010(1) did not violate either the state or federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the material was not obscene as a matter of law and, therefore, could not be proscribed without restricting freedom in the dissemination of information. However, the court determined that the material appealed to and was intended to appeal to an unusual and excessive preoccupation with sex, it affronted national contemporary community standards, and there was no literary, moral, or other value in the material. Defendant further argued that the Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.151 was unconstitutional because it failed to meet the federal constitutional definition of obscenity in that it did not expressly require national community standards nor did it require that the material be utterly without redeeming social importance. However, the court determined that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.151 required application of the national standard. Further, the court held that the jury was so instructed as to the national standard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder for the shooting of his wife with a rifle. The indictment charged a felony murder in that defendant was accused of the carrying of the weapon with an intent to use the rifle against his stepson in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.220 and in the process shot and killed his wife. Defendant testified that he was examining the gun for needed repair and that the gun discharged when his wife attempted to take it from him. On appeal of the conviction, the court reversed because of the trial court's failure to admit evidence and errors in instructing the jury. The trial court erred in refusing testimony offered by defendant of an engineer who had prepared an exhibit demonstrating the defense's theory. The evidence was relevant and probative, and its refusal was based on a misunderstanding of what defendant was endeavoring to prove. The trial court's error in instructing the jury on the ingredients of a felony could have improperly permitted the jury to find defendant guilty of the felony because of the use of the weapon upon his wife.

The trial court held that the enforcement of the ordinances deprived the owner of property without due process of law. On appeal, the court found that the first ordinance, which prohibited the unloading of large quantities of petroleum fuels at other than bulk distribution plants, was a valid exercise of police power and did not offend either the federal constitution or the state constitution. However, the court found that the second ordinance, which concerned underground storage tanks, was an unwarranted regulation of a legitimate business and constituted a violation of the owner's rights. The evidence showed that there was no greater danger of fire from gasoline stored in a tank of 10,000 gallons capacity than in a tank of 3000 gallons capacity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a petitioner applying for a writ of habeas corpus, appealed a judgment of the Multnomah County Circuit Court (Oregon) that dismissed the writ by which plaintiff sought his release from custody under a warrant of arrest and extradition, arguing that the warrant of extradition issued by the governor of Oregon was invalid because the governor of Wyoming did not authenticate the documents attached to the request for extradition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was charged in Wyoming with forgery. While incarcerated pending trial, he escaped from jail. After he was in Oregon, Wyoming sought to extradite him on charges of escaping from jail and aiding prisoners to escape from jail. Based upon the Wyoming governor's request for extradition, Oregon's governor issued a warrant of extradition. Plaintiff petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the validity of the warrant of extradition. The circuit court rendered judgment dismissing the writ, and plaintiff appealed. In affirming, the court rejected plaintiff's argument that the documents attached to the extradition request had not been authenticated as required by ORS 147.030. The request for extradition recited that &quot;it appears by the annexed papers duly authenticated in accordance with the laws of the State of Wisconsin&quot; that plaintiff was charged with the described crime. This was an authentication of the supporting papers by the governor of Wyoming, and this recital was to be interpreted to mean that, because the governor regarded the papers as &quot;duly authenticated,&quot; he himself authenticated them; as such, the papers were authenticated as required by the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction, contending that the ordinance violated both the United States and Oregon Constitutions. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 16-617 was invalid on the ground that it violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and the Due Process Clause of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, as well as the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The court held that Portland, Or., Police Code &sect; 16-617, which was designed to permit arrests on suspicion, was void for vagueness. Section 16-617 made criminal the mere presence of a person on the streets when a police officer had the suspicion that the suspect did not have a lawful purpose in being there. The police officer's suspicion was the only standard prescribed for arrest and conviction. This criterion for arrest, which invited arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, was too vague to provide a standard adequate for the protection of constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 2-206(a) required certain city officials and subordinates to remove themselves from the city payroll when they became candidates for partisan or other offices outside the system of city government. The provision expressed the desire of the local voters to keep certain city officials out of state and national politics while they were drawing a city salary. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which held that &sect; 2-206(a) was unconstitutional based on another statute that had been declared unconstitutional in another case. The other statute barred too many persons from too many constitutionally protected activities without the showing of a compensating governmental purpose to be served. The charter provision in &sect; 2-206(a) relating to subordinates was severable from the one relating to elective officials. Upon severance, the limitation was narrowly focused upon the incumbent holders of three named offices. The charter provision was narrowly defined and served a justifiable purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged a violation of ORS 165.045, which denounced the crime of receiving or concealing stolen property.

The property was subject to restrictions imposed by the United States Forest Service. The tax court determined that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.060 required a valuation of the fee interest less a deduction for restricted use. The tax court then computed the taxpayer's interest as having a declining value over the life of the permit. The Commission then sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the taxpayer's interest should have been calculated as if it was the owner of the fee. The value of the property in question was in its use. If the taxpayer was making full use of the property, then it was subject to tax as if it were the record owner. However, the taxpayer was entitled to diminution in value for restrictions imposed upon him that were not applicable to an owner in fee. Therefore, the tax court was required to re-evaluate the value of the taxpayer's property without subjecting it to the declining value. The court also held that a prior case did not preclude the Commission's appeal. The court noted that no final judgment was rendered in the prior action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property was in the assessment zone. The owners brought writs of review seeking to void the proposed assessments. Owner two dropped its court proceeding. The trial court dismissed the owner one's writ of review. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The trial court was correct in refusing to allow additional evidence. A writ of review had to be tried on the record brought from the inferior court. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 223.825(2) required assessments levied to be against property benefited in proportion to the benefits derived. If the city council determined that particular property or properties, by reason of use, derived no benefit, it could not be assessed. The city ordinance prohibition of assessing existing public parking lots rested not so much on their being a class as that they simply could not be assessed because they received no benefit. If they were construed as being classified, however, it was only when such classification was arbitrary or unreasonable that the courts would strike down the attempted classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trucker was injured in an accident with an uninsured driver. He claimed uninsured motorist benefits under the issuer's policy. However, the insurer claimed that no such coverage existed.

On the trucker's appeal, the court affirmed. It found that the trucker's employer in fact had provided coverage to the trucker that was equivalent to that which he would have received under the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act; that the provision of that protection triggered an exception to the requirement in &sect; 736.317 that uninsured motorist coverage be provided; that the insurer therefore was not obligated to provide such coverage; and that the trucker was not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was serving an enhanced sentence as a habitual criminal. The sentencing court considered his foreign convictions in applying the Oregon recidivist law. He claimed the foreign convictions were invalid because of a denial of counsel and other constitutional defects. The trial court sustained the warden's demurrer to the petition finding the prisoner had lost his right to challenge his foreign convictions by not raising his questions at the hearing in which he was found to be a habitual criminal. On appeal, the court held that the demurrer should have been overruled and the cause should have been allowed to proceed to a factual determination upon the issues regarding denial of counsel. Oregon courts could entertain collateral attacks upon convictions entered in the courts of other states. The court determined that the prisoner's petition stated a substantial denial of counsel, and, if proven, the facts alleged a denial of a constitutional right sufficient to render an Oregon conviction void.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court found that two weeks after defendant was indicted on the larceny charge, a United States District Court sentenced him to the federal penitentiary for 18 months. Defendant was not returned to Oregon for trial on the larceny charge until he had completed his federal sentence. The court concluded that defendant could not complain about any delay in bringing him to trial after he was released from the federal penitentiary. The State offered to immediately try defendant by moving his case up the docket, but defendant refused the offer. The entire delay in bring defendant to trial was 10 months and nine days, mostly occasioned by defendant's incarceration in the federal prison. The court held that the 10 month delay did not amount to a violation of defendant's right to a speedy trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned 80,000 acres of land, some of which it sold for home sites. Nearby land was privately owned by 231 different owners. The taxpayer's land was reassessed, but its neighbors' land was not, and the taxpayer complained that the assessment was discriminatory. The trial court agreed and lowered the assessment. The court modified and affirmed. The court ruled that the Commission could not single out one taxpayer for discriminatory or selective enforcement of a tax law that applied equally to all similarly situated taxpayers. The court rejected the Commission's argument that its assessment was based on the taxpayer's classification of its land as home sites and held that the assessment was patently discriminatory. The similarity of neighboring land was established. The promotion and sale of home sites by other taxpayers was also established. The Commission's claim that the taxpayer's promotional efforts made its land unique was not supported by the evidence. The court ruled that the land was to be assessed as if all the surrounding land had been reassessed for that tax year and that the taxpayer was due a refund.</SPAN></P>

The judge's answer contested the good faith alleged by the attorney in his affidavit of prejudice filed in support of a motion to recuse the judge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of angling with more than one line and fined twenty dollars. On appeal, defendant filed a motion for a change of judge, supported by the attorney's affidavit of prejudice. The judge denied the motion and set the appeal for trial. The court granted an alternative writ of mandamus ordering the judge to withdraw from the case or to show cause why he should not withdraw. In answer to the writ, the judge contested the good faith alleged in the attorney's affidavit. Defendant's attorney moved to strike the answer on the ground that good faith could not be controverted. Treating the motion to strike as a demurrer, the court held that an affidavit of prejudice, if made in good faith, was sufficient to recuse the judge. However, the issue of good faith was properly raised in the proceeding under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.250. Therefore, a fact-finding hearing had to be held to determine the issue of good faith, and the attorney's burden of showing good faith would be satisfied if he proved that he received information about the judge which, if true, was a reasonable basis for a fear of prejudice; although proof of actual prejudice was not required.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered a hearing on the merits of the recusal motion before a senior circuit judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife and her husband were Oregon residents. Plaintiff's husband was a business invitee at defendants' damsite in Washington state, when he suffered injuries as a result of defendants' alleged negligence.

Specifically, Washington adhered to the common law rule denying a wife a right of action for loss of consortium resulting from a negligent injury to her husband, while Oregon conferred the right by statute. The court affirmed a judgment sustaining defendants' demurrer to plaintiff's complaint, adopting a new &quot;most significant relationship&quot; test to determine which law applied. Under this test, Washington had the most significant relationship with the occurrence and the parties, since both the conduct and injury occurred there. Accordingly, plaintiff's derivative action was also governed by Washington law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director awarded a contract for the purchase of safes to a bidder other than the lowest bidder. The taxpayers claimed that the proposed contract would be illegal and void and filed an action to enjoin the Director from entering into the contract. Defendants filed a motion to quash service of summons on them on the ground that the suit was one against the State of Oregon and barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Taking the taxpayers' allegations as true for purposes of the motion, the court ruled that the trial court erred in granting the motion to quash because, if proven, the allegations warranted injunctive relief. The court determined that, since the State could not authorize and did not purport to authorize defendants to award contracts in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 279.726, the State could not be affected and was not an indispensable party to the suit. The court noted that the Director could be enjoined if it appeared that he abused his discretion in awarding the contract to other than the lowest bidder, but that no decree could enter if the award was made in the legitimate exercise of the Director's broad discretion.</SPAN></P>

The tenants appealed the ruling, and the circuit court dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the tenants failed to file a bond required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 105.160.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Or. Rev.

The court stated that an action for forcible entry and detainer was a special statutory proceeding, in derogation of the common law. The court also ruled that the fact that the bond must provide for double the rental value was, no doubt, intended to prevent frivolous appeals for the purpose of delay and would compensate the landlord for waste or was in lieu of damages for the unlawful holding over by the tenants. The court determined that because there was a legitimate purpose for the classification made by the statute, the statute had a rational basis and its constitutional validity was secure.

The trial court ruled in favor of the county. The court affirmed. The foreclosure decree was not subject to attack by the widow. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 312.220 provided that a decree of foreclosure for delinquent taxes was conclusive evidence of its regularity and validity in all collateral proceedings, except where the taxes had been paid or the property was not liable to assessment and taxation. Section 312.230 barred any action attacking the validity of a sale upon foreclosure for delinquent taxes if not commenced within two years. The taxes had not been paid and the property was subject to assessment and taxation. All defects in tax foreclosure proceedings were deemed non-jurisdictional unless they deprived the taxpayer of his constitutional right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared that Or. Rev.

Neither party challenged the lower court's ruling that a portion of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 660.125(5) was constitutional, but the contractors' association alleged that &quot;the entire statute&quot; was unconstitutional and unenforceable. Because the unconstitutional part was easily severable, the court held that the remaining portion of the statute was constitutional and enforceable. Or. Rev.

That judgment convicted her of the crime of vagrancy in being a common prostitute. The crime of which she was convicted was defined by ORS &sect; 166.060. Defendant claimed that ORS &sect; 166.060 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under ORS &sect; 166.060(1)(d), the State had to prove for a conviction that defendant was a common prostitute. There was no actus reus in being a common prostitute; it was a personal condition or being of a certain character. The court saw no way of interpreting &sect; 166.060(1)(d) as outlawing only specific acts of prostitution, but it did not declare the law unconstitutional. In the case at bar, defendant was arrested after a police officer gave money to her on the condition of prostitution by her. The court ruled that the evidence of defendant's acts and the circumstances of the arrest showed patently that she was a common prostitute. It rejected defendant's argument that to prove the charge of vagrancy as a common prostitute the State had to prove multiple acts of sexual intercourse for monetary gain. The court ruled that defendant's status was evidenced by the circumstances by which she did the single transaction. The court wrote that there was ample evidence from which the jury could have decided that defendant was one that offered to engage indiscriminately in illicit sex. A single act combined with attending circumstances was sufficient to prove defendant was a common prostitute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously affirmed defendant's conviction for the principal offense that was the basis for the enhanced penalty proceeding. On appeal, defendant argued that when the three-year sentence was vacated, the conviction of a felony was removed. Defendant was convicted of, among other charges, injury to personal property, which constituted either a felony or misdemeanor. In a habitual criminal proceeding, the character of the conviction, felony or misdemeanor, was fixed by the initial sentence and the vacation of that sentence in order to impose an enhanced penalty did not affect that initial characterization. The trial court indicated it selected the injury to personal property charge as the principal offense and sentenced defendant to seven years. Using such charge as the principal offense, nine years would have been the maximum penalty. Under such circumstances, the court did need not to decide the constitutionality of the habitual criminal statute. Defendant was not prejudiced because the trial court selected as the principal offense the offense carrying the lesser maximum penalty.</SPAN></P>

The indictment against him charged that, at least in one instance, he had been paid in response to his solicitation. Defendant challenged the statute under which he was convicted, &sect; 161.310, contending it was void for vagueness. Without deciding the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 161.310, the court found that the indictment against defendant did not state a claim thereunder. The criminal nuisance statute was intended to cover offenses against the public peace, the public health and the public morals. This meant the acts should be openly outrageous to public decency. The acts defendant was charged with did not rise to the level of a criminal nuisance; thus the court found that the trial court erred in entering a conviction under the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed under a chain of title derived from a patent issued by the United States in 1884. The port commission claimed title under a statute first enacted in 1874 that granted certain tide and overflow lands to a railroad. Between 1874 and 1885, the railroad failed strictly to perform all the conditions of its grant under the 1874 statute. In affirming the decision, the court found that in 1884, the United States did not have the right to convey to its patentees any of the tidelands in question. If the lands now in question were owned by the state in 1885, the legislature constitutionally could not have conveyed such lands to plaintiffs' alleged federal patentees. Under Oregon Constitution, Art IV, &sect; 20, the title of an amendment to the 1874 act, Oregon Laws 1885, at 6, contained nothing to suggest a legislative purpose to convey state-owned lands to federal patentees. The purported conveyance of tidelands to patentees, if such was intended, was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of her sentence and conviction, defendant challenged the introduction into evidence of her signed statement, the taking of which allegedly was not preceded by advice of her Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. The statement was not a confession in the traditional sense; it was merely her admission of the shooting but not an admission of intent or an acknowledgement of guilt. The court found the admission of the statement into evidence was harmless and not a ground for reversal. Defendant also contended that, under the facts of the indictment, any sentence in excess of 15 years was excessive in violation of Art. I, &sect; 16, Oregon Constitution, which required penalties to be in proportion of the offense. Defendant argued that the penalty for an &quot;attempt&quot; could not legally be greater than the maximum provided by statute for the crime attempted and the maximum penalty for manslaughter was 15 years under ORS 163.080 (Oregon). The court agreed the sentence was unconstitutional. The charge laid was assault with intent to commit voluntary manslaughter; thus, the sentence greater than that for manslaughter was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died intestate. She left an estate comprised of both real and personal property.

Their action was contested by the State, which requested that the property be escheated to the State. The trial court found for the State. On appeal, the court modified and remanded with directions. The trial court's decree was modified in that the next of kin were declared to be decedent's heirs at law in respect to her real property only. The Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Consular Rights, Dec. 8, 1923, U.S.-Germany provision was construed to vest the title to real property of estates in the United States in German heirs and devisees. The requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 111.070(1)(b), (c) placed additional requirements upon such vesting and were therefore in conflict with the treaty and were of no effect. The provisions of the statute could not operate to bar the right of German heirs to inherit real property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon), which dismissed his amended petition for post-conviction relief. The petition alleged that the inmate had pled guilty in the circuit court to a burglary charge. Imposition of sentence was suspended, and he was granted probation. Later, upon hearing before the circuit court, his probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to three years in the penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition alleged that the inmate was not represented by counsel in the revocation hearing and was not advised of his right to court appointed counsel as an indigent. Thus, the proceedings and the sentence were unconstitutional and void. On appeal, the court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had held that a defendant in a felony case had a right to counsel at every stage of trial. State courts that had passed upon the right to counsel at the &quot;sentencing stage&quot; had held in the affirmative. ORS 137.550(2) provided that a court, after summary hearing, could revoke the probation and, if no sentence had been imposed, impose any sentence that originally could have been imposed. In such a case, by virtue of the statute, the revocation hearing and the sentencing hearing were one and the same. Thus, the inmate had a right to counsel at the revocation hearing, and the circuit court erred in sustaining a demurrer to his petition with respect to this cause of action. The demurrer was properly sustained as to his claim based on the right of an indigent defendant to appointed counsel in a misdemeanor case because he had not complied with certain requirements for post-conviction petitions.</SPAN></P>

He argued that he was deprived of his right of freedom of expression, equal privileges and immunities, equal protection of the laws and liberty, and property without due process.

While the deputy sheriff did not have a constitutional right to be employed by the public, the government was not free to place unconstitutional prerequisites upon a securing of public employment nor did it have a right to ignore the constitution if it desires to terminate such employment. The statute encompassed too broad a scope and would have prevented the deputy sheriff from becoming a candidate for state, federal or nonpartisan office.

The court rejected the Commission's claim that only income attributable to intrastate activities was excludable because the Commission's interpretation would result in double taxation of income and would require a conclusion that the state legislature intended to enact a corporate income tax that was separate from the preexisting corporate excise tax and was inconsistent with statutory language, the chronology of the statutes' enactment, and the judicial decisions extant at the time thereof.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the crime of assault with a dangerous weapon under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.205. Defendant appealed his conviction, raising the issue of whether &sect; 163.250 was unconstitutional because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.320, which defined the crime of pointing a firearm at another, prescribed a different and lesser punishment for the same act committed under the same circumstances by persons in identical situations. The court held that the identical question was decided adversely to defendant's contention in another case, and therefore it demonstrated that there was no constitutional infirmity in the statute. The court noted that the brief of defendant contained no assignment of error as required by the Rules of the Supreme Court. It was not the function of the court to pass upon abstract questions of law, but to review alleged errors of the trial court when properly raised on the record; in criminal, as well as in civil cases, the right to review depended upon observance of this elementary requirement.</SPAN></P>

The uncontradicted testimony of all of the witnesses was that the intention and understanding of the parties was that checks drawn on the account required the separate signatures of two of them. The court found that the signature card in its uncompleted form was ambiguous and that the jury had the right to infer from the uncontradicted evidence that a check drawn by petitioner alone was not a valid check. One of the two checks was payable to the local telephone company and included petitioner's personal phone bill. The second check was payable to petitioner himself. The record was replete with evidence that the accounts of the corporation, which petitioner maintained, were complicated and confused, but there was ample evidence from which the jury could have found that he intended to use the proceeds of these checks for his own purpose.</SPAN></P>

On November 20, defendant was indicted him for murder. On December 20, defendant turned 16. The juvenile court remanded him to the circuit court on January 14, 1965. On appeal from the remand order, defendant argued, inter alia, that a remand was possible under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.533 only if a child were 16 at the time of the alleged offense. Alternatively, he argued that once juvenile court jurisdiction had been invoked over a child below 16, the juvenile court's exclusive jurisdiction could not be relinquished. The court affirmed the remand order. There was no basis for holding that taking a defendant into custody as a juvenile worked some sort of a fatal election against the State. Also, &sect; 419.533, on its face, provided for discretionary remand after the age of 16, regardless of the age of a defendant at the time of the alleged offense. Further, there was no basis for challenging the statute under the equal protection or due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bar, through its affidavits, made several contentions concerning the alleged practice of law by the attorney during the period of his summary suspension, alleging that after his suspension, the attorney discussed the settlement of a case. The court held that the power of a constitutionally established court to punish for contempt could be regulated within reasonable bounds by the legislature, but not to the extent that the court's power was substantially impaired or destroyed. The provision of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33.020(1) limiting the court's power to punish for an indirect contempt to a fine of $ 100, except where the right or remedy of a party was prejudiced, was an unreasonable limitation upon the court's inherent powers. It was, therefore, unconstitutional as applied and it violated Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, in that it substantially destroyed the court's power to enforce its lawful orders and decrees and was an attempted exercise of a judicial function by the legislative branch of government. The court concluded that the attorney was guilty of contempt of the court because of his violation of the court's order summarily suspending him from the practice of law.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was convicted for violating ORS 163.250 (Oregon). The inmate contended that ORS 163.250 was rendered unconstitutional by the subsequent enactment of ORS 163.320 (Oregon), which prohibited the pointing of a firearm at another. The inmate asserted that he believed that he was pleading guilty to a misdemeanor. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court stated that ORS 163.250 was not unconstitutional because there was a rational distinction between the acts denounced therein and those denounced in ORS 163.320. The court found that ORS 163.250 was enacted to punish an actual assault, whereas, ORS 163.320 was enacted to close a statutory opening through which persons who pointed firearms at others could escape liability for any crime if they could have shown that the act was one of horseplay or mischief not amounting to an actual assault.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania corporation had its principal office in Philadelphia. It sold pharmaceutical products in interstate commerce. To conduct its only activity in Oregon, the corporation employed professional representatives who traveled to businesses and sold the product. The Commission requested that the corporation pay net income tax. The corporation filed an action to set aside the Commission's income tax assessment. The court reversed the tax court's judgment that was rendered in favor of the Commission. Pub. L. No. 86-272 prohibited the states from collecting taxes that were measured by net income from natural or artificial persons that were engaged in interstate commerce when its only business activity was the solicitation of orders for the sale of personal property. The corporation's activities fell within the taxation exemption. Section 86-272 was constitutional because the legislation was not in excess of the power of Congress to regulate commerce. The Congressional power over the taxation of the revenues of interstate commerce was supreme and any state action that was contrary to &sect; 86-272 was required to yield to the federal legislation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended it was unconstitutional for the city's ordinance to entirely exclude wrecking yards as a permitted use within the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner operated a wrecking yard within the city as a non-conforming use. When the property owner extended that use onto contiguous property without the authority of the city, it was cited and convicted for improperly extending that use. The property owner appealed, contending that the city ordinance was unconstitutional because it totally excluded wrecking yards as a permitted use within the city and provided no procedure to seek relief on a hardship basis. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the ordinance was not unconstitutional and that the city had the authority to totally exclude wrecking yards as a permitted use. The court determined that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 227.220, 227.230 the city could exclude the use if it had a rational basis for doing so. The court held that the city could base its decision on total exclusion of the use based upon aesthetic sensibilities within its police powers. The court concluded that the concept of the public welfare represented the spiritual, physical, monetary, and aesthetic interests of the municipality and could be used to exclude the proposed use if the same would act to the overall detriment of the community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the city and upheld its authority to exclude wrecking yards as a permitted use within the city.</SPAN></P>

The deductions did not represent expenditures connected with the production of Oregon income or Oregon property. The refund was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.360, which restricted deductions to income arising from sources within the State of Oregon was not a denial of the privileges and immunities of citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment and U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, because the clause did not preclude disparity of treatment when there are independent reasons for it. The court concluded that the taxpayers were not discriminated against because they were nonresidents, and that Oregon had an independent justification for allowing deductions only on income earned in Oregon based on Oregon's interest in regulating interstate investors and commuters, and that Oregon was justified in only allowing personal deductions that were closely related to Oregon.</SPAN></P>

The evil sought to be remedied by &sect; 652.335 was to prevent the separation of food service from the liquor operations of an establishment and allocated the risk that an irresponsible manager of the food services would vanish without paying the employees' wages, placing that risk on the appellees.</SPAN></P>

The passenger and the driver had gone to a dance. Both had been drinking beer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no allegation or proof that either was intoxicated. The parties left in the driver's pickup truck. Shortly thereafter, the vehicle failed to negotiate a curve and left the road. From the passenger's description of the driving, the jury could have found that the driver had disregarded even the limited duty that he owed to the passenger as a guest passenger. However, the jury could equally well have found that the accident occurred because of a tire failure and without any fault on the part of the driver. The passenger contended that the trial court, in striking out the defense of assumption of the risk, necessarily ruled that there was no evidence that the passenger placed himself in a position of danger. The court held that the trial court correctly struck out the affirmative defense of assumption of the risk, but it did not follow that it erred in permitting the amendment, or in submitting the amended statement of the issue to the jury. The court held that evidence of the driver's drinking of a substantial amount of beer, known to the passenger, with nothing more, supported the submission of contributory negligence to the jury in a case brought under ORS 30.115 (Oregon).</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that he had previously been declared a spendthrift by an Oregon court and placed under a guardianship. The guardian declared that the obligations under the notes were void. The plaintiff contended that the notes were executed and delivered in California, which did not recognize the disability of a spendthrift, and that the Oregon court was bound to apply the law of the location where the contract was made. The trial court rejected plaintiff's argument and held for defendant. The appeals court affirmed, holding that the law of the place of the making of the contract would usually apply unless the forum state had a strong public policy interest in applying its own laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the sentence imposed was cruel and unusual and that ORS 137.111, which provided for a life sentence in certain circumstances, was unconstitutional. The trial court had found that defendant fell under ORS 137.111(1) because the offense involved a child under the age of 16 years. The trial court also had found that defendant was suffering from a mental condition as outlined in ORS 137.111(2). On appeal, the court found that the sentence was within the authority of the trial court to impose. Thus, the court was not justified in substituting its discretion for that of the trial court. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional. The legislature had the power to designate certain factual situations in which criminal penalties could be enhanced without the necessity of a jury trial.

Furthermore, the fact that the school district officials failed to adhere to the mandatory requirement of public notice of election did not justify a collateral attack because strict compliance with the rules was not necessary, substantial compliance was sufficient. The court also determined that it was unnecessary for the school board in a regular or special meeting to have made a specific determination of the residency of each pupil because it was sufficient that a subordinate officer of the board made those determinations under the board's direction. Finally, the court concluded that the issue of the children's residency was not a jury issue because there was no conflict concerning where the children lived and no evidence challenging the reasonableness of the tuition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary refused to furnish a ballot title for the measure because the attorney general had advised him that the petition proposed a revised constitution and that the initiative power reserved to the people to amend the constitution did not permit submission of a revised constitution. The court disallowed the writ, holding that the measure sponsored by the governors was a thorough overhauling of the state constitution. The document commenced with the customary &quot;the people of Oregon ordain this constitution&quot; and included an article providing for the transition period. It was 56 typewritten pages in length and contained many important changes. Whether it was a revision or a new constitution, it was not a measure that could have been submitted to the people through the initiative. There was much in the document to indicate that it was intended to be a new constitution rather than a revision, and that those who drafted it considered it as a new constitution. The Secretary was charged with no duty or authority to furnish the governors with a ballot title.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction and held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict. The court held that it was true that &sect; 162.322(2)(d) required &quot;official detention,&quot; but that &sect; 162.322(2)(b) required detention in a facility for the custody of persons under charge or conviction of crime. The court held that the county jail was such a facility, even though it was also used for the imprisonment of municipal offenders.The court further held that the mere fact that defendant was allowed to work outside on a farm in the daytime did not change the nature of his detention or confinement, and that escape from the farm had no legal significance different from an escape from the reformatory or county jail itself.</SPAN></P>

The search of the trunk of defendants' vehicle was lawful and therefore the trial court had not erroneously admitted the burglary loot into evidence. Defendants were lawfully stopped, and placed under arrest for speeding. That alone, however, did not justify a search of defendants' vehicle. The officer, who was a former game warden, upon seeing the rifle reasonably believed there was probable cause that defendants had committed a poaching violation, and that then supported the more intrusive search of the trunk of defendants' vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decree. If a fine were imposed it would ratify an order which the court had declared invalid and unconstitutional.

The proceeding against respondent State Industrial Accident Commission sought, among other things, to have certain provisions, ORS 656.810, 656.812, and 656.814, of the Oregon Occupational Disease Law declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workman applied to the State Industrial Accident Commission for compensation under the Occupational Disease Law. After his claim was disallowed, he &quot;rejected&quot; the order and submitted his claim to the Board of Medical Review, as provided in ORS 656.808. The Board concurred in the decision of the Commission, and the case was closed. The workman contended that the absence of a specific procedure for judicial review rendered the finality clause of the statutory scheme unconstitutional. It was his theory that if he could have the finality clause of the Occupational Disease Law stricken as unconstitutional he would obtain the benefits of the Occupational Disease Law by means of the procedural tools of the Workmen's Compensation Law. The court held that the workman's assumptions in this regard were mistaken and that it was not necessary to decide constitutional questions. It was equally clear that the challenged sections of the Occupational Disease Law were not severable from the remainder of the statutory scheme. Affirming the order, the court ruled that the challenged sections were so essential to the legislative intent that without them the statute would not have been enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner claimed that the 40-year sentence under which he was imprisoned as an habitual criminal was fatally defective because the statute under which he was sentenced was either unconstitutional or was unconstitutionally applied in his case. The trial court denied his petition for post-conviction relief, and the court affirmed on other grounds. The court held that there was no deprivation of the prisoner's constitutional rights in the proceedings leading to his incarceration. The possibility that the sentences could run to unservable lengths did not make Oregon Code, 1930, 13-2802 unconstitutional. While the judgment order sentencing defendant as an habitual criminal erroneously stated that he was convicted of being an habitual criminal, the judgment order fixing the sentence had to be read together with the information and the verdict. When the documents were read together it was apparent that neither the prisoner nor the sentencing court were in doubt as to the basis for the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The landowners objected to the tax on the ground that it was a property tax, and was invalid because it was not assessed upon an ad valorem basis. The trial court agreed, and the tax commissioner appealed the decision. The court concluded that the tax was not an exercise of the state's taxing power. Rather, it was an exercise of the state's police power, and as such, it was valid. The court noted that the state had a serious interest in preventing and containing forest fires, thus the creation of the fund was necessary in furtherance of the health and welfare of the people of the state.

Laws ch. 584, p. 1101, violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 as a sentencing law that was not founded on the principle of reforming a convict. The warden sought review of the trial court's ruling, and petitioner sought review of the trial court's refusal to find that the information that charged him with burglary was factually insufficient or that the Act was violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision holding the Act to be unconstitutional, finding that the Oregon Constitution did not require that reformation be sought at substantial risk to the people of the state. The court also ruled that the Act did not violate art. I, &sect; 16 and that petitioner's challenge to the information was not a basis for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

Tax Reg. 6.010(5) did not necessarily make a distribution taxable as a dividend that would otherwise have been taxable as a distribution in partial liquidation. The regulation did no more than add some meaning to the &quot;bare bones.&quot; The purpose was to tax, as a dividend, every distribution made by a corporation to its stockholders that was clearly not a distribution in complete or partial liquidation. The redemption or cancellation of the stock mentioned in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;316.010 (5) must have been accomplished in respect to some liquidating process.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court reasoned that the employers' assumed that the statute unfairly penalized an employer that made an honest and innocent error either in computing what he owed an employee or in assuming that his the employee was still in his employ. However, the court stated that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;652.150 operated only where an employer willfully failed to meet the obligations outlined in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 652.140.

The court explained that no pleading was required in cases of direct contempt, but the offense could be punished summarily under ORS 33.030. The court noted that in cases of direct contempt, jurisdiction of the person of the defendant attached instantly upon the contempt being committed in the presence of the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company supplemented the output of its plants by contracting for the production of some of its merchandise by outside contractors. The company included wages paid by the contractors and the value of property used by its contractors in calculating its excise taxes for two fiscal years, thereby resulting in a substantially smaller amount of state tax due than that due under the commission's calculation. The trial court dismissed the company's complaint against the commission seeking to set aside a deficiency assessment. The company appealed. The court held that the formula applied by the commission to the company's tax returns was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or in any sense unfair. Each contractor owned or leased and controlled its respective plants and equipment without any semblance of a leasing or subleasing to the company. Each contractor managed its own plant, hired, fired and paid its own employees, and retained in full all profits resulting from its negotiated agreements made with the company. As such, wages paid by the contractors and their estimated property costs were not activities that could be considered in determining where the company's income was earned.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 317.060. Defendant State Tax Commission affirmed. The taxpayer brought suit, alleging that it was a &quot;business corporation&quot; under &sect; 317.070.

First, the trial court correctly construed &sect; 317.010(10). The only question the court could consider was whether, by fair interpretation of &sect; 317.010(10), the taxpayer, the principal business of which was the purchase of conditional sales contracts from retail merchants, was &quot;lending money.&quot; The words &quot;lending money,&quot; however, could not be stretched far enough to include the taxpayer. The taxpayer's methods lacked the elements necessary to constitute loans. Second, the words &quot;unless the context required otherwise,&quot; as contained in &sect; 317.010, were not subject to the interpretation the Commission placed upon them. The reservation meant only that the statutory definition of a term was not to be used where the legislature did not intend it to be used at the time the act was drafted. When a deliberate choice of words had been made with intent that the statutory definition applied, as was the case in &sect; 317.060, then the court was required to give effect to the definition. Thus, the court concluded that the taxpayer was not a &quot;financial corporation&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 317.060.</SPAN></P>

The inmate brought a post-conviction proceeding that alleged that his sentence was in excess of that allowed by law.

The trial court dismissed the petition. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that ORS 165.205 and ORS 165.225 defined mutually exclusive crimes and that ORS 165.225 applied only where defendant had, prior to presenting the check, established an account in the bank upon which the check was drawn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company prayed that defendant Public Utility Commissioner be enjoined from requiring the company to furnish any passenger service over any part of its lines of railroad. The Circuit Court, Marion County (Oregon) entered a decree in favor of the company. The commissioner sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the company's passenger service declined, the commissioner ordered the company to continue furnishing such service by reason of the public necessity and convenience. The company sought to enjoin the commissioner's orders to that effect. The circuit court found in favor of the company. The commissioner appealed. Because proceedings of a penal nature should never be enjoined by a court of equity, the court modified the circuit court's decree to the extent that it forbade the commissioner from attempting to collect penalties for the company's noncompliance with the commissioner's orders. As modified, the court affirmed the circuit court's decree because the evidence showed that there was no good reason for the commissioner to order the company to continue furnishing railroad passenger service. First, there was insufficient patronage in the area served by the company's cars to pay at least the out-of-pocket expenses of rendering the service. Second, the company's patronage was on the decline and offered no prospects of increasing. Third, other suitable transportation service at equally low prices and operating with equal celerity was available.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that the state department of agriculture had the authority to restrict the baking of bread to certain maximum sizes. The court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 625.209 did not arbitrarily prohibit the manufacture of a wholesome article. The court noted that a regulation standardizing the size of containers was constitutional.

The court reversed and held that the lower court was justified in the order so far as it affected the debenture holders who had not filed claims, but erred as to the holders of Series 1 bonds. The court found that it was equitable that the funds be distributed among the creditors who appeared, but that no creditor was to receive more than the amount of his claim.

The contractor sought to enjoin the picketing and compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court dismissed the action for want of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the contractor's action was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. The contractor appealed, contending that Section 701(a) (29 U.S.C.S &sect; 164(c)) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 should have been given retroactive application because it was remedial in allowing state courts to assume jurisdiction over labor disputes over which the National Labor Relations Board had declined to assert jurisdiction. On appeal, the court held that, unless retroactive construction was mandatory by the terms of Act, it was to be applied only to activities occurring after the effective date of the Act, which excluded the activities which gave rise to the contractor's action. The fact that the court was at liberty to apply state law was a strong reason for holding that the Act should not have been applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under ORS 221.360, the court on appeal cannot save an ordinance except by affirming a void conviction. Since the refusal to reach the constitutional question previously resulted in a patent absurdity, the court on appeal had to consider the constitutionality of the ordinance. Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 made a sharp distinction between legislative restraint imposed prior to publication and penalties imposed afterward. Censorship by licensing was, of course, a prior restraint. One conspicuous vice of administrative licensing such as that challenged in the case was that it imposed the burden on the wrong party. After the censor had accomplished his work, there could be a right of appeal to an administrative agency and eventually to a court, but appellant bore the very considerable burden of showing that the censor has abused his power. This shifting of the burden alone was repugnant to art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Second, the references in the former opinion to violations of the ordinance as &quot;crimes&quot; or &quot;criminal&quot; should be understood in light of the well-settled rule in this state that violations of city ordinances are not necessarily crimes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that his constitutional right of equal protection under the United States and Oregon Constitutions was violated because the act that he was convicted for was punishable as a misdemeanor under another statute; therefore, the district attorney was thereby granted the power, at his election, to charge one person with an offense under the one statute and another with an offense under the other statute, though the identical act was committed. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The sole act of giving intoxicating liquor to a minor would not, of itself, violate Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.210. The act of giving intoxicating liquor, to a person under the age of 21, alone, constituted a crime under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 471.410. But when it appeared that the act was accompanied by circumstances which showed that it would tend to cause or did cause a minor to become a delinquent child, a different offense was made out. Defendant's act was punishable because it had that tendency, and that aspect of his conduct was not covered by any other statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers challenged the decision of the Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which upheld the constitutionality of Or.

The taxpayers sought injunctive and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 337.150 provided for the free use of textbooks to students residing in the school district. Under &sect; 337.150, students at a parochial school were provided textbooks. Taxpayers brought an action for injunctive and declaratory relief against the school district seeking to prevent the school district from supplying textbooks without charge to the students of the parochial school. The taxpayers also sought a judicial declaration that &sect; 337.150 did not authorize the school district to supply textbooks free of charge to church or parochial schools or, if the statute was so construed, that it be declared unconstitutional. A resident within the school district whose children were enrolled in the parochial school intervened. The lower court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal, the court reversed. The court concluded that the expenditure authorized by &sect; 337.150 was within the proscription of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 prohibiting the use of public moneys for the benefit of any religious or theological institution. The court rejected the school district's &quot;child-benefit theory&quot; that furnishing books to the students benefitted the students and not the schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer sought relief from the commission's determination that there was a deficiency in the taxpayer's state corporation excise tax. The trial court granted the taxpayer's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the commission appealed. The parties disputed whether the formula employed for the determination of allocable income should have included the factor of sales, as used by the taxpayer, or the factor of purchases, as applied by the commission. The court reversed the judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the taxpayer's complaint. The court noted that there was no formula that had been held superior. Pursuant to Oregon State Tax Commission Regulation 4.280(1)-(B), the commission's allocation formula substituted the purchase factor for the sales factor, thus giving weight to the taxpayer's property, wages, and purchases both within and without the state. The court held that the commission's allocation formula, including purchases instead of sales, appeared in its application to the taxpayer's business to have been an honest effort to apportion to Oregon that part of the taxpayer's net income fairly attributable to its business done in Oregon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's libel action alleged that the television station willfully, maliciously, and wrongfully broadcast false and libelous statements about plaintiff. The trial court granted the television station's motion to strike the complaint's allegations of general and punitive damages because plaintiff failed to allege that the television station intended to defame plaintiff or that it refused to publish a requested retraction of a non-intentional libel. The court affirmed finding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.155-30.175 required plaintiff to plead and prove intent or a refusal to retract as a condition precedent to the recovery of general damages. The court held that the legislature could limit common law remedies for defamation and that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 did not forbid the abolition of common law remedies. The court also found that a retraction was no less reparable to a person defamed than a judgment for money damages. The court determined that plaintiff's allegation that the defamatory statement was made &quot;willfully, maliciously, and wrongfully&quot; was a mere conclusion that was not sufficient to charge malice in fact to sustain plaintiff's claim for punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court overruled her demurrer to the complaint. Defendant had been convicted in a municipal court of violating Art. 30, Motion-Picture and Entertainment Supervision, Police Code of the City of Portland, Oregon, added by Ordinance No. 97898 passed and effective February 13, 1953.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a condition to the issuance of a license to exhibit the motion picture in question, defendant was directed to remove two scenes from the film. She exhibited the film without doing so. On appeal, the court found that nothing in the complaint advised defendant how the film fell short of any standards set nor why the censor ordered the scenes deleted. The ordinance purported to give the police chief some power to prevent the public display of obscenity; however, the complaint did not charge that any part of the film was obscene. To sustain the complaint would be to hold that the police chief had plenary power to order an exhibitor to edit any motion picture to satisfy the censor. That interpretation would make the ordinance patently unconstitutional. The court stated that it was bound to uphold the constitutionality of legislation when possible to do so. Because it was not a crime to disobey an order to splice a film, as directed by the police chief, the complaint did not state a violation. Reversing, the court held that it could not sustain the ordinance if it were construed to make defendant's conduct, as described in the defective complaint, criminal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that plaintiff's petition for the writ, even though it was considered as a complaint, wholly failed to state a cause of action against any of individual defendant. A writ of mandamus could properly compel an officer to perform such act as the law specifically enjoined, but the writ would not lie unless the duty sought to be enjoined was prescribed by the law as devolving upon such officer. The duty was of the essence of the cause of action. Facts had to be pleaded that showed its existence. Plaintiff's petition did not allege that the individual defendants or any of them were city officials or that any of them were charged with the duty to place an initiative measure on the ballot, nor was there any evidence upon that subject. Therefore, the court was constrained to reverse the judgment of the circuit court allowing the peremptory writ. Under the circumstances, the court deemed it proper to remand the cause for further proceedings include the right of plaintiff to apply to the circuit court for the allowance of appropriate amendments of his petition and pleadings.</SPAN></P>

Discretion as to sentencing did not make Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 164.830 violate equal protection. Contrary to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 132.320, 132.580, 135.510(2), the legislative intention was to require that the indictment show only those grand jury witnesses whose evidence was expected to be used at trial. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 132.320, which required that the grand jury hear only testimony competent in a court of law, was admonitory and not mandatory. It was not shown that pretrial publicity was so inflammatory that an impartial jury could not be selected. Testimony that at defendant's instigation a stink bomb was set off in a drugstore in the publisher's building was admissible as tending to show motive, design, or purpose for the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alternative writ alleged that during the regular session of the 51st legislative assembly, the members incurred telephone charges in the regular performance of their official duties; that they submitted a claim for reimbursement for such expenses; that each claim was approved; and that the claims were filed with the Secretary for audit and allowance as provided by the Resolution. The members further alleged that the Secretary refused to audit or allow either of the claims or to draw a warrant for the payment thereof because the Secretary contended that Senate Joint Resolution No. 1 was unconstitutional. The court concluded that state funds appropriated by the legislature for legislative expenses could be paid pursuant to the Resolution to individual members of the legislative assembly as reimbursement for legislative expenses actually incurred. Therefore, the court ordered that the writ would issue to require the Secretary to audit the claims. However, because the court noted that the allowance of the claims rests upon the exercise of the discretion of the Secretary, the court concluded that the writ could not require him to allow the claims.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 483.506. The State sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court, Douglas County (Oregon), which sustained an oral demurrer to the reception of evidence and entered judgment for defendant on the ground that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 483.506(3) was unconstitutional in treating classifications of vehicles differently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tandem axle weight on defendant's vehicle was 100 pounds in excess of that allowed for a log truck and 2,100 pounds in excess of that allowed by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 483.506(3)(c) for vehicles like his that were used to transport other commodities. Defendant contended that the statute was solely intended to protect highways from damage due to overloaded vehicles. He argued that there could be no valid distinction based upon the character of the load because an overload of logs would cause the same amount of damages as an overload of other commodities. Although the statute did not explicitly state the reason for treating log trucks more favorably, that was no obstacle to sustaining the legislation if there were any rational basis for such special treatment. The special treatment could be justified to foster the logging industry. It could also be justified based on the unique difficulties in properly distributing logs to conform to restricted gross axle and wheel weights. The court concluded that the classification was not arbitrary and that it did not violate the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses, or the privileges and immunities provision of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal government (government) allowed possessors by contract to use land for grazing under &sect; 15 of the Taylor Grazing Act, codified at 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 315m. The trial court ruled that there could not have been a tax on the lands under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.060. The court reversed and remanded because the possessors had a sufficient interest in the land to be subject to the tax because they were lessees. The court determined that the interests were sufficient enough for the possessors to be lessees and thus subject to taxation because the possessors' right to use the land was substantial and exclusive due to their control over the land for grazing. Section 307.060 was not unconstitutional as a tax on the government because the possessors were not representatives of the government. Also, because the tax treatments under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 307.110, 307.060 were the same, there was no discrimination against the government. Even if Or. Rev.

The prisoner filed another petition for post-conviction relief, which after being amended, alleged that the days he spent in the county jail while the prior petition was pending had not been counted toward his total sentence.

The court held that the &sect; 204.685(5), did not violate Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20 where the title of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 204.685(5) adequately described the subject matter of the statute. The court held that &sect; 204.685(5) was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconstitutional special or class legislation merely because it applied only to the employees of the sheriff of Multnomah County, Oregon. The court held that &sect; 204.685(5) did not violate Or. Const. art.

Finally, the court held that &sect; 204.685(5) had not been repealed by implication by the enactment of 1953 Or. Laws ch. 306 or Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 241.002 through 241.990.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the board's demurrer and denied the taxpayers relief. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the district had the power to transfer the students. The court reasoned that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 330.650, the district had the grant of power to build, furnish and equip school buildings, as described by Or. Rev.

The court held that obscenity was not within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, thus, obscenity was denied protection under federal law against judicially imposed prior restraints.

The agreement provided that the parents, in consideration of the settlement payment, agreed to save harmless the company's assured and the company from all claims for injuries to the minor. When the minor's injuries were discovered, the minor through the parents, brought a lawsuit against the assured to recover for the injuries. The minor recovered a judgment, which was paid by the company, and then the company brought its action against the parents to recover upon the indemnity agreement. The trial court entered judgment in the company's favor. The court on appeal reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that such an indemnity agreement was void as contrary to public policy because the parents owed the minor a duty to act for her benefit.

In examining these other statutes, the court held the school district and its representatives were responsible for carrying out &sect; 336.260's purpose. The court also held &sect; 336.260 had not given school districts unguided discretion to determine whether a pupil would be excused because &sect; 336.260 required excusal upon application.

The court noted that the circuit court had remanded the matter to the commissioner pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 756.600(1). Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 756.600(2) provided that after a cause was remanded to the commissioner, the commissioner could alter, modify, or rescind his order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The niece contended that under the statutory law of Oregon, before a guardian may be appointed, mental incompetence had to be proved and that the evidence in this case was insufficient. She further argued that to adopt any other statutory construction than the one urged would result in unconstitutionality as being violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Ore. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10 and 20. The court adopted the conclusions of the able trial judge in favor of the guardian. A fair review of the evidence indicated that although the uncle in casual conversation gave an appearance of mental capacity, his brain damage, in fact, interfered with the rational functioning of his mind, which made it impossible for him to manage his property. There was a decided change in his mental capacity as the result of his stroke so that he actually had no appreciation of the exact amount of his property, prices at which products were being sold, the amount of money had had in the bank or amounts owed to him or when due.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district, governed by Ore. Rev.

It sought relief against collection of the tax by the Commission, claiming that &sect; 317.074(1) either did not apply to the district or, if it applied, was unconstitutional. After the circuit court denied all relief, the district appealed but the court affirmed. It rejected the district's claim that the definition of &quot;corporation&quot; in &sect; 317.041(1) did not apply to it, holding that because &sect; 308.515 specifically referred to such districts, no further refinement of the definition of &quot;corporation&quot; was required. Moreover, the legislature demonstrated its intention to include such districts among the entities subject to the excise tax. The court thereupon held that the definition used in Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 317.010(2), which included all corporations, municipal, quasi-municipal and private, applied to the district as it had been held to be a quasi-municipal corporation and that the word &quot;corporations&quot; in &sect; 317.010 was broad enough to include the district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs had sought the recovery of the possession of a house and lot. The circuit court, after trial of the issues presented by the answer, entered a decree in favor of plaintiffs. The action did not progress any further than the notice of appeal and the undertaking. If defendants were required to meet the demands of ORS 105.160 they had to submit themselves to a liability of major proportions unless the rental value of the property described in the complaint was small. The statute, although making adequate provision for the protection of the landlord during the appeal, afforded none to the tenant. A familiar rule of statutory construction required courts to avoid constructions which rendered statutes unconstitutional or unreasonable in their exactions provided satisfactory reason could be given for a different result. The court concluded that that ORS 105.160 should be construed in its application to situations such as this as a stay undertaking and to render compliance with it necessary only in the event that the tenant remained in possession after the entry of judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court took original jurisdiction because of the public importance of the controversy. The Secretary filed a demurrer on the ground that the alternative writ failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary challenged the validity of ORS 171.071 (Oregon Laws 1959, ch. 391), which included an emergency clause that, as of May 5, 1959, increased the compensation for members of the legislature, to be paid out of appropriations for legislative expenses. The court agreed with the Secretary that ORS 171.071 was violative of Article IV, &sect; 29, Oregon Constitution, as amended in 1950. The court found that the language of &sect; 29 clearly provided a specified annual salary. The senator had contended that because &sect; 29 did not use the words &quot;not exceeding,&quot; as had the earlier versions of the provisions, this meant that &sect; 29 contained no express language of limitation of power of the legislature. As a result, he argued, the legislature was free to fix its own compensation. The court disagreed. It held that the people of Oregon had never conferred such power upon the legislature. Notably, the voters had rejected such measures on several occasions. Upon concluding that the legislature did not have the power to enact a statute increasing the compensation for services of its members beyond the salary provided by &sect; 29, the court held that ORS 171.071 was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the Secretary's demurrer and disallowed the writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary's compliance with the written demand for payment.</SPAN></P>

The indebtedness was secured by the certificate of title of a truck that was in the possession of the creditor and made out to him as legal owner or mortgagee, and by a mortgage on a loader. The debtor paid the creditor, but postdated the check. When the creditor cashed the check, payment was refused from debtor's account. The creditor swore to a criminal information charging the debtor with issuing the check with intent to defraud. The debtor was arrested and the criminal action was dismissed because it was untimely. The debtor brought a malicious prosecution action against the creditor, the trial court held in favor of the debtor, and the creditor sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the Worthless Check Statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.225, was not violated by the making or delivering of a postdated check if the payee accepted it knowing that it was postdated and there was no other representation that the check was good or the maker had sufficient money in his account at the bank or credit with the bank.</SPAN></P>

During the trial, the trial court entered a judgment of involuntary nonsuit. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court holding that an absolute privilege applied to discipline proceedings. The fact that the complaint made by the former client did not result in a formal hearing did not preclude the application of the rule of absolute privilege. An absolute privilege applied because the letter could be considered a communication preliminary to a judicial proceeding, or in the institution of or during the course and as a part of a judicial proceeding, and the letter was related to the disciplinary proceeding. The quasi-judicial nature of the bar's trial disciplinary procedure warranted the application of the absolute privilege. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.550 did not control the action because the statute was unconstitutional, and it unduly interfered with the judiciary's power to regulate attorneys under it.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because a lawful arrest preceded the search and the search and seizure, as incidents of the arrest, were lawful. Even if the search and seizure preceded the arrest, they were so closely related in time to the arrest and so circumstanced as to be reasonable, and hence subject to no constitutional infirmity. No ingenuity was required to fit defendant's conduct within the category of acts prohibited by &sect; 166.270. In possessing and controlling a weapon long enough to threaten others and in keeping it about him until overtaken by the police, defendant violated &sect; 166.170 at its most central point.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contended that the district created by 1927 Or. Laws 212, as compiled in Or. Comp. Laws.

Laws 529, &sect; 7, as serving to clarify the law regarding livestock districts by eliminating certain statutes that created those districts, but by continuing the districts under improved procedures. The court interpreted 1947 Or. Laws 529, &sect; 8, to find that certain statutory districts that were subject to repeal continued to exist under existing law. The court found that although 1947 Or. Laws 529, &sect; 8, kept a few statutory districts in existence, in another sense those districts were recreated by 1947 Or. Laws 529, &sect; 7, because that provision provided them with new life. The court found that 1957 Or. Laws 604, &sect; 32(1)(a), (b), provided that districts created by the statute and by vote of the people were to continue as originally created. The court concluded that an unbroken chain of legislation linked the law of the present with the law of the past and kept alive the district that plaintiff had challenged.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that a well-recognized function of the legislature in the exercise of its police power was to restrain dangerous practices and regulate the carrying and use of firearms in the interest of public safety. The court rejected defendant's equal protection argument, noting that a legislative classification based upon the proposition that convicted felons were less likely to commit crime if forced to remain unarmed was not capricious or irrelevant to the legislative purpose of protecting the public. Defendant also argued that the law was invalid because it would authorize conviction of an unarmed alien temporarily in the state who kept a gun in his native land. The court stated that defendant, who was not an alien, could not challenge the act under U.S. Const. amend.

The Board of Governors of the State Bar found the attorney guilty of 10 charges and recommended that he be permanently disbarred. The court permanently disbarred the attorney, determining that he was guilty of commingling client funds with his own and profiting from and failing to account to probate court and clients for profits made by him on funds of estate for which he was the attorney. The court found the attorney guilty of tampering with evidence in a criminal case by erasing his pencil notation from the back of a documentary exhibit. The attorney was guilty of speaking with a witness during a trial, telling the juror not to mention the conversation to anybody. Permanent disbarment of the attorney was an appropriate punishment under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.480 for his wilful deceit and misconduct and wilful violations of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.460. The attorney subordinated the concept of his profession as one of service to its consideration and employment as an aid in the promotion and furtherance of his business and financial interests.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered a decree that dismissed the action. The issues before the court were whether &sect; 377.130 authorized the Commissioner to remove the individual's signs and, if so, whether &sect; 377.130 was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment or Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The court reversed the circuit court's decree and enjoined the State from removing the individual's signs. The court held that &sect; 377.110 et seq., as applied to the individual, was violative of his constitutional rights because when the legislature decided to grant a period of grace in favor of existing signs, it was bound to treat all alike, unless there was some reasonable basis for granting it to some and withholding it from others. There was nothing in the nature of signs used to advertise the business of a single commercial enterprise that the legislature could have considered more likely to interfere with the safe and efficient use of the highways than signs erected and maintained by different advertisers.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the taxpayers' equal protection arguments, noting that the State was permitted to create classifications without violating equal protection, so long as the State did not discriminate amongst members of the class. Furthermore, classifications could be subclassified without violating equal protection. The court also rejected the challenge that the tax infringed upon the freedom of navigation upon the rivers and waters bordering and within Oregon. The court found it clear that the taxpayers were not being taxed for the privilege of using the waters, a usage tax upon navigation, or for a right of transit through the state. Rather, these were ad valorem taxes that had been specifically permitted in other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

The subpoena limited the commission's demand to the books, records, and files showing the names and addresses of persons from whom the corporation purchased forest products during a specified year and the amounts purchased during that period. There was sufficient identification of the records to satisfy the requirement of specificity both as to time and subject matter.

The court disagreed with the property owner's assertion that a feasible alternative was in use by the logging company. Neither of two roads reached the tract that the logging company planned to log. The other road was made up of a single lane and was often used by the public. It was not capable of accommodating, in addition to its regular traffic, the 100 log trucks per day that the logging company would employ. The road was not designed to handle traffic of that volume. The court also held that the logging company only had to prove that the taking of the property owner's road was reasonably necessary under ORS 376.510 (Oregon). The court also noted that the land that the logging company sought to take was in a mountainous area several miles distant from a highway and was virtually devoid of timber.</SPAN></P>

The inmate had challenged the validity of the sentence imposed on him as a third felony offender in two prior habeas corpus proceedings, both appealed and decided by the court. The grounds on which the validity of his imprisonment was challenged in the present proceeding were not raised in either of his two prior habeas corpus proceedings. The court found that under ORS 34.710 denial of the writ of habeas corpus was res judicata on subsequent application for the writ on grounds that could have been alleged in the prior habeas corpus proceedings.

The court disagreed, holding that the felony crime of assault and battery while unarmed by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury differed from misdemeanor assault and assault and battery in a reasonable and substantial way due to the addition of the &quot;by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury&quot; element. &quot;Great bodily injury&quot; meant more than a mere injury by the fist, such as was likely to occur in ordinary assault in battery.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the objectors attacked the decree upon the ground that the issuance of such permits would be in violation of their vested rights in the flow of the waters proposed to be stored and appropriated by the company. Further, the objectors argued that the right to a certain method of irrigation by natural overflow and drainage was acquired by use, and affirmed by a 1929 adjudication of the water rights in the area. However, the court determined that the system currently used was wasteful and, therefore, more economical methods were required to be employed to keep pace with modern developments. Further, the court determined that the method of irrigation used by the objectors was not a right but merely a privilege, to be enjoyed only until rendered impracticable by a fuller development and use of the unappropriated waters. The objectors argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction. However, the court held that the procedures followed were sufficient to vest jurisdiction of the cause in the trial court.

The owner alleged, among other things, that the lower court erred in holding that there was a necessity for the easement across his properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company ran two lumber mills and owned nearby timberlands. The company, wishing to haul logs from the timberlands to the mills, brought two private condemnation actions under Or. Rev.

The lower court granted the easement, and the owner appealed. On consolidated appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the owner was not entitled under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 or Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3 to a jury trial on the alleged ground that a jury was needed to determine the issue of necessity in a private condemnation action, because the issue was a question of law. The company's status as a private party had no bearing because Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 allowed private parties to acquire logging road easements through condemnation. The lower court's finding of necessity was proper because it was shown that the logging road was safer and less costly than an alternative road. The term &quot;necessary&quot; under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 was held to mean &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; as used in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 376.510, which was enacted to implement &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the principle of res judicata underlying Or. Rev.

The court found nothing in the record to indicate that the issues raised in the second petition could not have been presented in the first petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad sought review of an ex parte order of the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), which directed the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus commanding the railroad to comply with various orders of respondent Public Utility Commissioner of Oregon. The Commissioner's orders required the railroad to render service as a common carrier of passengers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad could not contest the validity of the order of the commissioner in the proceeding. The statutory procedure set forth in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 760.580-760.595 was intended to be the exclusive method of testing the validity of the commissioner's order. Although a court order under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.110 et seq. or Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 760.027, enforcing an order of the commissioner pending review, might have conflicted with a stay of the commissioner's order granted pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 760.585, a stay, if granted, would take precedence over the enforcement order. Thus, a writ of mandamus or an enforcement order made pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 760.027 would have been effective until the validity of the commissioner's order was determined in a review proceeding or until a stay was granted by the reviewing court. The review procedure did not violate the railroad's procedural or substantive due process rights. Although the court held that ex parte orders which affected property rights were not favorites of the law, notice and a hearing could have availed the railroad nothing because there was no defense which it could have legally urged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant contended that the city council's denial of the permit deprived the applicant of its constitutional rights. The court stated that the applicant had the burden of proof but not only failed utterly to prove discrimination but also failed to establish that the city council in its consideration of the application acted arbitrarily and capriciously. The court found that the objectives of Milwaukee, Or., Ordinance 481, &sect; 16, a zoning ordinance, bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city sufficient to warrant regulation by exercise of the police powers; that the city council's action in denying the applicant a permit to build a church in the residential zone at the particular place chosen because of ensuing traffic congestion with its incident hazards and annoyances was a reasonable application of the police power in behalf of the public safety and general welfare. Thus, there was no merit in the applicant's claim that the city council deprived the applicant of the use of its property without due process of law.

Only the circuit court had jurisdiction over his case and, until a determination was made after sentence was imposed as to the nature of the crime, the procedure applicable to felonies was employed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proponents filed a petition to form a zoning district.

XI, &sect; 2; (2) a smaller district was subsequently established with the former EWCZD boundary; (3) the 1957 law was ineffective in recreating the EWCZD because it did not retroactively establish the EWCZD boundary and it did not revoke the charter of the smaller zoning district; and (4) the proposed zoning district would not be created over an existing zoning district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his burglary conviction from Circuit Court, Clackamas County (Oregon), which initial sentenced defendant to the penitentiary for the maximum statutory period of five years. Within the time limited by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.040, the district attorney filed an information under the Habitual Criminal Act, &sect; 168.010 et seq. Based on defendant's admitted two prior convictions, the trial court imposed a sentence of ten years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that the court was not authorized to consider alleged errors from the burglary trial on appeal under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 168.060 from the habitual criminal proceedings judgment. Noting that defendant's appeal from his original conviction was never dismissed, the court considered his points. The court rejected defendant's contention that a directed verdict should have been entered in his favor. The uncontroverted evidence established that defendant and his accomplice had a gun, flashlight, and a hammer, which they used to cut a hole in the wall of a store. The jury was entitled to find that at least a hand carrying a flashlight was inserted through the hole, and that the jury properly resolved against defendant the issue of whether a breaking and entering occurred. The court also rejected defendant's challenges to the Habitual Criminal Act. The proceedings under the Act did not violate defendant's state constitutional rights. Although the court agreed with defendant's contention that there had been laxity in the enforcement of the Act, mere laxity was not a denial of the equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General filed a motion to dismiss the proceeding on the ground that the proceeding was an unconstitutional attempt to confer powers other than judicial upon the court. The court denied the motion to dismiss and revised the ballot title. The court found that the ballot title, as prepared by the Attorney General, did not measure up to the requirements of the statute. The five words in the title were not words by which the measure was commonly referred to or spoken of and did not express the chief purpose of the measure.

Further, the warden sought to reinstate the prior sentence on the ground that the circuit judge was without jurisdiction to change his prior sentence. The judge demurred to the alternative writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of violating &sect; 23-427, OCLA (Oregon), which, in part, allowed for imprisonment for a period of not less than one nor more than 20 years. At the time of his conviction, &sect; 23-429, OCLA (Oregon), provided, as a penalty for assault and robbery, imprisonment in the penitentiary for not less than three nor more than 15 years. Because &sect; 23-429 provided for less of a penalty for assault and robbery, the trial court determined that &sect; 23-427, OCLA, was unconstitutional to the extent that it provided a maximum penalty of 20 years for attempted assault and robbery. The issue was whether a trial court that passed sentence in accordance with the powers granted by statute and execution thereof had commenced court retain jurisdiction in the original action to reconsider the constitutionality of the statutory punishment. The demurrer to the alternative writ of mandamus was overruled and the writ was ordered to issue. An allegedly excessive sentence was voidable, not void, and the trial court lost jurisdiction after the sentence was issued. The inmate's remedy, if any, was by habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The utility district also filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility district argued that as a quasi-municipal corporation it was immune from liability for the torts alleged in the complaint. On appeal, the court held that a quasi-municipal corporation was not liable in tort unless a statute imposed liability. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.320 imposed tort liability on a quasi-municipal corporation when it acted in a private, corporate, or proprietary capacity. The court found that the functions of the utility district were proprietary. It held that the utility district was subject to liability. The statute made no distinction between the liability of cities and other public corporations when acting in a proprietary capacity, and the court found no reason to create a distinction by judicial construction. A utility district may be composed of a city or of a city with a parcel of unincorporated territory. The court noted that it would be strange to hold a city liable when it operated a utility and to exempt from liability a quasi-municipal corporation when engaged in the same activity, particularly if the quasi-municipal corporation included a city. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that, because the facts of the case clearly showed that defendant had used a false name and address to obtain treatment in the course of which narcotic drugs were prescribed, there had been a violation of ORS 475.060 that constituted a misdemeanor. The court further determined that, because the indictment was capable of sustaining a conviction for a misdemeanor under the provisions of ORS 475.060, merely procuring a prescription calling for a narcotic by using a false name or address could not have been a felony in violation of ORS 474.170.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Port Commissioners (Commissioners), the port sought to condemn approximately 168 acres of land belonging to the property owners. The trial court found for the property owners based on its finding that the port was attempting to condemn an area of property in excess of its needs and that a large portion of the property sought was to be used for other than public purposes, namely, leasing. The port appealed. The court reversed the judgment. Although leasing was one of the powers of the port which was enumerated in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 777.130, it did not follow that the port would attempt to exercise all of the many enumerated powers granted. Since the proposed condemnation could have been upheld on the basis of the uses expressly approved in the resolution, the right to lease was not a necessary element in the port's case. The port's proposed taking was for a public use. Moreover, in determining the amount of land to be taken the Commission was entitled to consider probable future needs as well as those of the present. In view of the evidence received, the Commission in resolving that such acreage was necessary did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

The claimant alleged that the Act discriminated unconstitutionally in favor of a workman who was injured through the negligence of one who was not subject to the Act because it did not allow him, an injured party, to recover from the corporation, a third party that was subject to the Act. The circuit court entered judgment against the claimant. The court affirmed, holding that the claimant was barred from maintaining an action under the Act because the corporation's supplemental answer stated facts sufficient to raise the issue of immunity under the Act. The court further stated that it could not conclude that the legislature acted irrationally in drawing a line between employers subject to the Act and those who were not.</SPAN></P>

The certificates were issued on account of purported assessments levied against a tract of land which at the time of the levy was owned by the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district brought an action for foreclosure of certificates of delinquency issued and held by the district. The action was brought against the city and the state. The certificates were issued on account of purported assessments levied against land which, at the time of the levy, was owned by the United States. Subsequent to the making of the assessments, the land was acquired by the city and the state. The United States refused to pay the assessments during the time it owned the land. Shortly after the United States completed a housing project on the land, it conveyed the land to the city and the state, whereupon the district commenced its action to foreclose. Under state law, the city and state were required to pay assessments made by the district. The court held that the United States was exempt from taxation by the state or its subdivisions under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The court further concluded that special assessments constituted taxes and that the United States never gave its consent to be taxed. Therefore, since the assessments were void when made, the subsequent acquisition of the property by the city and the state could not revive the void assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the driver in his action for injuries sustained in a collision. The trial court granted defendants a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that the driver's own testimony established that he was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. On appeal, the court held that the facts respecting the driver's speed, control, and brakes did not utteringly point to negligence on the part of the driver and, therefore, the issues were properly determinable by the jury. Although a judgment to reinstate the verdict would have been a normal conclusion, the court held that a new trial was necessary because the required nine jurors of out 12 jurors did not agree on the verdict as required by Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17.355(1). The evidence showed that while nine jurors agreed on liability, the ninth juror did not clearly agree on awarding the determined amount of damages. As such, the verdict was invalid. Because the verdict was a general verdict, it was a pronouncement on all issues and the trial court should have treated it as a verdict only supported by eight jurors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the applicant's application for admission to the bar. Its ruling rested primarily on the court's belief that the applicant testified falsely under oath regarding his membership with the Communist Party.

The applicant denied under oath that the Communist Party advocated the overthrow of the government by force and violence and also denied that he shared its aims. The court, however, found that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that the Communist Part's character and aims included the violent overthrow of the government. The court took judicial notice of the fact that during the years 1946-1949, when the applicant was a member of the Communist Party, it was a subversive organization which was on Russia's side in the &quot;cold war,&quot; and not, as the applicant would have had the court believe, merely a political party with a mission to make America, by the use of democratic processes, a more perfect democracy.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the governor's statutory duties with respect to the allowance of good time credits did not restrict the pardon power vested in the governor under Or. Const. art. V, &sect; 14. Because the governor did not exercise or intend to exercise the pardon power, the governor was not required to comply with the statutory provisions concerning pardons, and the prisoner could not be deemed to have been pardoned.

He attempted to revive his action by filing a claim for aggravation of the alleged injury, but the same was refused. He applied for a rehearing, which was denied, and for a second rehearing. The court denied the second petition for rehearing. The court held that despite the arguments from the claimant's counsel regarding the constitutionality of various statutes, the court did not need to pass upon the constitutionality of the review provisions of the Occupational Disease Law because the action was commenced as an appeal under the Workmen's Compensation Law. The court held that the commission could not consider a petition for aggravation without first determining that it was error to deny the claim for compensation, but because the appeal for that denial had passed, the commission could not make that determination.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued orders that restrained the commissioners from exercising any powers, that restrained the assessment and collection of taxes on behalf of the district, and that restrained the payment of any warrants issued or drawn by the district. Defendants sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's findings that &sect; 215.260 was unconstitutional as in conflict with Or. Const. art. II, &sect; 2. The court held that the election held pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 215.260 was void and that the purported county zoning district was, therefore, without any legal validity.

The court determined that its holding that the circuit court was without jurisdiction of the attempted appeal from the decisions of the Workmen's Compensation Commission had to be adhered to. The court observed that if the employee had a right to file a claim for aggravation of an occupational disease, his only appeal from an order of the Commission denying such a claim was to a medical board of review under ORS 656.810 to 656.814, and it pointed out that he had taken no such appeal. The court stated that nothing could be clearer than that the legislature did not intend that a dissatisfied claimant under the Occupational Disease Law should have a right of appeal from an order of the Commission to the circuit court with a jury trial de novo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local distributor was arrested for violating a city ordinance requiring a license for soliciting orders for merchandise. Plaintiffs filed an action contesting the validity of the ordinance, contending that the penal section of the ordinance violated the local distributor's constitutional rights. The court entered judgment for defendants and plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the city ordinance was invalid because it infringed upon the local distributor's property rights in violation of the Oregon and federal constitutions. The local distributor had a property right in soliciting business in the city because the business provided him with a profit and the corporation had a property interest because it won for itself valuable patronage in the city. An injunction was proper because it was reasonable to believe that the enforcement of the challenged ordinance would have had a detrimental, if not fatal, effect upon the local distributor's business. Although the penal sanction of the ordinance practically left the company unaffected, enforcement would have curtailed its power to earn profits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant filed an accident injury claim with the Commission, which treated the claim as a compensation claim for an occupational disease. After awarding the claimant compensation, the Commission terminated the compensation and closed the claim. Thereafter, the claimant filed an aggravation claim. After the claim's denial, the claimant appealed to the circuit court, which dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In affirming, the court held that under the Occupational Disease Law, the only appeal was to a medical board. Under the Workmen's Compensation Law, which authorized an appeal to a circuit court, the court held that an aggravation claim could be filed within two years from the date of the first final award of compensation or if there was no such award, within two years of the order allowing the claim. The court held that the aforementioned conditions were completely wanting because there had been no award of any description under the Workmen's Compensation Law nor had the claim under that law been allowed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Tax Commission of the State of Oregon, appealed the order of the Circuit Court, Deschutes County (Oregon), which reversed the determination of the Commission that plaintiff taxpayer's Canadian income was taxable, in the taxpayer's action for an income tax refund under the tax credit statute Or. Comp. Laws. Ann. &sect; 110-1605a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned corporate stock in Canada. The Canadian corporations deducted the 15 percent Canadian tax and sent the net dividends to the taxpayer. The taxpayer paid Oregon income tax under protest. The commission rejected the taxpayer's appeal. The taxpayer sought judicial review under &sect; 110-1629. The circuit court awarded judgment to the taxpayer. The commission appealed. The court reversed. The court found that under the tax credit statute any credit was dependent upon the character of the Income War Tax Act, ch. 28, p. 171, 1917, amended by &sect; 9B, 1933 S.C. (Can.) and The Income Tax Act, vol. 1, ch. 52, p. 475, 1948 S.C. (Can.). Because the Canadian Acts had not allowed the taxpayer to claim deductions or exemptions from her gross income, it was a &quot;gross income tax.&quot; Although the dividend was once a part of the corporations' net income, both Canadian and state tax laws treated the dividends in the hands of the taxpayer as gross income. Or. Admin. R. 605a-1-a prevented the credit for taxes paid upon gross income. Therefore, the dividend deductions were only gross income taxes that were ineligible for the tax credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a people's utility district (PUD) and board members, sought a declaration that the district was not subject to property taxes for 1950-1953. Defendants, the state attorney general, a county, a county court, and county officials, and intervenor city appealed a decree from the Circuit Court, Wasco County (Oregon), which declared that the 1950 assessment was unauthorized. Plaintiffs challenged the decree upholding the other assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State Tax Commission relied in part upon 1939 Or. Laws ch. 343, &sect; 1(14) when it assessed the PUD's property for 1950. The challenged decree held that &sect; 1(14), which undertook to amend 1909 Or. Laws ch. 218, violated Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 20 inasmuch as its subject matter was not within the title of the 1909 act. It also held that 1939 Or. Laws, ch. 387, &sect; 10 did not empower the Commission to assess the PUD's property for 1950, but that &sect; 10 and 1951 Or. Laws ch. 586, &sect; 2(14) empowered the Commission to assess the property for 1951, 1952 and 1953. Finding that all the taxes were valid, the court agreed that 1939 Or. Laws ch. 343, &sect; 1(14) was unconstitutional when enacted, but held that the legislature retroactively validated the 1950 assessment when it enacted 1951 Or. Laws ch. 586, &sect; 29. The court determined that Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 12 did not impliedly prohibit the legislature from taxing PUDs and that the fact that PUD property was the only municipal or public property subject to ad valorem property taxation did not violate the uniformity requirements of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 32 and art. IX, &sect; 1 because the classification had a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the validity of the challenged taxes, reversed that part of the trial court's decree that held that the 1950 assessment was not authorized, and affirmed that part of the decree that upheld the assessments for 1951-1953.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A special election was held regarding the proposed annexation of certain property. Twenty-seven voters were not allowed to cast ballots. After the annexation proposal passed by a vote of 117 to 99, the challengers filed a declaratory action to have the special election declared invalid. The circuit court declared the election void after determining that the city erred when election officials attempted to administer an oath of voter eligibility different from that set out in ORS 250.390. The city appealed. In reversing, the court concluded that, even though the city erred in requiring the voters to take an oath regarding their eligibility other than that expressly set forth in ORS 250.390, they were nevertheless disqualified from casting a ballot because they had not registered to vote at least 30 days before the election. The election was not void solely because unqualified voters were wrongfully denied the right to cast ballots. Put another way, if only qualified electors in fact voted, an election was valid even though unqualified voters were illegally prevented from casting ballots.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the ban against women wrestlers did not constitute an unreasonable exercise of the police power of the state and did not violate U.S. Const. art. XIV and Or. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The court held that the classification contained in the statute was based upon a reasonable distinction having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation and, therefore, was constitutional. The court found that there was no inherent right to engage in public exhibitions of boxing and wrestling. The court held that it did not need to decide whether any portion of the statute constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, because even if it did, it would not effect the validity of the portion of the statute under which defendant was being prosecuted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court knew of the appeal of the circuit court's dismissal of appellant's habeas corpus action only because the State filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.

Appellant filed a motion seeking an order authorizing the circuit court to direct the county treasurer to post an undertaking for appellant. Attached to the motion was an affidavit stating that appellant was indigent. In denying the State's motion to dismiss, the court ruled that it was without authority to direct the posting of an undertaking. It was required, however, under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution to waive the undertaking requirement. The United States Supreme Court had previously declared that indigent criminal defendants were entitled to transcripts on appeal. The court reasoned that the United States Supreme Court would also have found that a pauper who claimed that he was imprisoned under a void judgment would be entitled under the Equal Protection Clause to the waiver of the requirement of a bond for costs if such waiver was necessary to the presentation of his appeal.</SPAN></P>

The State petitioned the court to require the judge to discharge the county grand jury. The judge filed a demurrer on the ground that the petition did not state facts sufficient to warrant the issuance of the writ. The court sustained the demurrer. The court held that Or. Rev.

Over two years later, defendant filed a petition in coram nobis in which he sought an order from the trial court vacating the sentence imposed upon him. Defendant claimed that his guilty plea was brought about by fraud and misrepresentation. At the time defendant's petition in coram nobis was considered, he had completed his criminal sentence. The trial court denied defendant's petition in coram nobis and held that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain this petition. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court stated that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider defendant's petition in coram nobis even though defendant was no longer serving his sentence. The court noted that had the trial court determined that the allegations within defendant's petition were meritless, a question would arise as to the jurisdiction of the court on appeal. Due to the fact that the trial court refused to consider defendant's petition, however, the court remanded the case to the trial court to consider the sufficiency of the allegations raised by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Manufacturer produced appliances, which were sold under a well-known trademark and marketed through a national advertising campaign. Manufacturer regulated the retail sale of its trademarked products by fixing minimum prices at which they could be sold. Over 200 retailers in Oregon had signed a contract agreeing to sell manufacturer's products at the fixed prices. Although retailer had not signed the contract, it was aware of its terms. Pursuant to the Fair Trade Act (Act), manufacturer sought to enforce the minimum prices against retailer. The court found that federal law on the subject matter was unclear and decided the case with reference to the state constitution, Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20 and 21. The court found that the Act unreasonably interfered with retailer's right to contract. The court held that the police power was not properly exercised because protecting the goodwill of a trademark owner was not based upon considerations of public welfare. The court held that the Act also contained an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to fix prices to private corporations.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled the First Amendment right to freedom of religion was subject to reasonable restraints imposed for the general welfare.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wrongful possessors appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Malheur County (Oregon), which granted plaintiff horse owner's motion for judgment upon the pleadings in the owner's replevin action. The owner's demurrer to the possessors' affirmative defense under the horse roundup statute (roundup act), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 607.4050-607.435 was sustained, because the possessors did not state facts sufficient to constitute a proper defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought repossession of his horses, colts, and mules. The complaint contained the usual allegations regarding replevin. The answer admitted ownership and alleged that prior to being rounded up the horses had been running at large upon the public domain for weeks and roundup charges were incurred with respect to the roundup act, &sect;&sect; 607.405-607.435, which the owner argued was unconstitutional and void and the trial court agreed. The possessors contended that the horses were running at large without a license or permit; that they were trespassing in violation of the Taylor Grazing Act, 43 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 315 to 315r; and that they were a nuisance, where police power could be exercised to summarily dispose of the horses without notice or compensation. On appeal, the roundup act was found unconstitutional, in that it constituted an unreasonable and arbitrary interference with rights to private property without due process of law in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Or. Const. art. 1, &sect; 18. The roundup act was also improper because it allowed an arbitrary determination by a brand inspector amounting to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of the habitual offender charge. The trial court set aside the sentence for the firearms conviction and imposed a sentence of 15 years in the penitentiary. Defendant contended that the Oregon Habitual Criminal Act was unconstitutional as applied in his case. The court held that the portion of the Act that gave a district attorney unlimited authority to proceed or not to proceed at all against a convicted felon in personal, nonviolent cases was unconstitutional. There was no yardstick or semblance of classification which would enable the district attorney to determine under what circumstances an information should be filed. The exercise of an absolute discretion was vested in the district attorney in such a circumstance. The fate of persons, even to the extent of life imprisonment, who had committed the same acts under the same circumstances and in like situations was determined by the whim and caprice of the district attorney.</SPAN></P>

In acquitting the defendant, the trial court held that &sect; 163.090 was unconstitutional under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court also held that the indictment failed to charge defendant with the commission of a crime. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.090 was constitutional. The indictment was valid even though it charged defendant and the co-defendant with only one crime that could be committed by only one of them at a given time. The indictment was sufficient under Or.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with negligent homicide pursuant to &sect; 163.090 for proximately causing the death of a victim by operating a motor vehicle in a negligent manner, including failing to obey a traffic signal or to give due regard to the traffic, surface, and width of the highway. Defendant demurred to the indictment, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 163.090 under the Fourteenth Amendment and under Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 11, 15, and Or. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The circuit court sustained defendant's demurrer to the indictment, holding that the indictment did not charge the commission of a crime. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the circuit court. The word &quot;negligence&quot; was defined in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.010 as importing a want of such attention to the nature or probable consequences of an act or omission that a prudent man ordinarily would bestow. Therefore, the negligent homicide statute was of sufficient clarity that a person who violated it would know that his act was criminal when he committed it. The statute was not vague and did not deprive defendant of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment or the Oregon Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant trucking company appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon) that was rendered for plaintiff railroad in the railroad's action to recover damages sustained by it in a collision between one of its trains and a truck owned by the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident occurred as the company's truck attempted to cross the train's tracks. The railroad claimed that the company was negligent in not having its truck under control, in failing to keep a proper lookout, in failing to heed the warning signals, in driving its truck on the tracks, and in failing to yield the right of way. The company claimed that the train was moving at an excessive speed, contrary to Salem, Or., Ordinance No. 2566. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court ruled that the city's ordinance, as well as other cities' ordinances, was repealed by implication by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 760.050, which vested the state exclusively with the power to fix and regulate the speed of railway trains within the limits of cities and towns of less than 100,000 population. The statute was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and authority, in that the legislature established the guides and standards for the public utilities commissioner to use in fixing such speeds. Despite that they were not properly presented for review, under Or. R. Civ. P. 13, the court considered the company's other assignments of error and ruled that they were meritless.</SPAN></P>
