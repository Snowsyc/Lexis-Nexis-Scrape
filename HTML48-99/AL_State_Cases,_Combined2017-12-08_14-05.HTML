</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought a liability action. The jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages to the plaintiff. The defendants appealed, contending that the jury's verdict was excessive. The court found that the punitive damages awarded were not excessive, but that the compensatory damages awarded to two of the plaintiffs were excessive. The court reviewed the record and found that defendants proved that the maximum of compensatory damages for one of the defendants was $ 5,671.66. The court was also convinced that the jury's apportionment of the compensatory damages was supported by the evidence. The court therefore held that the compensatory damages awards should have been respectively reduced by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landfill owner filed an action challenging the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect; 22-30B-1 et seq. and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) ruled that the act's provisions imposing additional fees on waste generated out-of-state were unconstitutional, but that the act was otherwise constitutional. Both the landfill owner and the state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landfill owner operated the only hazardous waste landfill facility in the state. The legislature enacted Ala. Code &sect; 22-30B-1 et seq. because it found that an excessive amount of hazardous waste generated out-of-state was being brought into the state and buried at the landfill. The act included provisions imposing a base fee on all waste disposed of at commercial facilities regardless of the state of origin and imposing an additional fee on all waste generated outside the state and disposed of at in-state facilities. The landfill owner claimed that the act violated the Commerce Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and other provisions of the federal and state constitutions. The court held that the act was constitutional. In so holding, the court ruled that (1) the act did not violate the Commerce Clause because the additional fees imposed on waste generated out-of-state served legitimate local purposes that could not adequately be served by available nondiscriminatory alternatives; and (2) the act's provisions were rationally related to legitimate state interests and therefore did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's ruling that the act's provisions imposing additional fees on waste generated out-of-state were unconstitutional, but affirmed its ruling that the act was otherwise constitutional and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed a judgment of the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of defendant city officials in an action alleging that the officials conspired to deprive the owner of the use and enjoyment of its property without due process of law. The owner contended the court erred in granting the officials' motion for summary judgment based on the defenses of absolute and qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sued various city officials in their individual capacities, alleging that they conspired to deprive it of the use and enjoyment of its property without due process of law by failing to approve its plan to excavate a public roadway. The owner sought to recover both compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The officials filed a motion for a summary judgment, raising the defenses of absolute and qualified immunity. The trial court granted their motion. On review, the owner claimed the court erred in granting the officials' motion based on those defenses. The appellate court noted that absolute immunity is extended to municipal government officials performing legislative functions. However, the court concluded that although the city officials passed a resolution stating that the roadway could not be excavated until an ownership issue was resolved, the resolution was not legislative in nature. Accordingly, the mayor and members of the town council were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the defense of absolute immunity. The court noted that generally only qualified immunity is extended to such executive or administrative functions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the grant of summary judgment as to the mayor and members of the town council because they were only entitled to qualified immunity for their executive or administrative functions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the doctor was not a specialist with in the meaning of Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-548(c) because he failed to meet all three criteria. The court concluded that the witness offered by the administrator was a &quot;similarly situated health care provider&quot; for purposes of Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant submitted an application for rehearing in the capital murder case presented earlier to the court on appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama). Defendant was convicted of murder during a robbery in the first degree in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975), and the death penalty was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant submitted an application for rehearing of the decision that upheld the appeals court's affirmance of his conviction for murder during a robbery in the first degree in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(2) (1975). The court first held that a recent United States Supreme Court decision required reversal of the portion of the judgment concluding that defendant, who was white, lacked standing to bring a third-party claim under the Equal Protection Clause on behalf of black jurors subject to the prosecutor's allegedly racially motivated peremptory strikes. The court remanded the issue to the trial court for a hearing and directed that a new trial would follow if the prosecutors did not provide racially neutral reasons for the juror challenges. The court then found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting photographs and slides portraying the victim at the guilt and the sentencing trials. Further, the court rejected defendant's numerous claims of improper trial court rulings. The court granted the application for rehearing on the juror challenge claim, substituted the opinion for the earlier decision, and affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court withdrew the original opinion and in the new decision affirmed the remainder of the appeals court judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment as to the hospital's chief executive officer but affirmed the judgment as to the director of mental health and the nurse. The court found that the fact that the decedent was alone in the bathroom for an extended period of time was a strong indication that the policies or customs of the hospital regarding patient safety were below the standard of care as implemented and maintained. As such, the court found that the decedent's estate should have been permitted to prove its allegations regarding the hospital's chief executive officer's exercise of judgment with respect to policy promulgation and implementation. However, because neither the director of mental health nor the nurse was responsible for the implementation or promulgation of policies, the court found that summary judgment was appropriate with respect to the claims against them.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice on the ground that the action had not been timely filed pursuant to &sect;&sect; 6-5-570 et seq. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court reviewed only the issue of whether the trial court applied the correct statute of limitations. The court held that the statute of limitations, which was generally viewed as remedial, applied retrospectively. The court held that the statute of limitations in effect at the time the suit was filed applied, rather than the one in effect at the time of the accrual of the cause of action. The court found that the clients' claim was barred under &sect; 6-5-574(a) because they failed to file their claim within two years after the accrual of their cause of action. The court held that the time limits in the LSLA were to be measured from the date of the accrual of the cause of action and not from the date of the occurrence of the act or omission. The court held that the legislature intended that the one year given by the saving provision in &sect; 6-5-574(a) was to be measured from the &quot;effective date&quot; of the LSLA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee of an inter vivos trust filed an action for a declaratory judgment and alleged that the trust agreement provided that the net income from the corpus of the trust be paid in equal shares to the settlor's three children during their respective lifetimes, or, upon the death of a child, to the &quot;lawful issue of the body&quot; of such child for his or her lifetime. The complaint further alleged that one of the settlor's children died on the record date for the payment of a stock dividend to the trust. The trustee, therefore, sought instructions as to whether, under the terms of the trust, the beneficiary's estate or the successor beneficiaries were entitled to the dividend and whether future income should be paid solely to the beneficiary's son or should be divided equally between the son and an adopted daughter. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, finding that the beneficiary's estate was entitled to the dividend payable to the shareholders of record and that the trial court correctly instructed the trustee to divide one-third of the future net income from the trust equally between the beneficiary's natural son and the beneficiary's adopted daughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment by the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted defendant Huntsville-Madison County Airport Authority's (airport) motion to dismiss plaintiff's claim for damages for a slip and fall that occurred while he was at the airport. The trial court found that 1961 Ala. Acts 780, as amended by 1969 Ala. Acts 1219, (Act) provided the airport with immunity for acts of negligence and wantonness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit for injuries he suffered from a slip and fall that occurred while at the airport and asserted a claim based on negligence and wantonness against the airport. The trial court granted the airport's motion to dismiss on the basis that the airport was immune under the Act from plaintiff's tort action. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case. Plaintiff argued that the Act denied him due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ala. Const. art I, &sect; 13, because it provided immunity for wanton acts by airports in counties with high populations and no such immunity existed for airports operated in counties with lower populations. The court found that although both types of airports had immunity for negligent acts, a distinction existed for wanton acts. The court determined that the Act created a classification that did not involve a suspect class or fundamental right and applied a rational basis standard for reviewing plaintiff's claim. The court could not discern a rational basis for the classification and found unconstitutional the portion of the Act providing immunity to the airport for torts other than negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found unconstitutional the provision of the Act that provided the airport immunity as to torts other than negligence. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment to dismiss plaintiff's negligence action, reversed the trial court's judgment to dismiss plaintiff's claim alleging wantonness, and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney contended that the board acted unconstitutionally in interpreting Ala. Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 2-103 to allow it to punish him for conduct that the bar had previously and repeatedly approved in published ethics opinions and that the he had not engaged in any &quot;in-person&quot; solicitation. The court affirmed the board's decision, as the attorney violated the purpose and spirit of DR 2-103 by sending a letter that was attached to a funeral arrangement to the family of a deceased child inviting them to contact his office for assistance. The court concluded that the attorney's indifference to the purpose and spirit of the DR 2-103 constituted an independent basis to support a DR 1-102(A)(6) violation. The court found that DR 1-102(A)(6) clearly put the attorney on notice to exercise great discretion so as not to engage in conduct that would adversely reflect on his fitness to practice law. The court concluded that the two-year suspension for the attorney's failure to submit a brochure describing his firm's services for the bar's approval under DR 2-102(B) and his violation of the other two disciplinary rules was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The car's wheel detached as the result of the alleged negligence of the corporation's employee. Plaintiffs cross-appealed alleging the statute regarding future damages was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's business was a convenience store that sold gas, but did not employ a mechanic or repair cars. The employee assisted the owner of the car by changing her flat tire. Plaintiffs contended the employee was an agent for the corporation and that he negligently changed the tire and that negligence was the proximate cause of their injuries. The court reversed, finding that plaintiffs were required to submit substantial evidence in support of each element of their claim under Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-12 (1975). The court held plaintiffs did not establish a duty and a breach of duty because proof of an accident and injury did not establish negligence. The court found there was no physical evidence regarding the employee's negligence because the car had been vandalized while in storage and any finding of negligence was based on speculation. Further no one saw the employee act negligently and there was no expert testimony offered. The court concluded that the employee's deposition supported the corporation's claim and that the employee's inadvertent omission regarding tightening the lug nuts with a lug wrench was quickly corrected. The court held plaintiffs' cross-appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured sued for damages for breach of contract and fraud when the insurance company refused to pay certain claims made on her health and hospitalization policy, claiming the right of coordination of benefits.

The jury found in her favor and awarded punitive damages at $ 1 million. The trial judge reduced that award on the grounds that the insured could not recover more than she had asked for in the complaint. The insurance company had filed a cross-appealed claiming that the punitive damages award was improper. The court disagreed and reversed because the trial judge erroneously reduced the verdict due to his misunderstanding of the applicable law. Further, the record was devoid of any evidence that would have justified interfering with the verdict under the criteria established that these awards be reduced only when they excessive or improperly motivated.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-11-23(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed upon the power of the trial court to determine how much deference to give a jury verdict; and (3) &sect; 24(a) unconstitutionally infringed upon the appellate court's scope of review of a trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for the trial court to reconsider the verdict in light of the appropriate presumption of correctness of the jury verdict and in accordance with state precedent.</SPAN></P>

The father asked for a declaration that any proceeds received by the mother in an underlying wrongful death action had be distributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution as provided for in Ala. Code &sect; 43-84-42.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the parties' judgment of divorce, the mother was awarded custody. Their minor son was killed in an automobile accident, and as the custodial parent, the mother filed a wrongful death action and received a settlement. At the time of the son's death, the father had obligations for his support, maintenance, and education. Those obligations included child support, all medical and dental expenses, and life insurance on his own life that named the son as a beneficiary. The father claimed that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-390 (1979) did not intend that the damages recovered in a parent's wrongful death action had to be distributed only to the parent authorized to bring the action. He contended that, although the mother as custodial parent had the exclusive right to bring the action, she did not have the exclusive right to the proceeds. The trial court ruled that the mother was entitled to all of the proceeds. The court affirmed. It was undisputed that the father and mother were divorced. Therefore, the mother as custodial parent had the exclusive right to bring the wrongful death action and the exclusive right to any recovery.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 13A-8-50 - 13A-8-52 (1975). A trial court sentenced defendant to 10 years in prison. Defendant was denied his petition for post-conviction relief under Ala. R. Crim. P. 20, which alleged the statute was unconstitutional because it was not enacted pursuant to constitutional requirements. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under a new statute that was not properly enacted under Ala. Const. &sect; 125, which required the governor to deposit a bill that he approved with the secretary of state within 10 days. The court held that &sect; 125 was mandatory, and any law not deposited pursuant to the constitutional provision was deemed pocket vetoed. The court further held that a bill adopting a cumulative supplement did not serve to enact the provisions of a pocket-vetoed bill. It only served to systematize validly enacted laws into the structure of the Alabama Code. The court found that the legislature, to enact the provisions of a vetoed bill, had to follow the requirements of all applicable constitutional provisions, including Ala. Const. &sect; 45, which required all laws be divided by subject. In affirming defendant's conviction, however, the court held that its holding in the instant matter was prospective only because to hold otherwise would invalidate hundreds of laws that Alabamans relied upon for years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment that denied defendant post-conviction relief. However, the court held that future statutes that were not deposited within 10 days with the secretary of state were to be deemed pocket vetoed. The court held that a bill adopting a cumulative supplement did not serve to enact the provisions of a pocket-vetoed bill.</SPAN></P>

The administrator filed a wrongful death action against the power company. The jury found the power company negligent and awarded the administrator $ 5 million dollars in damages. On appeal, the court affirmed on the condition that the administrator accept a remittitur of $ 1.5 million resulting in a judgment in favor of the administrator in the amount of $ 3.5 million. The court concluded that punitive damages awards under Alabama's wrongful death statutes do not violate the Eighth Amendment. The court also concluded that the power company's substantive due process rights were not violated and that Alabama's wrongful death statute was not unconstitutional. The court found a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest in the exception of wrongful death actions from statutory caps on punitive damages awarded in civil actions.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the out-of-state national banks holding that the excise tax could not be levied against them. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that because the state's financial institution excise tax was enacted at a time when the state was prohibited by federal law from taxing out-of-state national banks, and the legislature was aware of the federal law when the tax was enacted, it was not the legislature's intent to impose the tax on out-of-state national banks.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff recovered against the tortfeasor, and defendant sought to enforce its right to subrogation. The circuit court held the insurer was entitled to recover the full amount it paid for medical expenses. The court reversed. The court held that the right of subrogation, whether equitable or contractual, did not arise until an insured had been fully compensated for his or her loss.

The court held that, in the absence of express restrictions, the attorney general was vested with the power to control all litigation involving state and public interests, including the dismissal, abandonment, and compromise of state litigation. The court found that 1) the attorney general was not prohibited from representing both sides in an action; 2) the commissioner had not been denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment, as he was party to the action as the commissioner of insurance, not as an individual; and 3) although the attorney general had the power to move to dismiss the Department's case, the governor of the state had the right to intervene and take a position contrary to that of the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

The construction firm filed a petition for a writ of mandamus pursuant to Ala. R. Civ. P. 21(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator filed a wrongful death action against the construction firm alleging that a slope abutting the highway at the intersection where the accident occurred in which the decedent died had been constructed in a negligent or wanton manner so as to obstruct the vision of the automobile driver. The action was filed in the county where the administrator resided, not the county where the accident occurred. The construction firm filed a motion for change of venue. The trial court denied the motion. The construction firm filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. The court denied the writ. The court held that Ala. Code &sect; 6-3-7 (1975) required a wrongful death action, brought by the personal representative, be brought in the county where the injury occurred or in the county where the personal representative resided, provided the corporation did business there. The construction firm's home office and the business offices of many of the witnesses were in the county where the action was brought. The court held the construction firm did not meet its burden to show a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrator of a decedent's estate, the decedent having been killed at the workplace, filed a wrongful death action against his employer and, because he challenged the constitutionality of a statute, named the attorney general as a party. The administrator alleged that the exclusive remedy aspect of the Worker's Compensation Act, Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-52, 53, was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the claim against the employer and granted summary judgment in favor of the attorney general. The administrator appealed. The court found that, under the rational basis analysis required under an Equal Protection claim, there was a rational basis for limiting benefits of those decedents without dependants because there existed a legitimate state interest in only providing for those who were dependent on the decedent's salary. As to the claim that Ala. Const., Art I &sect;&sect; 1, 13 were violated, the court found that because a wrongful death action was statutory, the legislation would only be invalid if arbitrary or capricious, which the statute at issue was not. The judgement of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor contended that the disincentive clause of each contract was void as a penalty and therefore was unenforceable, and requested that the trial court order appellees to pay the contractor the amounts of disincentive payments that appellees withheld. Applying a three-part test to the case, the court found that the disincentive clause at issue clearly constituted a penalty and consequently, was void as a matter of public policy. The court determined (1) that in each contract, the amount of injury caused by delay had already been determined, assessed, and withheld; (2) that the contractor bid on the projects with the disincentive clause included as part of the bid documents, not as a negotiated term or condition; and (3) that the disincentive clause did not compensate for the injury that occurred, but rather attempted to coerce performance and resulted in disproportionate, unreasonable compensation. Such a purpose was penal in nature and was therefore invalid. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to declare the disincentive clause void as a penalty and thus, unenforceable. Hence, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees.</SPAN></P>

He petitioned the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama) for a writ of certiorari on grounds that he did not consent to searches, did not voluntarily give statements, did not have effective assistance of counsel, and that the prosecution had unfairly commented during closing on his failure to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for unlawful possession of a handgun and waived his Miranda rights. When police questioning turned to a murder, defendant asked for an attorney, and questioning ceased until court-appointed counsel spoke to him and advised him not to consent to searches if he was involved with the murder. The defendant gave his consent and circumstantial evidence was found. He approached the police officers, asked to speak, and voluntarily admitted to unintentionally strangling the woman. On appeal, the court found that he had voluntarily given his statement, validly consented to searches, and received effective assistance of counsel under the Strickland test. Because he used the insanity defense, the state could introduce its own psychiatric testimony and compel him to undergo a psychiatric exam. The district attorney's comments during closing argument upon the defendant's failure to testify were grounds for reversible error because the defense's objection, motion for a mistrial, and request for a curative instruction were overruled by the trial court. The statements violated defendant's right against self-incrimination and were not cured immediately.</SPAN></P>

The passenger's uninsured motorist carrier tendered her policy limits and was realigned as the plaintiff in the passenger's action against the son's liability insurance carrier. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the son's liability insurance carrier, and held that the uninsured motorist coverage from the son's second liability insurance policy could not be stacked, because the coverage sought to be stacked was coverage of a separate vehicle not involved in the collision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lumber company filed a materialman's lien action against defendant mortgage company in the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama) and obtained a default judgment. The mortgage company filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, which was denied. The mortgage company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that: (1) at the time when the materials were furnished by the lumber company, the mortgage company's mortgage was on record; (2) the lumber company properly perfected its materialman's lien, but it was inferior to the mortgage company's mortgage; and (3) because after the mortgage company's foreclosure there were no surplus proceeds, the only remedy or recourse left to the lumber company was the right to redeem under Ala. Code &sect; 35-11-2. Therefore, the mortgage company had established a meritorious defense and satisfied the first threshold prerequisite for setting aside the default judgment. The court further held that the lumber company would not have been unfairly prejudiced if the default judgment were set aside, and that the mortgage company had set forth a reasonable explanation for its inaction and, thus, had precluded a finding of culpability on its part. The court concluded that the mortgage company had met the three-part test for the setting aside of the default judgment and that it should have received its day in court. Therefore, the trial court's refusal to set aside the default judgment was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court, which was instructed to set aside the default judgment and to allow the mortgage company a reasonable time in which to file its answer, and to proceed in a manner consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's child was born with an enlarged left ureter, an inguinal hernia, and an umbilical hernia. A urologist referred the child to defendant doctor for surgical repair of the hernias. After the doctor operated on him, the baby developed a high fever and it was discovered that he had septicemia. The doctor performed exploratory surgery two days later and discovered that the left ureter was caught in the area he had sutured. In attempting to dislodge the ureter, the doctor inadvertently tore it. The baby died the next morning. The mother filed a successful action against the doctor. On appeal, the court rejected the doctor's argument that there was a lack of standards governing the awarding of punitive damages in wrongful death actions, and that this lack of standards deprived him of due process. The court noted that it had previously rejected such an argument. The court also found that there was no prejudicial error in the trial judge's charge instructing the jury to credit any award to two other doctors who had settled with the mother and to apply the remaining balance to the mother. The court reasoned that it was for the jury to determine whether the mother was to recover.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 22-27-5(b) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county authorized the waste company to operate a solid waste landfill without conducting a hearing. Thereafter, the county rescinded the resolutions authorizing the landfill without conducting a hearing. The waste company filed a formal permit application with the state department of environmental management (DEM) pursuant to &sect; 22-27-5(b), and filed an action alleging constitutional and other violations. The court reversed the appellate court's reversal of the grant of summary judgment to defendants. The court found that the Solid Wastes Disposal Act, Ala. Code &sect; 22-27-1 et seq., was not unconstitutionally vague and capricious because of a failure to establish specific guidelines and criteria for the issuance of waste permits, as the Act gave local and county governments much guidance in formulating reasonable standards to utilize in the licensing process established by the Act. The court held that the waste company's original license should not have been issued without notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The court held that the county was entitled to adopt license requirements for landfills that required the waste company to first procure a permit from DEM.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the county's contention that some of the annexations failed for lack of contiguity.

The court also rejected the county's contention that one of the municipalities' method of annexation was unreasonable. The court held that the law did not require that boundaries formed a regular shape so long as there was oneness and a community of interest in the area annexed. The court held that the municipality had a legitimate interest in protecting the area annexed. The court reversed the finding that the annexation of one of the municipalities was valid, holding that the long lasso annexation by one of the municipalities was invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personnel board brought a declaratory judgment action seeking to have 1988 Ala. Acts 88-897 declared unconstitutional. The police union, in intervening, sought the reinstatement of a board program and the uniform maintenance allowance, petitioning for a writ of mandamus directing the county commission to comply with 1988 Ala. Acts 88-897. The trial court, after realignment of parties and appeal, filed a final order declaring 1988 Ala. Act. 88-897 unconstitutional, and the parties sought review. On appeal, the court held that because the subject matter of the compensation of the officers was already provided for in 1945 Ala. Acts. 248, which was a general law, the legislature had no authority to pass a local act involving the same subject. The court held that 1988 Ala. Act. 88-897 violated &sect; 105 of the Alabama Constitution (1901). Therefore, the court held that 1988 Ala. Act 88-897 was unconstitutional. The court remanded the issue brought by appellees on cross appeal as to the uniform maintenance allowance, with instructions to hold further hearings and to make a ruling as to the status of that allowance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee foreign corporation challenged the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect; 40-14-41, Alabama's franchise tax on foreign corporations. The foreign corporation claimed &sect; 40-14-41 violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Commerce Clause. The trial court held that &sect; 40-14-41 violated the Equal Protection Clause and the court of civil appeals affirmed. On review, the court initially noted that state tax legislation was to be given great deference before it would be found to be in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The court reversed the decision of the court of civil appeals. The court noted that Alabama taxed domestic corporations under Ala. Code &sect; 40-14-40. This analogous provision did not provide for disparate treatment. Furthermore, the tax did not burden interstate commerce because Ala. Code &sect; 40-14-40 was a substantially equivalent tax on interstate commerce. The court thus found no unconstitutional unequal treatment of foreign corporations and no unconstitutional discrimination against them. Therefore, Ala. Code &sect; 40-14-41 did not offend either the Equal Protection Clause or the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that dismissal of the complaints was required either by Ala.

The court granted the writ of mandamus. The court held that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-430 (1975), as amended by 1987 Ala. Acts 87, required trial courts to apply the doctrine of forum non conveniens in deciding whether to exercise or decline to exercise jurisdiction over a cause of action accruing outside the state. The court stated that foreign and domestic corporate defendants were treated identically under the venue statutes and under the constitution of the State of Alabama. The court also held that where a statute was enacted in anticipation of a constitutional amendment offered simultaneously with it, and the statute and the proposed amendment were debated and considered together in the same session of the legislature, the subsequent adoption of the amendment by a vote of the people served to validate the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner ex-husband sought review of a judgment from the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama), affirming the trial court's ruling, which declared that respondent doctor was the biological father of a minor child under the Alabama Uniform parentage Act (UPA), Ala. Code &sect; 26-17-1 et seq. (1986), and awarded the ex-husband occasional visitation privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-husband and respondent mother was were married. The mother engaged in an adulterous affair with the doctor and gave birth to a child. After the couple was divorced, the mother married the doctor and filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment of paternity. Specifically, the mother and doctor requested the trial court to rule that the child was conceived and born out of wedlock and that the child was the natural child of the doctor. The legal question on review was whether the doctor had standing to bring an action seeking to declare a child illegitimate and to have himself declared the father. The court held that this was not permitted under the UPA, as long as there was a presumed father, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 26-17-5(a)(1), who had not disclaimed his status as the child's father. Consequently, the court concluded that the doctor, though he later married the mother and lived with the mother and child, had no standing to challenge the presumed paternity of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The child's mother and the deceased were divorced prior to his death on the basis of the mother's pregnancy at the time of marriage without the knowledge or agency of the deceased. According to Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-12, a divorce granted under these circumstances bastardized the child. The court held that the divorce judgment was not binding on the child, because she was not joined as a party or represented by a guardian ad litem. The court found that because the child was entitled to litigate the issue of paternity, she was entitled to the presumption that a child born to a married woman was the child of her husband. Because any other result would have violated fundamental principles of fairness and due process, the court held that because the child was not represented by a guardian ad litem, nor given an opportunity to prove that the deceased was her father, &sect; 30-2-12 was unconstitutional as applied to the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant sought review of a judgment of the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama), which affirmed appellee city's denial of his application for a permit to construct a single-family dwelling on his property pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 11-52-35 (1975). The applicant argued that no streets were located on the plan that encompassed his property; hence, it was improper to deny the permit because his property did not access a public road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant made application to the city for a building permit in order to construct a single-family dwelling. The permit was denied and the reason indicated was that his property did not access a public road. The applicant then applied to the City Board of Adjustment for a variance, which was granted. Notwithstanding this fact, he was denied a building permit on the grounds that it would be a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 11-52-35 (1975). Section 11-52-35 was not as inflexible as the city contended. To hold that the statute prevented the applicant from building on his property in any way would deny his constitutional and common-law right to use his property in a reasonable manner. The applicant was originally granted a variance that allowed him to build his single-family dwelling. To allow absolutely no room for variances where dictated by hardship would force the court to hold &sect; 11-52-35&nbsp;unconstitutional. Because the court was bound to construe the statute as constitutional if possible, it concluded that the city might provide for variances in cases such as the applicant's where there was obvious hardship. Hence, the building permit should have been issued.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant's petition was procedurally barred. The petition was barred under Rules 20.2(a)(3) and 20.2(a)(5) because it was a ground that could have been but was not raised at trial or on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A negligence action was filed by parents of a child injured at a state-run day care facility. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss as to worker A, the director of the facility, and granted a motion for summary judgment based on sovereign immunity as to worker B who provided inspections. Upon review, a determination had to be made as to whether the action was, in effect, a claim against the state thereby affording the workers' absolute immunity under the Ala. Const. art.

The court held that the nature of the action and the relief sought were not the kind that afforded the workers absolute immunity from suit. However, as to worker A, the court held she was acting within the general scope of her authority which was a protected discretionary function thereby affording her protective immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant illegitimate child sought review of an order from the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted summary judgment to appellees, administratrix, administrator, and sureties, on the child's third-party complaint. The child alleged an intentional, willful, fraudulent, and conspiratorial concealment from the circuit court of her identity and potential claim to her natural father's estate, and requested that the estate be reopened.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was the illegitimate daughter of a famous musician, who died intestate before her birth. The child was adopted by her paternal grandmother, but became a ward of the state upon her grandmother's death. She then was adopted and did not become aware of her father's identity until she was an adult. When his estate was still open, a guardian ad litem had been appointed to represent the child's interests in her absence, but his efforts were unsuccessful and his appeal request denied. The child filed her claim to reopen the estate over 10 years after it had closed. The court found that the estate's administrator and administratrix had for many years fraudulently concealed the child's existence and potential claims to the estate from the circuit court. The court held that, due to the fraud, the child never received the fair adversary proceeding that she was entitled to. The court also held that the circuit court's refusal to allow the guardian to appeal was legal error and sufficient, even in the absence of fraud, to affect the validity of the judgments adverse to the child. The court held that the estate had to be reopened so that the child's fair share could be assessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's summary judgment on the child's claim and ordered that two earlier judgments regarding the estate be set aside. The court remanded the cause to the circuit court for a full hearing and settlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the grantor executed a deed to the grantees, she later executed an affidavit that denied delivery of the deed and stated that it was given without consideration. The grantor died. Both the deed and the affidavit were recorder. The grantor's executor brought an action against the grantees seeking cancellation of the deed. The trial court granted the grantees' motion in limine and excluded the affidavit from evidence. Because the executor's case would fail for lack of proof without the affidavit, the court granted permission for an interlocutory appeal. The court affirmed, holding that Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 35-4-69 and 35-4-70 (1975) did not authorize admission of the affidavit. Those code sections permitted recording and use of affidavits whose purpose was to clear a cloud on title. In this case, the purpose of the affidavit was to dispute a recorded title, not to remove a cloud. The only cloud on the title was one created by the affidavit itself.</SPAN></P>

In addition, a videotape recording of the child was introduced in which the child accused defendant of fondling her. Defendant was convicted of sexual abuse and his conviction was affirmed on appeal. The court found that statute allowing the use of the child's testimony through videotape was constitutional because it gave defendant the right to be present with his attorney to cross-examine the child at the time of the deposition. The court also found that the trial court's failure to conduct a hearing before granting the motion for a videotaped deposition and the fact that defendant was not given formal notice of the deposition did not amount to a denial of procedural due process. The process that was due defendant was the opportunity to dispute the use of the videotape and the right to cross-examine the child and the trial court provided him an opportunity to do both.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinances demanded that all water customers use the trash service.

The court held that: (1) the portion of ordinance imposing fines and imprisonment for not paying the garbage service fees was inconsistent with state law, (2) water customers with certificates of exception were not subject to ordinance, (3) the water customers met the requirements of a class action because the group was numerous and had questions of law or fact common to the class, and the claims of the representative parties were typical of the class, (4) the garbage service fees were in reality an illegal form of tax used to provide general revenue for the town, and (5) the ordinance and garbage service fee schedules adopted pursuant to the ordinance were void because they violated the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee widow's husband was killed when his dump truck came into contact with uninsulated electrical wires owned by appellant electric cooperative. Appellee brought suit against appellant for wrongful death pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11(a) (1975). After appellee was awarded punitive damages, appellant sought review of the verdict and of the trial court's denial of its motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court affirmed. The court rejected the argument that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-410 (1975) violated appellant's right to substantive due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court noted that only punitive damages were available in Alabama for wrongful death. The court said that there were several safeguards in place, including appellant's right to have moved for a remittitur or a new trial or to have sought de novo appellate review, which served to guard appellant's constitutional rights. The court also found that there was sufficient evidence of appellant's negligence to have sustained the verdict and that there was insufficient evidence that the decedent put himself in danger to have found contributory negligence as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff claimed that the contractor's bid was excessive. Plaintiff initiated an action against the contractor and the hospital. The trial court granted summary judgement in favor of the contractor and the hospital. In affirming the decision, the court found that the hospital was exempt from the Competitive Bid Law. The hospital was a separate entity from the state and from any local political subdivision because it was a health care authority incorporated under Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-310 et seq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision by the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama), which affirmed the trial court's conviction of defendant for manslaughter and application of the Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Act, Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter and ordered to pay a fine and an assessment pursuant to the Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Act. The appellate court affirmed his conviction and the fine assessment. The court held that the trial court did not err in considering other factors than those listed under the Act to determine the noneconomic impact on the victim's family. The court determined that the trial court was permitted to impose a fine and an assessment under the Act and the total amount did not constitute an excessive fine pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 15-23-17(b) and Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-11. However, the court concluded that the trial judge was mistaken regarding the persons who would receive the amount that he had assessed under the Act. The court reversed the assessment because of the trial judge's mistake as to who should receive the award. The court reasoned that once the mistake was corrected, the amount of the assessment might differ from the original amount imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant escaped from prison while serving a life sentence and, after he was recaptured, was convicted of first-degree murder for killing a man during the time of his escape. He was sentenced to death under Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 319 (1940). After exhausting state post-conviction remedies for relief from his conviction for the murder, defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court. While his petition was pending, the United States Supreme Court struck down a mandatory capital statute similar to Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 319. The federal district court ruled that defendant's sentence required vacation, and then certified to the instant court the question of whether, under Alabama law, defendant could have been resentenced capitally or should simply have had his existing death sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Upon review, the court held that under the clear, absolute mandate of the Alabama Constitution, defendant could not have been resentenced to death. Because Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 319 was unconstitutional, it could not have legally been applied to impose the death penalty on defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was denied admission to the Alabama Law School in 1949, allegedly on the basis of his race. At that time, all graduates of the law school were afforded a &quot;diploma privilege&quot; and admitted to the state bar without having to pass a bar examination. That privilege was discontinued in 1965. In 1988, the attorney filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to the state bar requiring it to show cause as to why the attorney should not have been certified as a member. The court denied the petition and the attorney filed an application for a rehearing. The court denied the application. The court held that the attorney's claim was barred by the doctrine of laches and by Alabama's absolute 20-year statute of repose for actions. The court recognized that the attorney's application to the law school would have been refused because of his race and that that stated a constitutional violation. However, the court said that as a matter of public policy there came a time beyond which the attorney's claims could not have been asserted. Here, the court said, the attorney filed his petition nearly 40 years after the wrong occurred and nearly 25 years after the diploma privilege ended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ethanol retailer brought a declaratory judgment action seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Act, contending that the Act violated the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Alabama and United States Constitutions. All parties agreed to treat the hearing for the preliminary injunction as a final hearing on the merits for a permanent injunction. The testimony was heard ore tenus, and the court declared the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed but for different reasons. It found that the Act was overly broad and unreasonable in requiring labeling that would confuse and mislead the consuming public and, simultaneously, substantially diminish the ethanol retailer's business. In conducting its analysis, the court refused to apply the ore tenus standard of review in a case such as this involving a challenge to the constitutionality of legislation. The trial court's role was to determine if there was any state of facts that could reasonably be conceived that would sustain the legislative distinction between gasoline and gasohol. The trial court was not to find what it perceived to be the truth.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the amendment adding the bad faith claim after the original judgment was reversed and the case remanded was proper because the bad faith theory of liability was based upon facts previously pleaded. The court held that the reversal and remand in the previous appeal did not constitute a final judgment; hence, amendment was permissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff voter appealed a judgment of the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of defendant county commission. The court held that 1985 Ala. Acts 85-237 was constitutional and did not violate the prohibition against passing a local law in contravention of a general law contained in Ala. Const. &sect; 105 (1901).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act provided for the filling of county commission vacancies by a special election when at least 12 months remained on a commissioner's unexpired term. However, Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-6 (1975), pertaining to county commissions, stated that vacancies would be filled by appointment by the governor, and the person so appointed would hold office for the remainder of the term. The voter challenged the Act on the basis that its enactment violated the state constitutional prohibition against enacting a local law in contravention of a general law. On review, the court agreed with the voter that the Act was unconstitutional. The presence of a general law upon a given subject was primary, and a local law could not be passed by the legislature upon the subject. By constitutional definition, a general law was one that applied to the entire State and to each county in the State with the same force as though it had been a valid local law from its inception. The court disagreed with the commission's argument that, based on statutory history, it was always governed by local law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenger, who questioned the appointment of appellee adjutant general, complained of a judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) that held that the provisions of Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenger argued that the general was not appointed from among active officers of the federally recognized National Guard as required by Ala. Code &sect; 31-2-58 (1975). Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 273 (1901) stated that the Department of Defense regulations should dictate the qualifications for the adjutant general. Those regulations did not require that the state adjutant general be federally recognized to be appointed but stated that the adjutant general might be appointed without federal recognition. The requirements of Ala. Code &sect; 31-2-58 conflicted with Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 273 and the regulations on this point. The court, therefore, held that the adjutant general need not be appointed from the active officers of the federally recognized national guard because neither the Alabama Constitution nor the Department of Defense regulations required it. The court also held that when the legislature was not in session, the governor could appoint the adjutant general and he should take office subject to the subsequent confirmation by the Senate. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing the attorney fee award.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the rules, as they related to speech in a political context, were limited to misrepresentations made with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for the truth, did not restrict protected speech, and were written precisely enough that the attorney knew, or should have known, that his conduct was prohibited. The court also determined that the attorney should have known, based on Ala. R. Disciplinary Enforcement 2(a), that the rules prohibited conduct not involving the practice of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrower claimed that the lender, an insurance company, had breached its obligations under several loan agreements and had violated the relevant statutes when the loans were executed. He sought return of all finance charges and principal paid, statutory penalties, attorney fees, and damages. The trial court granted summary judgment on the statutory counts, impliedly finding that the Mini-Code, the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, and Regulation Z did not apply. The borrower argued that Ala. Code &sect; 5-19-22 did not exempt the lender from the licensing provisions of the Mini-Code. The court affirmed, finding that &sect; 5-19-22 exempted the lender from the licensing requirements. Section 5-19-22 did not qualify the exemption or limit it to those institutions acting in a particular capacity; rather, it afforded a blanket exemption for the institutions themselves. The fact that the lender also sold casualty or health insurance did not detract from the fact that it was a life insurance company and therefore subject to exemption. The plain meaning of &sect; 5-19-22 was that any company certified to sell life insurance could also make consumer loans without the necessity of additional licensing.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from the judgment in favor of the State, the court reversed. The mandate in Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals (Alabama) reversing the judgment of the trial court, which denied the petition of appellee minor for waiver of the requirement of parental consent for an abortion pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 26-21-1 et seq. (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor filed a petition for waiver of the requirement of parental consent for an abortion. The trial court denied the waiver of consent. The court of appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the cause and found that to so require the minor to petition the court for a waiver from a consent which she cannot obtain unduly burdened her constitutional right to an abortion. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in overruling the motion of the minor's attorney for a holding that the parental consent act was unconstitutional. The court of appeals incorrectly reversed the judgment on that ground. The provision for judicial inquiry into maturity and best interest, where the minor cannot otherwise obtain consent, had a reasonable relation to the state's interest in protecting minors from harmful consequences of their immaturity. The court affirmed the judgment granting the waiver of consent on the ground that the abortion was in the minor's best interest. The minor was a ward of the state, she had no family to turn to for support, her family has a history of psychological problems, and she only had a fair prognosis for delivery of the baby.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals insofar as it reversed the trial court's denial of the minor's petition for waiver of parental consent. Due to the exigencies of the case and the undue delay, the court reversed the judgment of remand. The court rendered a judgment granting a waiver of the requirement of parental consent.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-6-2(a)(2) (1975). On the first indictment defendant was found guilty of vehicular homicide, but the conviction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a victim while driving intoxicated. Defendant was charged with murder and vehicular homicide. He was found guilty of vehicular homicide but the conviction was reversed because the appellate court found that vehicular homicide was not a lesser included offense of murder and because the vehicular homicide statute was unconstitutional. Subsequently, in another case the state supreme court found that vehicular homicide could be a lesser included offense and that the statute was constitutional. Upon dismissal of the second indictment on both counts, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge because double jeopardy attached where the conviction for the lesser included offense resulted in an acquittal of the greater charge, but it reversed the vehicular homicide count. The state supreme court held that the reversal of the vehicular homicide dismissal was erroneous. Because the appellate court had held on the first appeal that defendant could not be charged with vehicular homicide, and because the jury, in finding him guilty of vehicular homicide, had acquitted him of murder, defendant could not be retried for either of the two offenses.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that, as a matter of law, the injured person was not entitled to recover against the contractor because the owner of the independent contractor's work, the state, had accepted the highway contractor's work, and, thus, the contractor could not be held liable for negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state hired defendant highway contractor to resurface and widen a portion of a state highway. The state provided the plans and specifications for the project and inspected each phase of the construction. The state accepted the work of the highway contractor. Plaintiff injured person was driving on the resurfaced highway when she hit a body of water in the middle of her lane and suffered injures. She brought an action against the highway contractor for their negligence. The trial court granted summary judgment to the contractor because it held that once the state accepted the work of the contractor, the contractor could not be held liable for negligence. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case back to the trial court. It adopted a new rule of liability for contractors to injured third-parties. The court held that contractors were liable in negligence, even if the owner of the work accepted the contractor's work. However, the court ruled that if the contractor carried out the contract specifications provided to it, it was not liable in tort to third-parties, unless the specification were so obviously dangerous that no competent contractor would follow them.</SPAN></P>

Appellants asserted that the population classification of Act No. 406, which made it a bracket bill, lacked a reasonable relationship with the statute's purpose. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. Act No. 406 was approved in 1967, and as a general law of local application, was validated by Ala. Const. amend. 389, though it was not advertised under section 106 of the constitution of 1901. The court held that it was clear from the terms of Act. No. 406 that its purpose was to provide more populous counties with a source of revenue by authorizing them to impose a privilege of license tax. The record established that the demands for services made upon county governments kept pace with urbanization and increases in population. Necessitating new opportunities for revenue. Populous counties experienced greater demands for costly services that those sparsely populated. Therefore, the requisite relationship was established.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the general appropriation act was clearly not just for educational purposes and that any appropriations made as a result of the Act from the trust fund would have to be solely for educational purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court took the questions certified by the federal district court and reaffirmed the rule of law contained in its previous decisions. The court stated that in Alabama, punitive damages were not apportionable between joint tort-feasors regardless of the degree of culpability of each individual tort-feasor. The court indicated that any change in this rule had to come from the legislature. Application of that principle resulted in a determination that the manufacturer was only liable for damages in the event that the total amount of damages exceeded the amount that the administrator had already received due to settlements with other defendants. The court however, noted that the manufacturer could place into evidence before a jury any information pertaining to the total amount of the settlements and have the trial court instruct the jury to deduct those amounts from the full amount of the damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action against defendants, seeking a judicial determination of the constitutionality of certain state statutes that established a comprehensive statewide system of electrical service territories and assigned a territory to each of the state's retail electric suppliers. The trial court held that the statutes were unconstitutional and invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court found that the statutes did not force cities to consent to have their streets burdened; the statutes only determined who would burden the streets. Alabama case law and case law from other jurisdictions indicated that a municipality only had veto power. Accordingly, the court held that while the 1984 statute violated municipalities' rights, the 1985 statute allowed for municipalities to exercise their veto power and was, therefore, not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit certified questions to the court regarding an ambiguity in the statute, Repurchase of Inventory from Farm Equipment Retailers, codified at Ala. Code &sect; 8-21-1 (1975) et seq. The appellate court was considering plaintiff manufacturer's appeal of a district court's determination that it was obligated to repurchase defendant retailer's inventory after terminating a dealership agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer sold yard and garden equipment, farm equipment, and equipment that could be used for either purpose. When the manufacturer terminated its dealership agreement with the retailer, it was obligated to repurchase inventory purchased within the last 48 months, if the retailer was a farm equipment retailer, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 8-21-1(5) (1975). The court determined the statute's meaning from legislative intent. The court held that &sect; 8-21-1(5) was to be applied by reference to a putative farm equipment retailer's inventory purchases. The retailer was primarily engaged in the farm equipment business if his inventory purchases of farm equipment exceeded his purchases of yard and garden equipment. Such purchases were to be valued at the retailer's net cost as defined in &sect; 8-21-1(4), and were to be calculated over a time period extending back to 48 months prior to the termination notice. Inventory that was designed for both farm and yard and garden use was considered farm equipment. The retailer's inventory from all sources was to be used in making the determination. Although the question was not certified to it, the court held that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court also did not find the damage award to have been excessive. The power company's argument that the imposition of punitive damages in a wrongful death case was unconstitutional was not raised until it made its post-trial motions.

Therefore, the trial court properly determined that the provision of Ala. Const. &sect; 222 requiring an election authorizing the issuance of bonds was not applicable to the instruments in question. The provisions of Ala. Const. &sect; 94 prohibiting the city from making a loan to an individual or private corporation did not apply because there was no evidence that the city had performed a proscribed transaction nor did the prohibitions in Ala.

Appellee responded by filing a motion to dismiss and successfully persuaded the trial court to deem the Act unconstitutional. Accordingly, appellant's claim was dismissed. On appeal, the Supreme Court held that the trial court was correct in holding the Act unconstitutional because specific provisions artificially placed one in violation of the Act by raising his or her own cost of business. However, it reversed and remanded the dismissal on the grounds that the Act had a severability provision, which allowed the unconstitutional provisions to be rejected while the Act as a whole, remained as law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the question, stating that a sheriff was not a county employee for purposes of imposing liability on the county under a theory of respondeat superior. A sheriff was an executive officer of the State of Alabama, who was immune from suit under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 in the execution of his office, except for actions brought to: (1) compel him to perform his duties, (2) compel him to perform ministerial acts, (3) enjoin him from enforcing unconstitutional laws, (4) enjoin him from acting in bad faith, fraudulently, beyond his authority, or under mistaken interpretation of law, or (5) seek construction of a statute under the Declaratory Judgment Act if he was a necessary party for the statute's construction. Also, that portion of Ala. Code &sect; 14-1-6, which purported to make a sheriff civilly liable for the acts of his jailer, was unconstitutional under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14.

Consolidated appeals by the city and by cross-appellants, residents and property owners, followed. Cross-appellants had filed a declaratory judgment action regarding the constitutionality of Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 11-42-40 to -88 (1975), the city called for an annexation election to annex certain unincorporated territory in the county. The trial court declared the election void and held that the city had abused its discretion when it sought to combine two dissimilar areas in the annexation election territory by using a corridor. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court on the appeal by the city, insofar as it declared the election null and void, but affirmed the judgment as to a statutory severability issue, which was the subject of the cross-appeal. The trial court correctly ruled that an unconstitutional annexation provision, Ala. Code &sect; 11-42-73 (1975), was severable from other annexation provisions, which were valid. The court rejected the trial court's finding that by changing the annexation area to exclude some residential property, the city violated the voting rights of the residents excluded. The trial court was not authorized to determine whether the annexation was a good or bad decision, only that it was fairly debatable. Under the tax exempt annexation method used by the city, the city could properly combine two or more dissimilar areas.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-9(a)(1) (1975), in sentencing him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State proved a prior drug offense against defendant, and he was sentenced as a habitual offender. Defendant contended that the Habitual Felony Offender Statute was inapplicable to enhance his conviction and that he should have been sentenced according to Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-70 (1975). At defendant's sentencing hearing, the State presented sufficient documentary evidence to establish that defendant had a prior conviction in Florida for the sale of a hallucinogenic drug. The court reversed the sentence. Section 20-2-70 did not apply because it referred to subsequent offenses relating to possession rather than to the sale of marihuana. However, the Habitual Felony Offender Act was not the proper penalty enhancement provision because the offense of which defendant was convicted was found in the Alabama Uniform Controlled Substances Act, &sect; 20-2-1 et seq. Defendant was convicted of a felony drug offense, and the prior offense was also a felony drug offense. The sentences applicable to drug offenses and repeat drug offenses were provided within the Controlled Substances Act. Because he was convicted under the Controlled Substances Act, he had to be sentenced according to its provisions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a writ of certiorari contending that the judgment was subject to reversal. Defendant specifically argued that the trial court denied his motion for mistrial or for new trial on the assertion that the prosecutors' use of their peremptory strikes to remove members of his racial group from serving on the petit jury violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court noted that cases decided by the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Alabama just after the decision rendered in defendant's case required that the matter be remanded to the court of appeals with directions to remand the matter to the trial court for further consideration. The court specified that the following principles controlled the reconsideration: the burden shifting analysis regarding the allegedly discriminatory use of peremptory strikes, with an emphasis on the prosecutions' race neutral reasoning, and the trial court's decision was only subject to reversal upon a showing of clear error.</SPAN></P>

The Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama) made findings of fact and entered a judgment granting most of the relief sought by the lessees. The tax corporation appealed and lessee's cross-appealed in order to get certain details of the order changed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the tax corporation raised the following issues: (1) whether the trial court violated members' rights by establishing substantive criteria for membership; (2) whether the trial court erroneously injected itself into the tax corporation's management; (3) whether the trial court ignored the rule that a stockholder must first comply with the corporation's internal procedure for grievance resolution before filing suit;(4) whether the trial court erroneously intruded into the business judgment of management; (5) whether the trial court erroneously awarded plaintiffs compensatory and punitive damages; and (6) whether the trial court erroneously awarded plaintiffs attorney fees. The court found that the tax corporation was not exactly like any other entity known to our law. The court held that the tax corporation was more in the nature of a commercial corporation than in the nature of a trustee of a charitable trust.Since the tax corporation was more like a commercial corporation than a trustee, the trial court erred in using its equitable powers to make changes in the internal management and to enjoin any attempt by management to dissolve the corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The professor taught in the university's business school.

The university filed a motion to dismiss and the university officials filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted both motions. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) because the university was constitutionally immune from suit, its motion to dismiss was properly granted; (2) the university officials were not immune from a suit seeking to compel them to perform their legal duties if they acted toward the professor in violation of the rules and regulations set by the university but an action for compensatory damages was barred; and (3) the professor failed to establish that it was contrary to university policy to count summer sessions as proportionately-reduced schedules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.B. 713 imposed certain environmental protection fees upon motor fuels to be used to provide environmental protections for polluted groundwater and its primary purpose was to provide for a disposition of the fees collected for returning polluted groundwater to a quality comparable to its previous state. H.B. 713 would violate Ala. Const. amend. 93, as amended by Ala. Const. amend. 354, because it imposed a fee on motor fuels to protect Alabama's groundwater. Amendment 354 did not permit the imposition of a fee on motor fuels except for in very limited circumstances set forth in the amendment itself, and protection of groundwater was not one of those circumstances, even if the groundwater was harmed by the leakage of motor fuels from underground tanks. H. B. 713 did not violate Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 70 because it was not a &quot;revenue bill&quot; which should not be passed during the last five days of the legislative session. The purpose of the Act was not simply to raise revenue but to provide certain environmental protections regarding polluted groundwater.

The court reversed the summary judgment granted to defendants. The court rejected defendants' argument that the plan unconstitutionally provided additional compensation to the employees after services had been rendered. Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 68 prohibited additional payment for services already rendered, but it did not prohibit additional compensation in exchange for additional consideration given by the employees. The employees were legally entitled to the use of their sick leave days. Their forbearance in reliance on defendants' promise constituted adequate consideration to support a contract for additional compensation. However, the retroactivity provision violated the constitution; the employees were entitled to the additional pay prospectively from the day the plan was passed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama), which affirmed his conviction for capital murder and his sentence to death pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-31(a)(2) (1975). The court granted certiorari to review defendant's claim that his constitutional rights were violated because the State used its peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors of his race from the venire solely on account of race.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court elected to review not only the judgment of the court of appeals but also the new issue, concerning the State's peremptory challenges that the lower courts did not have an opportunity to address. Where the issue was raised for the first time on appeal, defendant requested that the court review the record under the plain error rule in Ala. R. App. P. 39(k) and remand for further proceedings. The court stated that the record did not show that the State exercised any of its peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors of his race from the venire. The court held that defendant could not successfully argue that error was plain in the record when there was no indication in the record that the act upon which error was predicated ever occurred. The court noted that, where it had remanded for determinations under the guidelines set out in Batson, the records were sufficient to show that prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination could be made. Thus, while Batson applied retroactively to defendant's case, defendant was not entitled to a remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adjoining municipalities and the citizens instituted an action against the municipality to challenge its annexation, election, the drawing of the boundaries of the annexed territory, and the granting of a tax exemption to the residents. The municipality used several means of annexation, which included petition, election, and the unconstitutional method prescribed under Ala. Code &sect; 11-42-73. The trial court declared the annexation unconstitutional and voided the election. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and ruled in favor of the municipality, holding that the annexation was valid. Because the unconstitutional voting limitation was not central to the statutory scheme, the court held that it was severable and the remainder of the statute could be implemented with the voting limitation excised. The drawing of the boundaries of the annexation territory did not violate the constitutional rights of those who were left outside the territory because they wanted to be outside of it. Further, the court found that there was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause and that the annexation did not violate the rule of reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city claimed that venue was proper in the county where it was located, not in the county claiming that its lands had been improperly annexed. The trial court denied the city's motion to change venue. The court granted the writ of mandamus, holding that Ala. Code &sect; 6-3-7, which provided for venue of an action against a corporation in any county in which it did business by an agent, did not apply to municipal corporations. The court further held that an action against a municipal corporation was a local action for which venue generally laid in the county which was the situs of the municipal corporation. The court further held that Ala. Code &sect; 6-3-2 and Ala. R. Civ. P. 82(b) did not make venue outside of the situs of the city proper. The subject matter of the action was not real estate or trespass thereto, and because the act of adopting the challenged ordinances took place in the county where the city was located, Ala. Code &sect; 6-3-2 and Ala. Civ. P. 82(b) provided no ground on which to base venue in the county where the action was filed.

Appellant citizens in both cases challenged the constitutionality of appellee county's acts creating the Shelby County Planning Commission. The two challenged acts, enacted in 1982, reenacted a 1965 act declared unconstitutional by the court in 1982 because the act as passed contained material differences from the act as previously published.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sections 1 through 15 of the 1982 acts reenacted the 1965 act and &sect; 16 ratified all actions taken under the 1965 act. The citizens argued that the legislature could not enact a curative act that had the effect of impairing vested rights or of validating an unconstitutional statute. The court rejected this challenge on standing grounds because it found that none of the citizens had a vested right that had been taken away by &sect; 16. The court also rejected the argument that the legislature could not ratify actions taken under the 1965 act because the act was void. The court found that the 1982 Commission only adopted a zoning map that was already in existence, which was not, therefore, &quot;void&quot; in fact even if it was void in legal effect. Finally, the court rejected the citizens' contention that the state constitution prohibited the delegation the power to make zoning ordinances to the Commission because the Commission was a non-elected body. The found that the power was properly delegated because the acts contained appropriate safeguards against arbitrary action in their provisions for publication of notice, hearings on proposed changes, procedures, and appeals to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, who was an employee of the power company, was electrocuted on the job. On appeal the court found that a common law marriage would support a loss of consortium claim, and the common law wife of the decedent could maintain a consortium action. The court also found that the wife's right of consortium was her separate right, and a loss of consortium claim survived the death of the decedent. The court found that the immunity provision of the Alabama Workmen's Compensation Act precluded the estate administrators from maintaining a wrongful death action against the co-employees. The court held that absent the application of the wrongful death statute, the estate administrators could maintain a personal injury action because with the dismissal of the wrongful death action there would not be a double recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the sole issue presented for review was whether plaintiffs' action was time barred. The court held that Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-482 (1975) shortened the period of time to bring a medical malpractice action, but allowed a minimum period of at least one year after &sect; 6-5-482 became law to file such an action. The cause of action was brought nine years after the statute was enacted. Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court reasoned that Ala. Const. &sect; 13 prohibited the legislature from making unreasonable, arbitrary, and oppressive modifications of fundamental rights. The court held that legislation which abolished or altered a common law cause of action, was automatically suspect under Ala. Const. &sect; 13, but it was not automatically invalid. The court held that because Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-482 involved no deprivation of a minor's common law cause of action, the standard of review must have been to determine if the act was arbitrary and capricious. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, holding that the statute was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first city adopted an ordinance calling for a referendum election whereby voters of a certain district could vote on whether to annex that district into the first city.

The court held that the first city's ordinance was invalid. The court rejected the first city's contention that Ala. Const. &sect; 106 (1901), addressing special legislation, did not apply to the statute, Act 113, under which the first city's ordinance was issued. Act 113 was a local law and therefore was governed by &sect; 106. The court held that Act 113 was not passed in compliance with &sect; 106 because it was not advertised prior to the legislative session in which it was passed. Advertisement of the statute in a prior year, when passage of the Act was defeated, did not meet compliance with the notice provisions of &sect; 106. The court rejected the first city's contention that Ala. Stat. &sect; 17-15-6 barred injunctions against elections. It was better that injunctions be issued than a wasteful election conducted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed a summary judgment for defendant hospital from the Madison Circuit Court (Alabama). After the mother's infant died, the trial court held that her wrongful death claim in contract was not valid, that Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-137(2) (1975) provided the hospital with immunity from her tort claims, and that &sect; 22-21-137(2) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's 15-day-old baby was refused treatment several times at the hospital because the mother had neither medical insurance nor the $ 54 emergency room fee. The baby died the next afternoon from spinal meningitis. The mother alleged that her baby's death was caused by the hospital's negligent or wanton conduct. The mother also claimed that the hospital breached an implied contract by failing to treat her baby with the degree of skill and care required, and breached an express contract with the United States government under the Hill-Burton Act. The trial judge dismissed the claims. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the contract claim, but reversed the dismissal of the tort claim. The court held that Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-137(2), which granted the hospital immunity from tort actions, was unconstitutional. Of the several statutes authorizing the establishment and operation of public hospitals (Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11), only Article 5 prescribed immunity from tort actions. In light of the four other public hospital statutes that permitted tort actions, the Article 5 immunity was not justified by a permissible legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, and the accident victims appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the state and the department, as an agency of the state, were immune from tort liability under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The court ruled that &sect; 14 also prohibited actions against the state's officers and agents in their official capacity when a result favorable to the accident victims would directly affect a contract or property right of the state.

In this case, defendant challenged the violation of his double jeopardy rights and asserted that the rape prosecution was time barred. The court affirmed the murder and rape convictions but reversed the grand larceny conviction. Reversal for insufficient evidence had to be distinguished from reversal for procedural error. The Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy precluded a retrial on the lesser-included offense of grand larceny once the reviewing court in the preceding trial reversed the conviction on the greater offense of common law robbery because of insufficient evidence. The Fifth Amendment did not bar the murder prosecution because the evidence supported the murder count in the preceding trial. The abrogation of the death penalty for rape did not remove it from the classification of a capital offense for purposes of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature enacted the Recall Act, 1984 Ala. Acts 84-51, which provided a mechanism whereby the citizens of one city within the state could recall their city councilmen. The citizen initiated a petition to recall the city councilman, and the city councilman brought this action seeking a declaration that the Recall Act was unconstitutional. The citizen contested the summary judgment for the city councilman, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court noted that Ala. Const. amend. 41 required that laws providing for the manner of holding elections and of ascertaining the result of the same be uniform. The court agreed that the Recall Act provided a mechanism whereby an election to recall a city councilman in one city could be held. Because the Recall Act was only applicable to one city, the court concluded that it was unconstitutional under Ala. Const. amend. 41. Although there was a severability clause, the court found that no part of the Recall Act could be saved because every part of it contributed in some way to the implementation of a recall process so that the Recall Act was void in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied both of defendant's motions. The appellate court denied defendant's petition for a writ of mandamus. The court reversed and remanded with instructions for the trial court to conduct a hearing to consider the plea bargain. The trial court should have considered the terms of the plea bargain at defendant's request, notwithstanding the language in Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-81(b).

The vehicular homicide statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-192(b) (amended 1983), did not violate the guarantees of Ala. Const. art.

S. 556 provided that any municipality whose corporate limits or boundaries included lands lying outside of that county had to obtain the consent of the Limestone County Commission before annexation of lands lying in Limestone County. To each of the questions raised, the court answered no. Publication in only Limestone County would not have satisfied the requirements of Ala. Const. of 1901, &sect; 106. While &sect; 106 did not require notice of a proposed law to those indirectly affected thereby, &sect; 106 mandated the giving of notice of a proposed local law to those who would have been immediately affected by its enactment. Residents of both the annexed and the annexing territories would have a direct interest in S. 556. Regarding questions two and three, the court could not see how S. 556 would have in any way affected the current boundaries of any county; therefore, it would not have violated Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed a judgment from the Baldwin Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered a judgment in favor of plaintiff county commissioners and declared that 1984 Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners were elected pursuant to Act No. 84-639, which did away with the staggered-term method of elections that had previously been in existence in the county. The commissioners then filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to have the constitutionality of the Act determined. The trial court ruled that the Act was violative of Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 105 and that the commissioners' terms of office were thus four years. The court overturned the trial court's judgment on appeal. The court held that Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 105 stated that no local law could be enacted in any case which was provided by a general law. Pursuant to this provision, the constitutional framers prohibited the enactment of a local act when the subject was already subsumed by the general statute. The court concluded that by amending Ala. Code &sect; 11-3-1 to add the language &quot;unless provided by local law,&quot; the legislature clearly indicated that the presence of &sect; 11-3-1 was not necessarily primary, and that local laws could be passed upon that subject.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers disputed a summary judgment by the DeKalb Circuit Court (Alabama) in favor of appellee city in the officers' action to recover hazardous duty pay allegedly owed them under 1981 Ala. Acts 81-915. The main issue was whether 81-915 violated the prohibition against local laws in Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 105, because the same subject matter had been legislatively covered in Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 11-43-7, 11-43-8, and 11-43-186 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Art. IV, &sect; 105, prohibited the enactment of a local law where the subject matter of the local law was provided for in a general law. On appeal, the court reviewed the language of the two laws. Determining that the trial court had entered a well-reasoned order supporting its conclusion that the hazardous duty pay provided for in 81-915 was subsumed in the compensation to be set by the city under &sect;&sect; 11-43-7, 11-43-8, and 11-43-186, the court quoted extensively from the trial court's reasoning. The trial court applied the proper standard in reviewing the constitutionality of local laws. It properly rejected an argument that hazardous duty pay was not a subject or matter provided for by a general law. The services provided by a police officer necessarily included hazardous duty. The trial court correctly concluded that, because the setting of salaries and compensation of police officers was delegated to municipal governing bodies by the general law, the State had no authority to pass a local act, i.e., &sect; 81-915, on that subject. Because police officers were city employees, not officers, &sect; 11-43-8 did not apply. Section 11-43-7 did not allow a range of operation for &sect; 81-915.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to act no. 84-408, the city scheduled a referendum. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the city from holding the referendum and asked the trial court to declare act no. 84-408 unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that summary judgment was properly granted in favor of defendants. The court found that the bill was properly passed; therefore, the court had no authority to consider the extrinsic evidence attacking the regularity of the bill's enactment. There was no indication in the state senate journal that the governor attempt to veto and return the bill before the session adjourned. Because act no. 84-408 was based on the size of a city and provided no means for determining a city's size, the court held that a city's population was to be determined by the last preceding federal census. The court found that act no. 84-408 was framed as to be reasonably susceptible of interpretation as a general law; therefore, the court was not bound to construe it as a local law.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that several issues of confiscation were raised by the company, which had merit, and required due process consideration upon rehearing.

More than two months later, the trial court granted defendant's motion to reconsider and granted him a remittitur of plaintiff's verdict. Plaintiff alleged that the trial court had no authority to grant the remittitur, so he filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. The court granted the petition and ordered the trial court to vacate its grant of remittitur. The court held that because the trial court lacked the authority to grant the remittitur more than 30 days after the entry of the original judgment, mandamus was the proper remedy. The court further held that defendant's motion to reconsider could not be construed as an Ala. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) motion because he presented no new evidence to support his motion, and there were no extraordinary circumstances entitling him to relief from the original judgment. Finally, the court admonished the trial court that the proper remedy to challenge the denial of a motion for a new trial was for the aggrieved party to appeal as opposed to requesting relief in the form of a motion to reconsider.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought a writ of certiorari to the appellate court that affirmed his conviction conditionally and remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at his trial. Both defendant and the state sought further review. Defendant's primary claim was that he was improperly sentenced under the Habitual Offender Act.

The court held that the appellate court had the authority to remand the case, if it determined that justice would have required it, to the trial court for a determination to be made on defendant's claim that he was inadequately represented at his trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to 1945, the city had a separate school system. However, in 1945, the former city school board consolidated with the county school board. The city's schools remained under the supervision of the county school board until 1985. Then, the city council and the mayor established a separate school system for the city and appointed five persons to serve as city school board members. In plaintiffs' action for an injunction, the trial court found in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendants used the proper means under Ala. Code &sect; 16-11-2 to form a city school system. Also, because the city had more than 5,000 inhabitants, it was qualified under Ala. Code &sect; 16-11-1 to have its own school system. Further, the previous consolidation was irrelevant under Ala. Code &sect; 16-11-2. The existence of two school systems might create a duplication of services causing both systems to suffer an economic hardship for a while.

A real estate developer was engaged in the planning for construction of a golf course and a rather substantial residential subdivision located east of the city limits. As the development site lacked both water supply and sewage disposal facilities, the developer discussed the matter of providing those services with both parties. Ultimately the developer extended a formal request to plaintiff to extend its existing water and sanitary sewer lines to the site. Defendant also proposed to provide water and sewer disposal services to the development and would not give its consent to plaintiff to so in its stead. Plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action to have the trial court determine the applicability of Ala. Code &sect; 11-50-1.1. The trial court entered a summary judgment for plaintiff.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that &sect; 20-2-80 was void because it failed to provide a maximum limit of punishment upon conviction. He argued that Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, along with the state and federal due process requirements, mandated that the legislature establish a maximum limit of punishment prior to the date of the commission of the offense. The court ruled that due process was not violated by the failure of the sentencing statute to specify the maximum term of imprisonment because the statute could reasonably be construed to validly authorize a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. A life sentence had previously been held not to constitute cruel or unusual punishment for drug trafficking offenses. Additionally, the judicial determination of a maximum sentence did not offend the principle of separation of powers because no unlawful delegation of legislative power was involved. Where the legislature left to the judiciary discretion to fix a penalty, the judiciary acted in accord with its constitutional and statutory authority in imposing sentence within that discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review after the Court of Criminal Appeals (Alabama) affirmed defendant's conviction for escape by construing the word &quot;custody&quot; in the escape statute to include escapes from work release. Defendant contended that prospective application of the judicial construction of a criminal statute violated Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 22 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, which prohibited ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stationed at a work release center. Defendant failed to return to the work release center from his place of employment. He was not authorized to go anywhere except his place of employment and had instructions to return to the work release center after work. The trial court convicted him of escape. The appellate court affirmed by construing the word &quot;custody&quot; in the escape statute to encompass defendant's work release situation. Two prior decisions issued by the appellate court had supported the argument that an inmate's failure to return from his place of employment to his place of confinement did not constitute escape from custody. The court reversed. The decision subjected defendant to punishment for conduct that was free from criminality when committed. Retroactive application of the new interpretation of the statute violated his rights under the provisions of the state and federal constitutions that prohibited passage of ex post facto laws. An unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operated precisely like an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the appellate court judgment that affirmed defendant's conviction for escape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Constitution of the State of Alabama (1901) authorized its counties to collect a county-wide school tax. When the state superintendent of education approved the issuance by the county board of capital improvement warrants payable from the school tax, it failed to include one of the city boards in its apportionment calculations because it was not yet in existence. A dispute arose whether the warrants should be paid solely from the county board's apportioned share of school tax revenues, or from the net proceeds before apportionment. The trial court ordered that the warrants were payable solely from the county board's apportioned share of the tax revenues. In affirming the trial court, the court held that the legislature, in passing Ala. Code &sect; 16-13-91 (1975), intended that the tax revenues be apportioned and the warrants be retired from the apportioned share of the tax revenues but that, in the event of insolvency or default, the warrant holders would have preferred claims against the entire net proceeds to the tax revenues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee placed a weekly insert in two newspapers mailed to or sold in the county, which carried news of interest to county residents. The trial court ruled that the insert was qualified under Ala. Code &sect; 6-8-60 (1975) to publish legal notices in the county. On appeal, the court rejected appellee's argument that &sect; 6-8-60 was to be broadly construed and that the statutory mandates were satisfied if its general purpose, to give legal notice, was achieved. The court ruled that strict compliance with the plain language of the statute was more appropriate, that the insert was not a &quot;newspaper&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 6-8-60 because it was an &quot;integral part&quot; of a newspaper rather than a newspaper in and of itself, that appellee's principal editorial office was not located in the county, and that the insert was therefore not qualified to publish legal notices in the county. The court also ruled that &sect; 6-8-60 did not deny appellee equal protection, noting that the statutory classification was rationally related to the promotion of a valid legislative purpose, dissemination of public official notices in a bona fide newspaper having a fixed local character and nexus to the county.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the two-year prescriptive period in Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-410 (1940) was a statute of creation, rather than a statute of limitation because it created the original cause of action for wrongful death. The court stressed that another statute that gave the right of action for wrongful death of a minor directly to the parent did not create a cause of action for wrongful death. Section 6-5-410 governed all suits for wrongful death, whether the death was that of a minor or an adult and whether the plaintiff was an adult, a minor, or a representative. Thus, the two-year prescriptive period of &sect; 6-5-410 could not be tolled by the mother's minority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed an on-duty police officer. Defendant challenged, inter alia, the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that, in order to be found guilty of a capital offense, defendant had to have known at the time he fired the fatal shot that his victim was a police officer. Affirming defendant's conviction and death sentence, the court held that the &quot;plain error&quot; standard was not applicable because the instruction followed the pattern jury instruction &quot;recommended&quot; by the court, and defendant failed to object to the instruction. Further, the failure to give the instruction was not a &quot;particularly egregious error&quot; and would not result in a miscarriage of justice if a reversal were denied. The court also held that the penalty of death, if constitutionally applied, did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court also found that the trial judge's override of the jury's sentence did not result from passion or prejudice and that a just sentence was imposed. The court found no constitutional infirmity in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(5) simply because it made the murder of an on-duty police officer a capital offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After granting the petition, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court upholding defendant's murder conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen initiated a complaint against petitioners alleging that the legislature did not have the authority to authorize the payment of an expense allowance to its members during a recess of the legislature's special session. The lower court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss and granted the citizen's request for a preliminary injunction that prohibited the payment of petitioners' expenses. Petitioners filed a notice of appeal and a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking review of the lower court orders. The court held that the lower court erred in enjoining the payment of expense allowances to petitioners during the recess of the special session. The ratification of Amendment 57 by the people of the state authorized each member of the legislature to have an amount of expenses in the amount set by the legislature. The court concluded that the separation of powers doctrine did not allow it to inquire into the amount the legislature had determined to be necessary to cover petitioners' expenses that were incurred in the performance of legislative duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court order and remanded with directions that the preliminary injunction be dissolved. The court dismissed the petition for writ of mandamus as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sister filed an action against defendant siblings seeking a sale of land that the parties owned as tenants in common. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) granted the siblings' motion to purchase the sister's interest under the partition statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 35-6-100 to -104 (Supp. 1984), rejected the sister's request to purchase the siblings' interests, and transferred the sister's interest to the siblings. The sister appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sister and the siblings each inherited a one-seventh interest in four parcels of land from their mother. The sister claimed that the land could not be equitably divided or partitioned and sought to sell the property for the purpose of division and distribution. After the siblings indicated their willingness to purchase the sister's interest in the land, the sister notified the court that she desired to purchase the siblings' interests in the land. The trial court granted the siblings' motion to purchase the sister's interest and transferred her interest to the siblings after they paid the purchase price into the trial court. The trial court's order was reversed. The partition statute was intended to prevent co-tenants from being divested of their ownership rights in land by a sale for division. However, the sister was denied equal participation in the statutory scheme. The partition statute discriminated against the sister by denying her the opportunity to purchase the interests of the siblings merely because she had initiated the proceeding by filing a complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting the siblings' motion to purchase the sister's interest in the land, rejecting the sister's request to purchase the siblings' interest in the land, and transferring the sister's interest in the land to the siblings was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testator was a non-resident of Alabama. His will, which was probated in Texas, gave his wife a life estate in minerals located in Alabama with a power of disposition. At the time of testator's death, there was no time limit to probate non-resident wills; however, a five-year limitation was subsequently imposed. Thereafter, the widow conveyed the minerals to the titleholders' grantors. Subsequently, the legislature removed the requirement that the will be probated within five years. The heirs, who claimed title through the testator's son, sought to quiet title to the minerals, claiming that the statute requiring probate within five years created a property right that could not be taken away. The titleholders claimed that the heirs had no right to the minerals. The trial court granted summary judgment to the titleholders and the court affirmed. It found that a statute imposing a time limit for probating a will was a statute of limitations to be affirmatively pleaded and the heirs failed to plead the statute of limitations as a defense to the titleholders' counterclaim. In addition, the court held that the wife's power of disposition was absolute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed an action against the city, which was insured by the insurance company, to recover for flood damage.

The court held that &sect; 11-93-2 was applicable because a city official's omission caused the damage, and that &sect; 11-93-2 was constitutional because the legislature was entitled to take steps to keep the city solvent. The court held that the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 11-93-2 contained an aggregate limitation on the recovery of property damage when multiple judgments were returned as the result of a single &quot;occurrence.&quot; The court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide the &quot;occurrence&quot; issue because the same issue involving the same parties was pending in other proceedings, and that pursuant to &sect; 11-93-2 all injuries resulting from one proximate cause were a single &quot;occurrence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the judgment. The record demonstrated there was a preponderance of evidence from which the jury could find that defendant intentionally killed the victim in the process of robbing her of the television set. The state proved every element of the capital offense as charged in the indictment: robbery when the victim was intentionally killed. The record did not reflect that the jury could not reach a decision as to defendant's punishment or that there was pressure on the jury to reach a unanimous verdict. The record reflected that the trial court followed the guidelines of the cited case for determining the appropriateness of a death sentence. In fact, the only errors made by the trial court were in defendant's favor.</SPAN></P>

The insurance company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company argued that the tax applied only to premiums received for new policies not for policies that were merely renewed. The municipality contended that the tax should have been based on premiums received not only from new policies issued during the preceding year, but also from existing policies that were renewed. The court reversed the judgment entered for the municipality. The court held that (1) a renewal premium which simply continued in effect an existing policy of insurance with no change in coverage was not subject to the municipal license tax, and (2) where a policy was renewed and additional property or persons were insured, then the renewal premium received from such a policy was subject to this tax. The court observed that taxing statutes were strictly construed against the taxing authority. The court found that each party's interpretation of the taxing statute at issue provided a rational construction. The court stated that in such a case, a construction of the language in favor of the insurance company led to the conclusion that the legislature did not intend policy renewals to be taxable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentence to death pursuant to &sect; 13A-5-40. On appeal, he asserted that the capital offense of murder of a police officer required knowledge of the officer's status and that a trial judge should not have been allowed to impose a sentence of death after a jury recommended life without parole. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction. Defendant, subsequently, petitioned the court for a writ of certiorari. The issue was whether the statute required that the accused know that the victim was a peace officer in order for the murder to be a capital offense. The court reversed and remanded the matter. The court held that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury in accordance with defendant's requested instructions that, if the jury found him guilty of murder, capital murder could be found only if defendant knew that the victim was a peace officer on duty. The court concluded that the legislature did not intend to create a strict liability capital offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted for the capital murder of his cousin, who was strangled to death after being raped and subjected to acts of sexual abuse. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence, and on appeal, the court affirmed. Although an isolated portion of the jury charge was technically incorrect in regard to the lesser included offense of first degree manslaughter and acquittal, this error was &quot;harmless,&quot; because 1) there was absolutely no evidentiary basis for a first degree manslaughter charge; and 2) this isolated sentence was corrected in other portions of the charge. There was no possible evidence which would have supported a charge on the lesser included offense of first degree manslaughter. Defendant's reliance solely upon the defense of alibi resulted in his failure to produce any evidence warranting a charge on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. The torturous death of the victim clearly qualified as an especially heinous homicide, and the trial court properly included this aggravating circumstance in justification of the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that Alabama's jurisdiction to try to convict defendant for the capital of offense of robbery in which the victim was intentionally killed was not dependent on the venue of the robbery. The court also found that (1) defendant was not prejudiced by the existence of the preclusion clause of the 1975 Death Penalty Act (Act); (2) defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense; (3) the exclusion of a prospective juror was proper because that juror would not have voted for the death penalty under any circumstances; (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the prosecutor to remark during his opening statement that defendant had escaped from a prison camp before meeting the victim; and (5) the sentencing procedure under the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the prior litigation involving another county did not bar the present action under the principle of collateral estoppel because the issues and acts were not identical; and the prior litigation did not state the grounds for its decision. The court found that the Act expressly provided for the levy of a tax, which was in addition to the state privilege tax. The court also found that the Act was not in conflict with the general law because it did not repeal or change the general law as applied to the county.

After the trial court refused to reconsider her motion for attorney's fees, the owner sought further review. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court determined that the mere fact that the owner's suit was decided upon state grounds did not render &sect; 1988 inapplicable. It noted that her federal and state claims shared a common factual nucleus and found that the owner was the &quot;prevailing&quot; party in her suit as required by &sect; 1988. The court rejected the trial court's finding of &quot;special circumstances&quot; and noted that the Fifth Circuit had specifically rejected them all. The court held that the fact that appellees were public officials carrying out their duty did not make them immune from a &sect; 1988 award, which was an award of costs and not damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners owned undeveloped property, and in anticipation of its commercial development, they filed requests to change its zoning from residential to commercial to permit the construction of an office building. Over the landowners' objection, other landowners were permitted to intervene. The landowners' requests were denied, and the landowners appealed to the zoning commission, which affirmed the denial. The landowners appealed to the trial court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, and the trial court denied relief. The landowners appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that from the evidence presented, it was at least fairly debatable that the property had a reasonable, practical, and realistic use under the residential zoning classification, so the fairly debatable test was met. The intent to preserve the undeveloped land as a single-family residential area bore a substantial relationship to the police power of the city to promote the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, so the zoning commission's action met the &quot;substantial relationship&quot; rule. Accordingly, the zoning regulation was not unconstitutional as applied to the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers previously submitted a plat map to the city for approval. The city, before approving the plat, required the developers to designate approximately four subdivision lots as a future thoroughfare. The developers subsequently filed a complaint against the city, alleging an unlawful taking of property without compensation. It was specifically alleged that the city failed to provide compensation to the developers for the reservation of the land designated as a future thoroughfare. The city contended that the land in dispute was irrevocably dedicated to the public when the plat was recorded. The circuit court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed, holding that the legal action taken by the developers concerning the land in question was commenced long after the 10-year statute of limitation had run. The court further stated that there was nothing on the face of the plat from which the circuit court could have concluded that the developers intended to condition the dedication of the right of way. Consequently, the recorded plat was its own evidence of the dedication by the developers of the right of way encompassed by the proposed thoroughfare.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the bank. The customer sought review, contending that the dead man's statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code 1975, &sect; 12-21-163, was unconstitutional because it deprived him of equal protection and due process of law. Applying the rational basis test, the court affirmed and found that the dead man's statute furthered a proper governmental purpose and the provisions of the statute were rationally related to that purpose. Consequently, the court held that the dead man's statute was constitutional. The court also found that the customer, as the non-moving party, failed to present facts that were properly admissible in evidence. Accordingly, the court held that the bank's motion for summary judgment set forth facts which indicated that had the case proceeded to trial, no competent evidence would have been available to have supported a judgment in behalf of the customer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, State of Alabama, Secretary of the State of Alabama, sought review of the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which declared that 1983 Ala. Acts 83-683, proposing a new constitution for the state, was unconstitutional and enjoined appellants from proceeding with its adoption. Appellant Comptroller of the State of Alabama also sought review. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 83-683 provided for submission of a new constitution to the electorate for adoption in the same manner as an amendment under Ala. Const. &sect; 284 (1901 as amended). The trial court declared 1983 Ala. Acts 83-683 unconstitutional and enjoined the state from proceeding. In consolidated appeals, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court concluded that Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 284-287 provided the exclusive means for changing the state's constitution and that the state was not entitled to submit the constitution proposed by 1983 Ala. Acts 83-683 to the electorate as an amendment to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901. Also, the court concluded that existing restrictions on the procedure for adopting a new constitution could not be removed and a different procedure authorized at the same time that a new constitution was approved. The court noted that an amending article was not submitted to the people prior to the passage of &sect; 83-683, nor was an advisory opinion requested. The court held that the right of the people, acting through their delegates elected for that single purpose, to propose their own organic law, could not be altered in the manner undertaken by the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and daughter died in a car accident. Both of the estates filed wrongful death actions and were awarded damages. The husband filed the declaratory action to determine which estate should have the balance of the proceeds. Specifically, the husband sought the daughter's portion of the mother's estate and the remaining balance of his wife's estate. As representative of the daughter's estate, the husband argued that he, as the surviving spouse without any children, was entitled to all of the daughter's estate and part of the mother's estate. The court found that the daughter did not have any property rights in the mother's wrongful death action because she had died prior to the filing of the action. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment that the daughter's estate was not entitled to share in the proceeds of the mother's estate. However, the court agreed with the husband and reversed that portion of the judgment that denied the husband the balance of the daughter's estate because the controlling statute, Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The caregivers recorded the decedent's deed for 80 acres to them in exchange for one dollar and, pursuant to a later recorded agreement, a promise to provide a home for the decedent and attend to his physical needs for the rest of his life. The decedent, by his sister and next friend, filed a complaint to set aside the deed and agreement due to fraud and undue influence. A curator was appointed for the decedent by a probate court pursuant to Ala. Code. &sect; 26-7A (1975), and was substituted as plaintiff. On the curator's motion, the circuit court awarded summary judgment to the curator in declaring the deed void and reserved other issues raised in amended complaints. On a timely appeal after dismissal of the remaining claims, the court affirmed the appropriate summary judgment for the decedent, by and through his administrators, given the nature of the consideration. As 1983 Ala. Acts 83-153, in amending Ala. Code &sect; 26-7A (1975), ratified all curators previously appointed under &sect; 26-7A, the regular appointment of the decedent's curator was valid and eliminated the decedent's incapacity as an issue.

The court affirmed and held that the circuit court correctly found that &sect; 3-1-13 was unconstitutional in denying the owners the fundamental requirement of due process. The court reasoned that the state of Alabama had a legitimate interest in seeing that animals were treated humanely. Any legislation enacted by the State to further that interest, however, obviously must have complied with due process requirements. The elements of due process were lacking in &sect; 3-1-13. A humane society's officers or employees were authorized to seize an animal which, in their sole discretion, was abused or neglected. In addition to the deprivation of the owners' interest in their animals, they became liable for any expenses for their care, the amount of which expenses having been solely controlled by the society. The only &quot;notice&quot; the owners received was of the seizure and of the sale. Section 3-1-13 provided no opportunity for the owners to contest the seizure or the sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no maximum fee for a license that allowed a contractor to install and service air conditioners and heaters under &sect; 69 of the License Code. The license tax that was due each year was measured by a percentage of a contractor's gross receipts for the preceding year. The trial court held that &sect; 69 was constitutional, but that it had been applied arbitrarily and capriciously against the taxpayers because auditors without proper training and without established guidelines determined which gross receipts from outside the city to use when they computed the license fees that were due. The court affirmed because the city's request for relief was properly denied by the trial court. Although &sect; 69 discriminated among the members of a class of contractors, it was not invalid and unconstitutional on its face. Moreover, &sect; 69 was not invalid and unconstitutional insofar as it authorized a revenue tax on business that was conducted, at least in part, outside the city. However, the application of &sect; 69 with regard to the inclusion of gross receipts for business that was conducted outside of the city was arbitrary and capricious and, therefore, null and void.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the issue was whether the trial court erred in granting the university and individual's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the university from the suit. The court held that if the individuals did not act toward the professor in accordance with their own rules and regulations, the individuals acts were arbitrary, and an action for writ of mandamus would not be barred by the sovereign immunity clause of the Alabama Constitution, Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 (1901). The court held that the professor's petition was sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss because if the professor proved every allegation against the individuals, mandamus would lie.

The widow filed in the probate court a claim for her dower in real estate and distributive share of her husband' personal estate pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 43-1-15 (1975). Five years later, after the petition for sale and division of proceeds had been filed, the beneficiaries moved to dismiss the widow from the action. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 43-1-15 had been declared unconstitutional in its entirety. The court concluded that the same gender-based classification applied whether the widow dissented from a will or claimed dower in an estate governed by the will in which she was not mentioned. The court held that the opinion that invalidated &sect; 43-1-15 applied retroactively to the widow's claim because dower did not vest automatically in the widow but was allocated only on her petition and did not become a property interest until there had been an assignment. Thus, the widow had no vested interest in the property of her husband's estate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the citizen's challenge to the judge's appointment holding that the based on caselaw precedent the Anti-Nepotism Act did not apply to judicial appointments. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Despite the citizen's contention, the adoption of Ala. Const. amend. 328, &sect; 6.07 did not destroy any validity in the caselaw precedent relied on by the trial court. Moreover, because a judge was not subordinate, and could not under the Constitution have been subordinate, either to the executive or to the legislative branch, the perceived evil which the Anti-Nepotism Act sought to address did not arise in judicial appointments. The constitutional requirement of strict separation of powers between an executive department, a legislative department, and a judicial department supplied in a more fundamental and forceful way protection against any interference by the appointing authority with an appointed judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee received workmen's compensation benefits for injuries sustained in a work-related accident. Plaintiff became aware of additional injuries resulting from the same accident, but defendant workmen's compensation carrier refused to pay additional benefits for the injury. Plaintiff sued defendant employer and defendant workmen's compensation carrier in a common law cause of action. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's claim against defendant employer because the Workmen's Compensation Act, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 25-5-52 and -53, and 25-5-3 and -4, specifically precluded plaintiff from bringing claims for work-related injuries outside the Act. The Act also precluded a common law action against defendant workmen's compensation carrier because the claim was so interwoven with the benefits award under the Act that a common law action would frustrate the provisions and policy behind the Act.</SPAN></P>

The developer was denied access to a trunk line sewer running through his property, which benefited the development. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment against the developer and held that Jefferson County was not under a legal obligation to provide the developer a sewer connection at any time, under any circumstances. The legislature, in the exercise of its sovereign power, could alter the territorial limits of the municipality without the approval of the municipality's electors. The lists the registrars provided sufficiently complied with the requirements of 1980 Ala. Acts 590.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, owner of a chicken processing plant, sought review of a judgment from the Walker Circuit Court (Alabama) on its action challenging sewer, water, and gas rates imposed by appellee, a public utilities board. The trial court's order 1) found all the rates and charges reasonable; 2) vacated all previously issued injunctions; and 3) granted summary judgment on the public utilities board's unpaid charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal addressed the legal propriety of sewer, water, and gas rates imposed upon a chicken processing plant (the plant) by a municipal utilities board (the board). The plant filed an action contesting certain rates and their application. The trial court ruled in favor of the board. On review, the court held that the trial court used the proper standard when it examined whether the board acted arbitrarily, unlawfully, or unreasonably. The court also held that, while the board could consolidate rates for water, sewer, and gas services, the amount of profit generated from any one service had to be reasonable. The rate of return on the gas service was found to be unreasonable. Additionally, the court held that the surcharge on sewer services was unreasonable because there was no legislation setting the surcharge for a certain period and the cost of the service was not established. Moreover, the board failed to sample the sewer discharge in accordance with the procedures it had set. Accordingly, the court reversed the lower court's ruling in part and held that the plant was entitled to a refund of all rates for municipal utility services that were improperly imposed or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's holding. The court reversed the trial court's holding regarding the sewer surcharges and found that the actions of the board with reference to these surcharges was unreasonable. The court also held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the board on its counterclaim for charges due.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-5-218 (1975), the statute of repose. The worker was injured by an electric arc furnace and based his claims on the Alabama Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine and on negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees could prevail only if they distinguished Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-218 (1975) from the products liability statute. On review, the court asserted that the comparatively longer useful life of a building or other improvement over manufactured products militated against, rather than in favor of, appellees' conclusion. The court found that appellees failed to take into account the worker's requirement to prove that his injuries were the proximate result of appellees' negligence. The court pointed out that latent defects in a building caused by a builder may not produce injuries until the seven-year period had elapsed. The court held that appellees did not show a substantial relationship between &sect; 6-5-218 and eradication of social evil. The court found that the statute, like the products liability statute of repose, had no savings clause to provide parties injured near the expiration of the seven-year period sufficient time to seek redress for their injuries, and the failure of such a statute to make some provision for those injured shortly before expiration of the limitations period made the statute arbitrary on its face so that it could not be upheld. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded because the products liability statute at issue contained constitutional infirmities.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that allowing jurors to view television reports of the attempted assassination of President Reagan did not influence their decision. Petitioner's claim that the State used its peremptory strikes in an unconstitutional manner failed because he did not show a systematic use of peremptory challenges against blacks over a period of time. It was proper to exclude jurors who expressed an unqualified opinion that they would not sentence someone to death. The court only considered the facts as set out by the appellate court in deciding whether the sentence was cruel and unusual because petitioner failed to follow the procedures set forth in Ala. R. App. P. 39(k) regarding correcting a statement of facts. The sentence was not cruel and unusual because petitioner fired the shots that killed the officer.

The court found that rule 4.2.1, requiring the truck company not to allow its road to be used without taking reasonable precautions to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne, was so vague that men of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning. Rule 4.2.2 was unconstitutionally restrictive as it encompassed every situation in which visible fugitive dust emissions moved across a lot line without regard to damage, injury, or inconvenience.</SPAN></P>

The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) granted all defendants' motions to dismiss. The mother and daughter appealed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and daughter contended the trial court erred in granting the motions to dismiss, which were based on failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and immunity from suit under the Child Abuse Reporting Act, Ala. Code &sect; 26-14-9 (1975). The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court held that whether or not there was a violation of federal rights the mother and daughter made no specific connection between actions which occurred and those rights allegedly violated. Therefore, it agreed that the complaint failed to state a claim as to the defendants under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court found that the city and the physician were entitled to absolute immunity, but that with regard to the police office, it could not agree with the trial court that he was absolutely immune from suit. The court reasoned there were allegations of false imprisonment, false arrest, and, apparently, defamation in the complaint, that was, allegations of tortious conduct on the part of the police officer beyond those actions protected by the immunity statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class of technical institute faculty members, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Montgomery (Alabama), which was entered in favor of defendants, a state education board and its superintendent, in their action for back pay after the board equalized only the salaries of the presidents of the technical institutes pursuant to 1977 Ala. Acts 637.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The four-rank junior college salary schedule was higher than the two-rank salary schedule for technical college employees. Pursuant to the mandate of 1977 Ala. Acts 637, the board equalized the salary schedules of presidents of technical colleges and junior colleges, added ranks to the technical salary schedule, and unsuccessfully sought funding for retroactive salary increases for technical faculty members, plaintiffs sought back pay and claimed violations of their equal protection rights in a class action. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment in favor of the board and its superintendent by holding that 1977 Ala. Acts 637 authorized salary increases for all ranks of the junior college faculty, but only authorized salary increases for the technical school faculty at the previously comparable, existing ranks. In addition, the legislature failed to appropriate funds for salary increases for additional technical college ranks. The equal protection claims failed because the board's equalization of the presidents' salaries was in response to a study showing that the presidents' salaries, but not the salaries of faculty members, were below national averages.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 6-5-482(a) (1975). Plaintiff patient's action for damages for medical malpractice was based on the physician's alleged failure to diagnose a fractured vertebra.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">X-rays of the patient's back showed a fracture that the physician had failed to diagnose during a consultation less than two years earlier. The patient filed suit two years and four months after that consultation, but less than six months after discovering his cause of action for medical malpractice. Section 6-5-482 had a saving clause that permitted suits based on incidents discovered after the limitation period if filed within six months of discovery of the cause of action. The physician argued that the saving clause did not apply to causes of action discovered within the two-year limitations period. The patient claimed that the circuit court's interpretation of the statute, to permit the patient to file within six months of the date of discovery, was constitutionally mandated. The court affirmed the denial of the physician's motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that an interpretation that upheld a statute's constitutionality should be favored. The court held that the circuit court permissibly interpreted &sect; 6-5-482 so that it would not offend due process by failing to provide for an extension of the limitations period for someone injured shortly before it expired.</SPAN></P>

He was terminated from his position after he was convicted of a crime related to his position. The former employee's conviction was later set aside on a petition for a writ of error coram nobis and, on retrial, the case against him was dismissed for lack of prosecution. The former employee notified the Board that his conviction had been dismissed and requested a hearing. The Board denied the former employee's motion for reinstatement and allowed the city to amend its charges against the former employee. The trial court denied the former employee's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel his reinstatement. The former employee appealed. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the trial court correctly denied the former employee's petition for writ of mandamus. The court found that the petition was premature because the Board had not completed its hearing pursuant to Ala. Code appx. &sect;523 (Supp. 1971). In addition, mandamus was not the appropriate remedy because the dismissal of the criminal charge did not establish, as a matter of law, that the former employee did not commit the fraudulent acts.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the taxpayer challenged the execution of certain contract service agreements between the Authority and several state municipalities, utilities, and electric boards for the purchase of electric power. The trial court ruled in favor of the authority and the taxpayer appealed. The court held that a prerequisite to the Authority's power to construct and operate massive electrical generation projects, was its power to ascertain in advance the financial practicability of a proposed project. The court concluded that the obligations under the contracts did not constitute debts of the municipalities proscribed by Ala. Const. of 1901 &sect; 225 (as amended). The court held that proper notice was not given under Ala. Code &sect; 11-81-222(d); publication being required in each organizing subdivision under that section. The court held that because the jurisdictional requirements under &sect; 11-81-222(d) were not met, the court reversed and remanded with respect to the validation and confirmation of the contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment rendered in the Etowah Circuit Court (Alabama), restoring appellee police officer to his former position together with all back pay and benefits. The city contended that the circuit court erred when it granted the officer's motion in limine barring the introduction of evidence of a criminal charge of embezzlement, of which the officer was acquitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being tried for and acquitted of embezzlement, the police officer sought reinstatement. A jury found that his resignation was procured by duress such that the officer was involuntary discharged and that he was entitled to reinstatement with all back pay and benefits. The circuit court had barred the city from going into the details of the criminal offense of which the officer was found not guilty. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court erred when it granted the officer's motion in limine because the allegations of criminal activity were not disposed of by the criminal trial. Res judicata was inapplicable to the civil and criminal proceedings because the parties were different, the rules of evidence were different, and a different standard of proof was involved. Furthermore, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because the Alabama Civil Service Board, which had jurisdiction, never heard it as required by 1951 Ala. Acts 671, &sect; 13. Because the circuit court lacked jurisdiction, its judgment was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the circuit court for remand to the Board. If the Board found in favor of the officer on the question of forced resignation, it was to consider the charges brought by the city regarding the allegations of wrongdoing. After a final decision was rendered by the Board, any of the parties so desiring could perfect an appeal to the circuit court as provided by the Civil Service Act.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted under Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-2(a)(2) (1975), which made robbery or attempts thereof when the victim was intentionally killed a capital offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After violating their parole, defendant and a companion went on a crime spree, committing approximately 30 armed robberies, 9 kidnappings, and 2 extortion schemes during a 2-month period. During one armed robbery, defendant's companion killed a shop owner. Defendant was convicted under Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-2(a)(2) (1975) and sentenced to death. On remand from the United States Supreme Court, the court affirmed the conviction and the death sentence. Defendant was precluded from asserting that he did not possess the intent to kill and could have been found guilty of a lesser included offense because he testified at trial that he was ready and willing to assist his companion in killing the shop owner. An instruction on any lesser offense was therefore not required. The trial court appropriately weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances when imposing the death sentence, focusing on the particulars of the crime and the character and record of defendant. The mere fact that a sentence of death attached to the jury's verdict of guilty did not render the procedure unconstitutional where the death-penalty statute gave the trial court discretion in imposing the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The record did not reflect an entry of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, however, it did show that the district attorney and defense counsel were under the impression that such a plea had been entered. During the trial, no reference to an insanity defense was made. At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel argued the right to prove mitigating circumstances relating to mental capacity under Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-7(2), (6). The trial court ruled that the matter had been adequately covered by the previous orders to conduct psychiatric evaluations and read the two letters regarding the examinations into the records. The trial court found no mitigating circumstances. Defendant sought review, and the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court remanded to determine whether defendant's rights of confrontation and cross-examination were violated by the trial court's consideration of the two letters. The indigent defendant did not enjoy a constitutional right to have an expert appointed. Procedural changes made in sentencing for a capital offense were not an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 11-47-23 (1975) barred the suit. The owners argued that &sect; 11-47-23 could not be used to defeat their &sect; 1983 claim, and that their cause of action actually accrued within the six month period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the land was zoned multi-family, the city's planning and zoning board told the owners that a utility easement could be used in calculating the maximum number of units that could be built on it. The owners' contract to sell the land was conditioned on the availability of a permit to build 76 multi-family units on the land, but in response to a petition by owners of a nearby apartment complex, the city's zoning board of adjustment determined that the easement should be excluded, and that only 68 units could be built. The owners' petition for a variance was denied in October of 1980, and in February of 1981, the loan for the construction project closed. In May of 1981, the owners filed their suit. On review, the court found that under &sect; 11-47-23, the city received notice when the suit was filed, but that the owners' cause of action accrued not when the construction loan closed, but when their petition for a variance was denied and not when the construction loan closed.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 3A-5-31 (a)(3) (1975). The victim was defendant's six-year old neighbor; defendant was 15 years old at the time of the offense.

He told a neighbor that the strange smell on his clothing was from the victim; he also told the neighbor where the victim would be found. On appeal, defendant raised several claims. The court rejected each claim and affirmed the conviction. The court held that the introduction of the transcribed testimony of defendant's neighbor from a juvenile hearing was properly presented at the preliminary hearing. In addition, the court held that &sect; 13A-5-31 (a)(3) had not been declared unconstitutional and that there was no merit to the claim that the criminal proceedings violated the constitutional provisions against ex post facto laws. The court further held that defendant's age did not bar his conviction for carnal knowledge or rape under &sect; 13A-5-31(a)(3). In addition, the court held that the lower court properly refused to instruct the jury on the less included offense of manslaughter because defendant denied the killing and there was no evidence that it occurred through recklessness or in the heat of passion. Although the conviction was based on circumstantial evidence, the court held that the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>
