</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bondholders sought review from the Hinds County Chancery Court, First Judicial District (Mississippi), in which they were denied recovery on bonds issued prior to the Civil War. The trial court held that the actions were barred by the running of the statute of limitations and granted defendant state's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that Miss. Const. &sect; 258, by which the state repudiated the bonds, did not prohibit the bondholders from bringing suit, but prohibited the state from making any payment on the underlying debt. The court would not allow the bondholders to use equitable principles to circumvent their lack of diligence in bringing their suit over one hundred years after the statute of limitations had run. It was not until one hundred and twenty years after the seven-year statute of limitations went into effect before the bondholders asserted their rights in claiming payment owed by the state. The financial hardship of paying the bonds that would be imposed on the state was the type of hardship that was contemplated by the court when the doctrine of laches was adopted. Regardless of whether &sect; 258 was in conflict with the United States Constitution or not, the statute of limitations began running at the time the right to collect the interest and debt duly owed on the bonds accrued. Thus, the time bar of the claim was dispositive, and it was not necessary for the chancellor to go further and hold &sect; 258 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the chancellor correctly held that the statute of limitations had run and the bondholders were barred from pursuing their claim. The determination that the repudiation of the bonds was unconstitutional was error because the running of the statute of limitations was dispositive in granting the state's motion for summary judgment in the bondholder's suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a ruling from the Hinds County Chancery Court, First Judicial District (Mississippi), which ruled that its zoning ordinance regulating adult entertainment, particularly topless dancing, was unconstitutional. Appellee adult club had challenged the ordinance when it had difficulty obtaining permits from appellant. Adult entertainment was allowed only in areas zoned light industrial, I-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought to regulate adult entertainment and enacted a zoning ordinance. Appellee adult club opened for business in an area that was not zoned for adult entertainment. A federal circuit court found the ordinance constitutional. The chancery court found it unconstitutional and that females had equal protection to be topless in the same way as males, with the ordinance being enforceable only if the reference to gender was struck. On review, the court found that the statute was not vague and ambiguous and that the chancery court's interpretation led to an absurd result. The court found appellee's challenge to the ordinance barred because it attempted to elude res judicata by raising a new legal theory. The court asserted that the chancery court went outside the scope of the pleadings in ruling that females had equal protection to be topless in the same way as males, that it lacked proper jurisdiction, and that treating males and females differently under these circumstances did not violate the equal protection clause. The court found that the difference in treatment had a substantial relation to appellant's interest in regulation, and the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the ruling of the lower court, which had ruled against appellant city and in favor of appellee adult club. A common sense reading and interpretation of the ordinance found it not vague or ambiguous. The constitutional challenge to the ordinance was precluded under res judicata. The chancellor erred by going outside the scope of the pleadings and determining that the ordinance violated the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the DeSoto County Circuit (Mississippi), which convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to die for the death of a child committed during felonious abuse and battery. He was also found guilty and sentenced to serve two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for the murders of the child's mother and grandmother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury convicted defendant of capital murder, he appealed numerous rulings of the trial court. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence of his clothing because these were items seized in plain view during a valid arrest. Evidence of prior drug use by the defendant was allowable under Miss. R. Evid. 404(b) because it was interrelated to his responses to police questioning. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in trying defendant in ankle shackles due to his violent jail behavior. The victim's photographs had evidentiary value that outweighed any prejudice. Relevance and admission of expert testimony was within the trial court's discretion. Prior transcripts were properly used to impeach defendant. A jury instruction regarding defendant's flight from police was proper because the flight was unexplained and probative of guilty knowledge, and the instruction regarding the heinous nature of the crime had appropriate limiting language. An underlying felony was properly used as an aggravating factor under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101. Prosecutorial comments, while questionable, were proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for murder and capital murder, and also affirmed his death sentence and his two consecutive life sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Pike County (Mississippi), which awarded appellee employee actual and punitive damages and damages for mental anguish in her suit against appellant for failing to provide compensation for her work-related injuries and firing her for filing a claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer denied appellee employee coverage for injuries she claimed were job-related and terminated her employment. Appellant was not covered by workers' compensation and instead was self-insured. The employee handbook provided that employees would be compensated for on-the-job injuries up to the coverage provided in the Workers' Compensation Act. However, appellee employee's claim for coverage was denied as appellant claimed the injuries were not work-related and terminated her employment. The trial court granted appellee employee judgment for actual and punitive damages and damages for mental anguish. It also entered judgment to reimburse appellee employee benefit trust for costs expended for appellee employee's health care. The court affirmed the award of actual compensatory damages because there was an agreement between appellant and appellee employee that the equivalent of workers' compensation benefits would be provided and the injuries were job-related. The jury award for mental anguish damages and the award to appellee employee benefit trust were also affirmed. The court reversed the award of punitive damages, however, because the facts did not support the award.</SPAN></P>

It also affirmed the award to appellee employee benefit trust. The award of punitive damages was reversed, as the facts did not support the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The store's security guard suspected a customer of shoplifting and an altercation arose between the customer and a security guard. The store brought charges against the customer for assault and battery. After a municipal judge dismissed the charges, she brought suit against the store for malicious prosecution. The store's motion for summary judgment was supported by an affidavit from the municipal judge in which he stated that he really believed she was guilty but dismissed the charges in order to be lenient. The circuit judge granted the store's motion for summary judgment and the customer appealed, claiming that it was improperly considered. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court judgment. The court held that the affidavit constituted relevant and admissible evidence with regard to the issue of whether the municipal court criminal proceedings terminated in the customer's favor. Having so held, it was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the circuit judge properly granted summary judgment on the issue of malice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to 30 years in custody and ordered to pay a fine. On appeal, the court affirmed her conviction. The court found that the trial court properly found the indictment correctable because the issue was one of form and not substance and allowed the State to amend the indictment to accurately reflect defendant's age.

The prisoners were charged with felony crimes that occurred prior to the bill's effective date of July 1, 1995, and their charges were not to be disposed of until after July 1, 1995. The trial court held that S.B. 2175 was an ex post facto law as applied to the prisoners. On the Commissioner's appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the proper method of review was the &quot;effect&quot; review, which provided that when an amendment did not retrospectively change an offense's sentencing range but did make a change that could indirectly affect the length of a prisoner's term, no Ex post facto Clause violation occurred because the possibility of an indirect effect was speculative. Here, however the court found that S.B. 2175 lengthened the prisoners' sentences and eliminated any possibility for parole. Thus, because the amendment directly increased the punishment for covered crimes and the effect on the prisoners was not merely speculative, Senate Bill 2175 was an ex post facto law that violated the United States and Mississippi Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school board challenged a judgment from the Jackson County Youth Court (Mississippi), which entered a permanent injunction preventing the school board from taking any further disciplinary action or punitive action against appellee student in connection with or in any manner related to the student's violation of school policy on the consumption of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board suspended the student for violating the school's policy on the consumption of alcohol. As a punishment for the suspension, the student was given no credit for classes missed during the suspension period. The school board's application of the policy meant that the student would be suspended for 10 days, receive a grade of 0 for each day he was suspended, and receive, at best, a grade of 65/F for the semester's work. The youth court found that two provisions of the school's policy violated various constitutional rights of the student. On appeal, the school board contended that the policy could not be declared facially overbroad. The court affirmed the judgment of the youth court in part and modified it in part. The court held that: (1) the school board could constitutionally proscribe consumption of alcohol within limits; (2) the youth court correctly ruled that the punishment was arbitrary and capricious as applied to the student, not on constitutional grounds, but on statutory ones; (3) the injunction should be modified to give the student no credit for his class work for the last five days of his suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the permanent injunction by allowing the school board to give the student no credit for his class work for the final five days of his suspension. As modified, the court affirmed the judgment the enjoined the school board from taking further disciplinary action against the student for his violation of the school policy against alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remand for a new trial, holding that while some of defendant's wife's challenged statements were not privileged because they were made in front of a third person, certain statements made by defendant to his wife were in confidence and their admission constituted prejudicial error in violation of Miss. R. Evid. 504. In addition, the trial court found that the indictment was not deficient for failing to provide the exact date of the crime, and that although the State could not admit proof of defendant's age through the regularly conducted activity hearsay exception, it was admissible as a non-hearsay admission. Finally, the court held that statutorily mandated penalties did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a grand jury indictment, defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated assault for his involvement in the shooting of an individual during a gang altercation. On appeal, the court affirmed. Holding certain arguments as procedurally barred, the court held that the evidence failed to show that the trial judge specifically targeted defendant in his charge to the grand jury. In addition, defendant failed to comply with the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-15-35 in order to properly support his motion to change venue. The court determined that allegedly damaging testimony was invited by defendant's questions and that the trial judge properly admonished the jury to disregard. In addition, evidence of gang affiliation was admissible to show motive and was not substantially more prejudicial than probative. The court further held that an aiding and abetting jury instruction was properly given and other instructions were properly refused because they were not appropriate lesser offense instructions. The court finally found that the trial judge considered youthful offender sentencing alternatives in determining the sentence, which was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

Later, she was again interviewed and made self-incriminating statements. Although defendant was being interrogated, the court found that defendant's Fifth Amendment right to counsel was not violated because she was not in custody where she voluntarily went to the sheriff's office and was not physically restrained from leaving. Although defendant was told that she could not leave, the court found that she was temporarily detained in order to obtain a missing-person report.

Defendant's discovery stated that his former wife would testify that the victim had stated that she would not have pressed charges if defendant had &quot;kissed her and got her ready.&quot; When she took the stand, the wife testified that the victim had stated that she would drop the charges if she were paid.

No violation of &sect; 99-17-1 occurred because the &quot;good cause&quot; covered the period between the trial settings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Pike County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of unlawful possession of cocaine with intent to deliver and sentenced him to pay a $ 30,000 fine and serve 30 years, as an habitual offender, in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections without parole, probation, good time, or early release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for the crime of unlawful possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. He was not indicted, however, until nearly two years later. Defendant was convicted and was sentenced as a habitual offender. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The trial court did not err in refusing to suppress evidence found during a warrantless search of defendant's car. The agents' informant had recorded conversations with defendant in which defendant agreed to go to New Orleans and get the informant cocaine; thus, the agents had probable cause to believe that the promised drugs was somewhere in the car. Moreover, because the car was in motion and was close to the state border when it was stopped, the exigency requirement excusing the issuance of a warrant was satisfied. There was no error in allowing evidence of defendant's prior illegal acts, as it went to his predisposition, which was relevant to his entrapment defense. It was the combination of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139 and the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 that led to defendant's sentence, and as his sentence fell within those guidelines, it was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, personal injury victim and his wife, sought review of a summary judgment from the Alcorn County Circuit Court (Mississippi) entered in favor of appellees, county, county board of supervisors (board), board members, and corporate sureties, in appellants' personal injury action. The summary judgment was entered in favor of appellees on the basis of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim sustained a broken neck and was rendered quadriplegic after he drove his truck into a washout in the middle of a county road. The washout occurred after one of the county supervisors decided to replace a rotting bridge with a culvert and, in fact, supervised the installation of the culvert. The responsible county commissioner also discovered the washout, but he did not take any preventive action other than to put up unlighted warning signs. The court reversed and remanded the action with respect to the one responsible supervisor, concluding that genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether he exceeded his authority and whether he was so grossly negligent that his action might be described as constructively intentional. In all other respects, the court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected appellants' argument that the immunity statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-6 et seq., was unconstitutional. Appellants asserted that sovereign immunity was inapplicable where the governmental authority created the hazard, but the court refused to carve out an immunity exception. The court also found no breach of ministerial duty on the part of the board or its members.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-77 was unconstitutional. A special master declared the section unconstitutional during a hearing to show cause why the director of the state hospital should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with a commitment order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued a commitment order that required the director to admit an insane person for examination and treatment. The insane person was never admitted. The director and the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi were both ordered to appear at the show cause hearing. The Attorney General did not appear, nor was he given notice that the constitutionality of the commitment statute was being challenged. The trial court held that the portion of &sect; 41-21-77 which provided that no person shall be admitted to the state hospital until the director determined that facilities and services were available was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court erroneously declared the portion of the statute unconstitutional without proper notice to the Attorney General. The court found that although the lower court had the authority to declare the statute unconstitutional, its actions were improper because the issue could have been easily resolved without reaching the constitutionality of the statute. Also, under Miss. R. Civ. P. 24(d), the Attorney General was required to be notified of the constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered a judgment that the statute remained cloaked in the presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's capital murder conviction and death sentence had previously been affirmed by the court on appeal, and writ of certiorari denied.

In his certiorari petition defendant raised the particularized findings and aggravator issues. Defendant claimed in his application under the Act that counsel was ineffective because he failed adequately to investigate and present mitigation evidence regarding defendant's mental health, intelligence level, and alcohol use; to request transfer to youth court; to raise the denial of certain jury instructions on appeal; to object to the robbery, avoiding arrest, and pecuniary gain aggravators; and to preserve reversible error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death following a resentencing hearing held on remand after the original sentence of death was reversed on appeal. On direct appeal, the court affirmed the sentence of death and rejected all of defendant's numerous grounds for appeal.

The omission of the kidnapping instruction in the resentencing phase was cured by that first jury's conviction of murder and kidnapping, which by necessary implication allowed the resentencing jury to consider whether defendant was guilty of the underlying felony of kidnapping for aggravator purposes. The resentencing jury could &quot;reuse&quot; the capital murder conviction to establish the aggravator that the offense was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant threatened to obtain revenge on his ex-wife by harming one of her daughters. After the victim's disappearance, defendant told a friend that he killed the girl prior to discovery of the victim's body. No other direct evidence linked defendant to the murder. On appeal, the court applied a four-part balancing test and rejected defendant's claim that his constitutional right to a speedy trial was denied. The court upheld the admissibility of defendant's prior murder conviction because an element of the State's case required proof that defendant was under a life sentence when he murdered the victim in this case. The court determined that the prosecutor's indirect reference to defendant's failure to testify was harmless error. Defendant was not entitled to a circumstantial evidence instruction because his confession to his friend that he killed his stepdaughter removed the case from the circumstantial context. The court reversed defendant's sentence because the jury was not informed that he could be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The trial court's instructions on three aggravating circumstances was also error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's first trial ended in a mistrial, but the second trial resulted in a conviction for manslaughter. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there was no reversible error when the circuit clerk was allowed to provide requested information to the prosecution during jury selection. The trial was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Mississippi Constitutions because defendant failed to prove the prosecutor's intent in forcing defendant to request a mistrial. The trial court did not err in refusing to declare unconstitutional the statute setting forth the compensation plan for circuit clerks because circuit clerks had no judicial power to make decisions affecting the outcome of cases. The trial court also did not err in refusing to direct a verdict or to issue a peremptory instruction of not guilty on all counts when the expert testimony and defendant's own testimony supported a finding that the shooting was not accidental. The court found that the jury was correctly and completely charged.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner claimed that his plea was involuntary, and that he did not understand the charge and the consequences of the plea.

Further, the court fount that the legitimate heir took a position in the estate of the decedent that was beneficial to herself and detrimental to the illegitimate son. The court determined that the legitimate heir was under a duty to act for the rightful heirs of the decedent, not for herself.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant unsuccessfully challenged his murder conviction and death sentence. The court rejected all of defendant's four ineffective assistance claims related to counsel's failure to request an identical offense instruction, his alleged failure to fully utilize available mitigation evidence, and his allegedly deficient guilt-phase and penalty-phase closing arguments. It also rejected, again on the merits, defendant's 10 preserved non-ineffectiveness claims, pursuant to which defendant asserted that his custodial statement should have been suppressed, that an inflammatory videotape was admitted, that his prior conviction was improperly proved via event testimony rather than a certified record, that an unduly vague aggravator was relied upon at penalty phase, that he was improperly restricted in his presentation of mitigating evidence, that the penalty-phase instructions were erroneous, that death was a disproportionate punishment, and that cumulative error existed. Defendant's remaining 11 claims were deemed waived, and lacking in merit anyway.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Grenada County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of capital murder, kidnapping, and grand larceny and sentenced him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 17 years old when he kidnapped, robbed at gunpoint, and killed a taxi driver and was convicted of kidnapping, grand larceny, and capital murder with armed robbery as the underlying offense. Defendant's alleged 16 errors regarding the guilt and sentencing phases of his capital murder and kidnapping convictions that the court found were either without merit or were procedurally barred. For example, the court held that being 17 years old at the time of the killing did not constitutionally preclude the death penalty nor was it necessary for the state to specifically instruct the jury on asportation to sustain a conviction for kidnapping. The court affirmed both his convictions on those charges and his death sentence. However, because the elements of grand larceny were included in the crime of robbery, once convicted of capital murder with armed robbery as the underlying offense, conviction on the grand larceny charge constituted double jeopardy under the particular circumstances of the case. For that reason, the court vacated defendant's sentence and conviction for the lesser included offense of grand larceny.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence as to the charges of kidnapping and capital murder because the assignments of error as to those charges were either without merit or procedurally barred. However, conviction on the grand larceny charge constituted double jeopardy, and as to that charge the court reversed and vacated the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mayor and defendant city council both sought review of an order of the Chancery Court of Leflore County (Mississippi), which provided that under the mayor-council form of government, the mayor had exclusive power to appoint the city attorney and other municipal court personnel and that the council's voting on claims before they were paid did not infringe on the mayor's executive power over the city budget.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After adopting the mayor-council form of government under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-8-1 (1972) et seq., the mayor continued appointing municipal court personnel subject to city council confirmation and city council continued to vote on unpaid claims under earlier ordinances. When a conflict arose over appointment of a new city attorney, the mayor filed an action against the city council claiming he had exclusive authority to appoint a city attorney and administer the city budget. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part, finding first that legislative and executive powers were separated under Miss. Code. Ann. &sect; 21-8-9 (1972) and Miss. Code. Ann. 21-15-25 (1972) and vested the governing authorities with the power to appoint the city attorney. Thus, the ordinance requiring city council confirmation of appointments was still valid under the mayor-council form of government. Since Miss Code Ann. &sect; 21-39-9 (1972) mandated actions on unpaid claims at each regularly scheduled meeting of the governing authorities, and the mayor did not meet with himself, the court held that the city council did not usurp executive authority over the city budget when it voted on unpaid claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the trial court's order that held that the mayor had exclusive authority to appoint the city attorney and court personnel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner used his property, which was located in an area zoned for residential use, for growing trees. When he filed a petition to have the property rezoned as agricultural, the county tax assessor held that it was properly assessed as residential. The board affirmed the assessor's order, and the landowner appealed. The trial court affirmed the board's decision and overruled the petition for change of assessment. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that the board improperly applied a reclassification test that focused on the use, assessment, and zoning of other lots located in the platted subdivision when assessing the landowner's lot. The court found that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-35-50(4) specifically required the assessment to be based on the current use of the property, regardless of the zoning in the subdivision. The court stated that the board erroneously created a discretion that did not exist and acted beyond its powers when it granted such discretion to the assessor. The court held that the erroneous assessment singled out the landowner as a class of taxpayer and was so disparate as to deny him equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

The court granted defendant's writ, reversed defendant's convictions for aggravated assault and armed robbery, and remanded to the lower court for a new trial. The court found that the district attorney, in closing arguments, improperly argued to the jury that defendant's four previous convictions for uttering forgery were substantive evidence of his guilt for the crime of armed robbery. Although defendant's prior convictions were brought up in his testimony and through his attorney during voir dire, the prosecution should only have been allowed to use the prior convictions for the limited purpose of impeaching defendant's credibility. The court also found that the trial court erred in denying defendant's request to present evidence of the police officers' bias and prejudice against him in his direct examination because evidence of bias, motive, or interest was relevant and it should not have mattered when defendant sought to introduce this evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction from the Copiah County Circuit Court (Mississippi), for capital murder and four death sentences imposed, in connection with the stabbing deaths of his four young nieces and nephews, and aggravated assaults upon his sister and another niece while he was in search of money kept in a safe in his mother's home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended, inter alia, that the presence of the sheriff, a witness for the state, in the courtroom throughout the proceedings violated Miss. R. Evid. 615, the rule of sequestration, and warranted reversal. The record indicated that the sheriff left the courtroom during the testimony of the chief deputy sheriff, who was the investigating officer, but that he was present during the testimony of a witness, whose testimony, defendant asserted, he was then called to rebut. The prosecutor merely stated that he felt that for security purposes the sheriff should be allowed to remain. The court found it appeared that the state was attempting to circumvent the sequestration rule when it made the apparently impromptu decision to designate the sheriff as its representative after defendant raised an objection to his presence in the courtroom at the beginning of voir dire. But defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the sheriff's presence or his testimony. The sheriff's &quot;rebuttal&quot; of the witness' testimony was limited, and the chief deputy sheriff corroborated the details. The court found there was no prejudice to defendant and any error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no errors warranting reversal and affirmed the conviction of capital murder and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the trustees of the county school board filed a complaint against the individuals, alleging that the certain sixteenth section leases should be declared void due to the gross inadequacy of consideration initially paid for the leases. The individuals argued that the trustees were equitably estopped from challenging the subject lease because they were on notice that the individuals were claiming under their leases, and the board suffered in silence for 33 years. The individuals further claimed that they went to great trouble and expense, in plain view of all, to permanently improve their lands. The trial court found in favor of the trustees and declared the lease void. The court affirmed the order, by holding that the board was not equitably estopped from asserting inadequacy of consideration for the lease of school trust land because the gross leasehold fee of one-half cent per square foot fell within the &quot;grossly inadequate&quot; standard so as to be an unconstitutional donation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted an interlocutory appeal to review a decision of the Circuit Court of Forrest County, Mississippi, which denied a motion to dismiss by appellant Mississippi Transportation Commission (MTC). MTC claimed that it was protected by sovereign immunity from an action filed by appellees, a motorist and his wife. Appellees claimed that MTC had actual and constructive notice of a dangerous condition and failed to correct it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously reversed the trial court's earlier order that granted MTC's motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity. The motorist was traveling on a highway and allegedly encountered standing water, which caused his vehicle to hydroplane out of control and into two pine trees. As a result of the accident, he suffered extensive head injuries leaving him permanently and totally disabled. The court determined that its earlier decision finding Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-1 et seq.&nbsp;unconstitutional was not to be applied retroactively. Thus, the court reversed and concluded that the defense of sovereign immunity was available to MTC on the date of the motorist's accident. There was nothing in the record to suggest that MTC waived this immunity. The court rejected the motorist's argument that if the court's earlier decision was prospective, then MTC was still not immune from suit because it did not have immunity for proprietary acts. This argument failed because the distinction between governmental and proprietary functions were applied only to municipalities and not to the state itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board revoked the veterinarian's license to practice on the grounds that he dispensed narcotics outside the ordinary course of his professional practice and was guilty of dishonorable and unethical conduct likely to harm the public. On appeal he raised claims of procedural and constitutional errors. The court affirmed the board's decision to revoke his license, ruling that the evidence clearly supported the board's ultimate finding that the veterinarian violated &sect; 73-39-19(o), (s). He gave drugs to one person, injected another with drugs, sold the drugs, and traded them for sex. The court ruled that the board complied with the notice requirements in &sect; 75-39-20, &sect; 25-43-13. The veterinarian's state and federal due process rights also were not violated because &sect; 73-39-19 was not vague, he had ample notice of the disciplinary hearing and the charges against him, he appeared and testified at the hearing, he had an attorney, he called witnesses, and he cross-examined the witnesses against him. The court also ruled that because the record clearly supported the board's finding, its failure to make specific rather than general findings did not impede the court's review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed that the county was responsible for maintaining the culvert area and when rains had washed out the culvert area it was the duty of the county and its officials to keep people, as the motorist, from driving into the hole. Appellant further claimed the individual supervisors had qualified immunity and that the function of maintaining the roads was a discretionary function. The court held that the county had immunity from the claims, but that the individual supervisors had qualified immunity, and that the function of deciding to replace the bridge with a culvert was discretionary, so there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the supervisor in charge of the culvert had exceeded his authority or was so grossly negligent that his action were described as constructively intentional.

Before the voir dire of jurors, the trial court sustained the doctor and heart clinic's objection to the line of questioning regarding medical negligence and insurance crisis. On appeal, the court held that while it was error to refuse to allow a party to question prospective jurors to determine whether they were biased, prejudiced, or had any interest in the outcome of the case, the executor's counsel was not free of limits during voir dire. The court held that the trial court erred in precluding the line of questioning because it might have exposed juror bias affecting their ability to render a fair and impartial verdict, but that the error was harmless because the advertisements in the case were geared toward reducing the amount of damages and at no point was it suggested that jurors should have found the doctor and heart clinic not liable. The court held that the focus of the advertisement was upon punitive damages, which were not sought by the executor and affirmed the order from the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Upon the jury's vote that the death penalty be imposed, the Harrison County Circuit Court, First Judicial District (Mississippi) sentenced the defendant to death by lethal injection, Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was indicted for capital murder, rape, and kidnapping. He received a change of venue and was tried in another county, where a jury found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to death on the capital murder count. The defendant was also convicted of the rape and kidnapping and received additional sentences by the trial judge of 30 and 35 years to run consecutively. On appeal, the court noted that most of the issues raised were either procedurally barred or without merit, however, proceeded to address certain issues raised, including whether there was sufficient evidence of felonious intent and that the sexual battery occurred in substantial temporal and factual relation to the murder to support a capital murder conviction, whether the police officers' search exceeded the scope of their warrant, and whether defendant met his burden of showing a pattern of purposeful discrimination as to trigger a Batson analysis. After considering those issues, the court found that the defendant received a fair trial, conducted a proportionality review under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-105(3)(c), and affirmed the conviction and sentence of death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction of capital murder and sentence of death was affirmed because it was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

Shortly after his release on parole from his life sentence for murder, the prisoner was arrested. Although charges were dismissed, the prisoner's parole was revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court observed that pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (1994), cases in which a prisoner claimed that his parole or conditional release had been unlawfully revoked were exempt from the Post-Conviction Relief Act's three-year statute of limitations. The court found, therefore, that the trial court erred in dismissing the prisoner's petition as time-barred. The prisoner had alleged that his parole had been revoked without probable cause, that the sole basis of the revocation was an arrest, and that the charges filed pursuant to the arrest had been dismissed for lack of evidence. Accordingly, the prisoner argued that appellee parole board's revocation of his parole had been illegal and unconstitutional. The court rejected the State's argument that in cases of parole revocation the three-year statute of limitations began at the time of the parole revocation. The court pointed out that the unambiguous language of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) exempted a challenge of revocation of parole from the Post-Conviction Relief Act's three-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of a judgment of the Forrest County Circuit Court, Mississippi, which denied his petition for post-conviction relief as time-barred. Appellant had filed his petition some eight years after having been convicted for armed robbery, arguing that his ineligibility for parole for a period of 10 years was cruel and unusual punishment and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected appellant's argument that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3(1)(d) (Supp. 1994), under which he was sentenced and which provided that no person convicted thereunder was eligible for parole until they had served 10 years, was in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Appellant argued that no other crime of violence imposed such minimum requirement and that the statute did not make a distinction between armed robbery cases where individuals were harmed and where there was no harm to the victims, as in appellant's case. The court noted that the maximum sentence allowed under the armed robbery statute was life imprisonment, which had been held not to be so disproportionate as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Logically, then, appellant's 23-year sentence could not cruel and unusual, nor could the statutory requirement that he serve 10 years of the sentence. The court held that, in any event, the petition was time-barred, noting that the wrongful-revocation-of-parole exception of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) cited by appellant could not apply because appellant had never been paroled nor conditionally released; thus, there could be no wrongful revocation of parole.</SPAN></P>

When their cases were deflected to the appellate court, they filed motions that the cases not be remanded or assigned to that court on the grounds that by establishing the appellate court, the Mississippi Legislature had unconstitutionally usurped the power of the Supreme Court of Mississippi.

Further, the Mississippi Legislature had the power to create a court of the same type and character as any other constitutionally created court. Moreover, the language of Miss.

</DIV>

In the original opinion, the court held that defendant was improperly sentenced to death using the unconstitutionally vague &quot;heinous, atrocious and cruel&quot; aggravator, without a limiting instruction. The court also held that, consistent with its prior decisions, it lacked the state statutory and constitutional authority to reweigh a flawed jury verdict. The court then remanded the case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing. The state petitioned for a rehearing and the court held that the changes in Miss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The youth court judge and the board of supervisors had each hired an administrator for the essentially the same administrative position in the youth court. The court first refused to examine the issue of whether Mississippi's Youth Court Act was unconstitutional because the issue had not been raised at trial. The issue of whether the youth court judge had the authority to hire a new youth court administrator could be determined without considering the constitutionality of the Youth Court Act. The court ruled that appellants' claims had no merit and affirmed the dismissal of the writ. Statutory authority for the appointment of a youth court administrator was clearly granted only to the youth court judge. The court examined the relevant provisions of the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43-21-101, et seq., (Supp. 1979), and held that the youth court judge complied with all appropriate statutes in his appointment of a replacement youth court administrator. The court found that appellants' argument concerning whether the board had statutory authority to hire a youth court facilities administrator was totally devoid of merit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the circuit clerk illegally assisted the prosecutor in selecting the jurors. The court held that there was no impropriety in the jury selection. The prosecutor conducted jury voir dire and made decisions relative to changes. The circuit clerk simply provided background information about jurors at the prosecutor's request. The same information was available to defendant. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict because the record supported a finding that the shooting was not accidental and was at least manslaughter. Eye witness testimony and forensic evidence conflicted with defendant's version of the circumstances of the shooting. The court held that the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's proffered jury instruction on murder and that an accident defense was inapplicable. Because the shooting occurred as a result of the unlawful act of suicide, the death was not an accident. The court held that defendant failed to substantiate his allegation that the trial judge should have recused himself.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion as to petitioner's conviction, finding all of the grounds asserted to have been procedurally defaulted, while granting it as to his death sentence. A new sentencing hearing was therefore ordered. As to petitioner's conviction claims, the court noted that this was petitioner's third foray into the state judicial system, and thus he was obliged to have raised his new challenges to his conviction in earlier proceedings. His failure to do so barred appellate review. As to petitioner's sentencing claims, the court held that a federal circuit court's decision that the jury instructions on aggravating factors were unconstitutional was a decision that must be obeyed. The court also declined respondent state government's invitation to reweigh the aggravators and mitigators itself. Accordingly, petitioner's case was remanded to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial on the issue of possession of a controlled substance. A jury could not have reasonably inferred that defendant was in possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute. Although defendant was in an area known for the sale of crack cocaine, in the presence of a drug dealer, with one hand extended into a car and money in the other hand, those circumstances were not sufficient for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to distribute crack cocaine, as opposed to purchasing the drug. The fact that defendant was in a drug area and leaning into a car might have been indicative of a drug transaction, it gave no clue as to the identity of the seller. While the court could not guarantee defendant a perfect trial, it had to endeavor to ensure that defendant received a fair trial free of implied bias that arose from the presence of a juror who was related to an attorney employed by the district attorney's office that was prosecuting defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was in a car accident and sought damages from the state university and the employee. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the motorist argued that the sovereign immunity statutes were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal. The court held that its prior decision that declared the codified principle of sovereign immunity unconstitutional in 1992 did not apply retroactively because the Mississippi Constitution erected no barriers against legislation and it was the legislative branch's prerogative to address limitations upon actions against government entities. Additionally, the court held that the principle of sovereign immunity did not violate the due process clause of the state or federal constitutions because there was no infringement of a liberty or property right. The legislature had withheld that right through its statutes and there was no property right to bring an action against the state. Finally, the court was not able to reach a decision on the university employee's immunity because service of process was never obtained on the employee, and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-99 (Supp. 1992). Defendant alleged that he was immune from this charge because he was married to the victim and they were not living separate. The trial court refused instruction based on this defense. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the error required reversal because the refusal to grant the instruction deprived defendant of instructing the jury as to his only theory of defense.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence and held that because defendant failed to object at trial to the instruction, the objection was not properly preserved for review. The court held that even without the procedural bar, the claim was meritless. The court held that the statement defendant made to the police officer was properly excluded in the guilt phase under Miss. R. Evid. 804(b)(3). The court held that testimony regarding defendant's polygraph test was properly excluded because Mississippi law clearly stated that polygraph tests and their results were inadmissible. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mercy jury instruction. The court held that the jury was adequately instructed that before it could sentence defendant to death, it had to weigh mitigating circumstances against aggravating circumstances, and, only if the latter outweighed the former, could it return a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in all respects except the breadth of the injunction. The court concluded that the APL applied to rule-making by the governor and that the adoption of the CAP, as provided for in federal &quot;Superfund&quot; legislation, was such a rule within the APL. Further, the court determined that the circuit court did not err in concluding that there was a failure to comply with the APL. The court, however, found that the injunctive relief granted by the circuit court was overbroad and, thus, remanded for modification of the judgment. The court determined that appellants should be allowed to proceed with the permitting processes as they related to the non-CAP factors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was indicted for the crime of capital murder after being accused of killing a man by repeated blows to the head during a robbery at his home. The defendant pled not guilty, but the jury returned a guilty verdict and sentenced him to death by lethal injection. He appealed both the conviction and the sentence, contending the prosecution used its peremptory challenges in an unconstitutional manner to exclude potential black jurors, there were other problems with the jury venire, the prosecutor committed misconduct in his closings, the court failed to properly instruct the jury, and decisions related to the admission of evidence at his sentencing were error. The court found while evidence of the defendant's flight was improperly entered, it paled in comparison to more direct evidence of guilt. Its admission was harmless error. Moreover, the defendant's Batson challenges were rejected. Also, the prosecutor's remark did not rise to a level to suggest to the jury that someone other than the jury had the power to decide the defendant's sentence. Finally, even in the aggregate, any possible errors did not rise to the level of reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The conviction and sentence were affirmed by the court on direct appeal. The Fifth Circuit entered an order postponing any decision on the inmate's second petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc pending appellee state's resolution of the inmate's then pending third state court petition for post-conviction relief. Before the court was that petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The &quot;especially, heinous, atrocious or cruel&quot; aggravating factor found in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101 (5)(h) was submitted to the jury for consideration without a limiting or definitional instruction. The United States Supreme Court had since held that such an omission was error and potentially fatal to a death sentence. The court's task in death penalty cases where, as in the inmate's case, an unconstitutionally vague aggravator was submitted to the jury, was to review, not reweigh, the weighing of aggravating circumstances being a jury function pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101. The court's holding in three specified cases was viable precedent for vacating the death sentence and remanding the case to a state trial court for a new sentencing hearing. The court also determined that consideration and reconsideration of the inmate's allegation that he was entitled to relief from the guilt-finding phase because he was denied certain lesser included offense instructions was barred because the identical issue was considered and decided adversely to him on direct appeal and again on a motion for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the inmate's motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, his application for leave to file a motion to vacate death sentence, and his motion to vacate death sentence. The court also vacated the inmate's death sentence, denied his motion to stay proceedings, denied the state's motion to expedite, and remanded the case to a state trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court withdrew that portion of the original opinion finding an abuse of discretion in the failure to have awarded fees in the first judgment. To the extent that the chancellor's failure to award attorney's fees in the first order was an oversight that was not cured by the second award, the court remanded the matter for further proceedings. On remand, the chancery court could consider questions concerning waiver, timeliness, and the like, as well as the merits of the claim for attorney's fees and the effect of the second order, if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court accepted movant's pleas of guilty to two counts of robbery, one count of burglary, and one count of grand larceny and imposed sentence.

Movant argued that the trial court erred in conducting the evidentiary hearing without the presence of the prosecutor or a duly authorized assistant prosecutor. The court stated that examination of the transcript and all attached documents showed that the trial court could have denied movant's petition summarily pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-11(2) (1972) because the transcript and the supporting documents absolutely refuted the allegations raised by movant in his motion for relief. Even given the opportunity for a hearing, movant failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-23(7) that he was entitled to relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner sought review of a judgment from the Green County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which dismissed his pro se prisoner in form pauperis civil rights complaint against defendants, the corrections department commissioner, the corrections department superintendent, and three doctors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted for grand larceny, burglary, and armed robbery, the prisoner was housed in the state penitentiary. During his imprisonment, the prisoner contracted inactive tuberculosis. In substance, the prisoner asserted that defendants had knowledge of the contagious tuberculosis of an inmate he was housed with. The prisoner further alleged that after acquisition of such knowledge, defendants failed to provide proper care, housing, and medical treatment, which the prisoner suggested would have prevented him from contracting inactive tuberculosis. Upon review, the appellate court found that since the complaint was legally insufficient as a matter of law, the trial court judge did not commit reversible error in dismissing the prisoner's complaint. The trial court's utilization of the Spears evidentiary hearing was proper in determining whether the prisoner's complaint was frivolous. The subsequent dismissal of the prisoner's complaint was proper under Miss. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and the frivolous standard because the prisoner failed to prove that any action of defendants caused him to contract tuberculosis from the other inmate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged that defendant had three prior DUI convictions. Defendant was found guilty at a second jury trial. At the sentencing hearing, the State offered abstracts of court records attesting to defendant's three prior convictions for DUI. Defendant testified that when he pled guilty to the prior charges, he was not represented by counsel, nor was he given warnings as to possible enhanced punishment if charged with a similar offense in the future. Defendant claimed that he was not aware that he could be charged with a felony. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. Defendant's prior convictions were admissible at the sentencing hearing for enhancement of his punishment. Defendant was unsuccessful in overcoming the presumption of validity accorded his earlier DUI convictions, and lack of counsel did not render a conviction arising from a guilty plea irregular or otherwise unfit for purposes of sentence enhancement. The introduction of defendant's prior convictions at the sentencing hearing did not violate Miss. Unif. Crim. R. Cir. Ct. P. 4.06 since defendant was on notice that the State would use these convictions to enhance his sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was apprehended in Tennessee on unrelated charges and Tennessee law enforcement officials began interrogating defendant.

Defendant was convicted of murder during the commission of a robbery, adjudicated a habitual offender, and sentenced to death; the trial court denied his motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court stated that defendant previously requested an attorney and had not initiated a conversation with Mississippi officers, therefore the confession was inadmissible. The court ruled the Mississippi officers were not entitled to subject defendant to further interrogation unless counsel had been made available or defendant initiated further communication. The court also held extradition was not improper, peremptory challenges strikes were not unconstitutional, and the admission of evidence of other crimes was proper. The court further stated that the state made discovery available in a timely manner and other contentions of error were barred, meritless, or moot.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the revocation proceedings. A trial court ordered the revocation of defendant's suspended sentence. On appeal, the court concluded that defendant was never placed on probation and no terms or conditions had been established for the revocation of defendant's suspended sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary, conspiracy, and rape. His co-defendant pleaded guilty to burglary and conspiracy. The state dropped the rape charge against the co-defendant and he testified against defendant. Defendant was found guilty of burglary and conspiracy in his first trial. A mistrial was ordered on the rape charge after the jury could not agree on defendant's guilt or innocence. Defendant was retried on the rape charge and convicted. On appeal, defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence; instead, he claimed his case should have been dismissed because he was not timely prosecuted. The court affirmed his convictions, finding that, there was no violation of the 270-day rule. The court found that although defendant filed his motion to dismiss 273 days after arraignment, the motion was premature because the statute had been tolled at least 37 days by plea negotiations and a continuance at the end of one term of court carrying the case over to the next term. The statute was again tolled between the time of the motion to dismiss and the hearing on the motion. As such, a total of 264 days had lapsed and, therefore, the 270-day rule was not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Lowndes County Circuit Court (Mississippi) convicted defendant of capital murder and imposed the death penalty. Defendant appealed and raised 26 assignments of error including that the jury venire's death qualification process violated U.S. Const. amends. VI, VIII, and XIV, and that the imposition of the death penalty for a juvenile violated U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV, and Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that issues that were not properly raised in the trial court were procedurally barred from consideration. Nonetheless, the court reviewed all of defendant's claims. After careful consideration, the court found defendant's claims to be without merit. Initially, the court reviewed the guilt phase of the proceedings. The court held that defendant was not denied the opportunity to interrogate the venire on the issue of the death penalty, and in fact did question the venire members about their views on the death penalty and whether it should be imposed in the event of a murder conviction. The jury knew that the death sentence was not automatic and that they were not required to impose a death sentence. The court then reviewed the sentencing phase. Defendant failed to bring a motion pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-159(3) (1992) for his case to be sent back to the youth court. Similarly, defendant failed to bring a motion for a special hearing for persons under the age of 18 who were charged with a capital offense. Finally, imposition of the death penalty on defendant as a 17 year-old offender did not constitute a per se violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the statute's reimbursement payment to the county of $ 10 per day per prisoner was inadequate to carry out the legislative purpose of relieving overcrowding in the state penitentiary. The trial court construed the language of the statute to include reimbursement for all actual costs incurred by the county for the housing of state inmates. The trial court also found that the statute operated to tax citizens of the county on a basis peculiar only to the county in violation of Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 112. The court found that the action was not barred by sovereign immunity because the county sought a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. However, the court found that the county enjoyed no constitutional right that was violated. The court held that the fact that the legislature chose to pay the county only $ 10 per day per prisoner did not make the statute inadequate to relieve overcrowding and that if the legislature had intended to pay all costs, it would not have placed a cap on the compensation. The court also ruled that nothing in &sect; 112 affected the validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the propriety of his sentence even though he had waived his right to parole. Defendant had been convicted of murder, kidnapping, and aggravated assault. The issue before the court was whether the trial court erred in its holdings that the waiver of defendant's future right to apply for parole was valid and the no parole provision was a valid part of the sentence. The court concluded that enforcement of the contract between defendant and the state would result in a sentence not authorized by law. The court held that a life sentence qualified by the preclusion of parole was not available to defendant. The court concluded that defendant had the right to be sentenced by a jury and the State once again had the right to seek the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bingo winner challenged a decision from the Harrison County Chancery Court, Second Judicial District (Mississippi), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, management company and the Mississippi Coast Coliseum Commission based on its finding that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 87-1-1 (1972) barred suit for the collection of winnings from legal bingo games.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-51 exempted charitable bingo games from the definition of illegal gambling. Thus, bingo was a lawful activity, not a lottery, and the winner could maintain an action to collect her winnings, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 87-1-5. The winner also argued that the trial court erred in denying her request to amend her complaint and that no written findings or basis for the denial were contained in the order denying the request. The court held that motions for leave to amend were left to the sound discretion of the trial court and were not to be reversed absent abuse of discretion. However, leave to amend was to be freely given when justice so required. It was apparent that the proposed amended complaint contained additional theories of recovery, stemming from the same transactions and events. The court ruled that there were genuine issues in dispute as to material facts which precluded summary disposition. Because no grounds were given for the denial of the motion to amend, there was no guide whereby the court could determine if there was an abuse of discretion. Thus, remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision which granted summary judgment to the management company and commission for failing to pay bingo winnings because there were numerous facts in dispute and the trial court had committed manifest error in denying the winner's request to amend her pleadings without an explanation.</SPAN></P>

The federal retirees cross-appealed on the denial of their motion for certification of a class action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal retirees sought refunds of state income taxes paid under a tax scheme that was unconstitutional based on its differential treatment of federal retirees from that of the state's own retired employees. After being denied relief by the commission, the federal retirees sought declaratory relief from the trial court. The trial court denied the federal retirees' motion for class certification. However, based a prior decision, the trial court found that the tax scheme at issue was unconstitutional and held that the federal retirees were entitled to a refund pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-7-313 (1989). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The plain words of &sect; 27-7-313 provided that any overpayment of state taxes for any reason shall be refunded to the taxpayer. Thus, the federal retirees clearly were entitled to refunds. The amendment to &sect; 27-7-313 during the pendency of the action did not accord with due process requirements. Nothing in &sect; 27-7-313 required that the payment of taxes be under protest in order to get a refund. The Rules of Civil Procedure enacted by the state intentionally omitted Rule 23 pertaining to class actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court holding that the state tax scheme was unconstitutional and that the federal retirees were entitled to refunds as a matter of state law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a delinquency action, appellee truant contested testimony by a school attendance officer on the grounds that the officer's position violated Miss. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, the separation of powers provision. Although Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-13-91 came to the court clothed with a heavy presumption of validity, the court found that the truant met his required burden. The State alleged that the attendance officer was a local office and that the separation of powers provision applied only to state governmental positions. The court found that the officer was a position within the executive branch of the state government. Therefore, because the youth court judge was a part of the state judicial system, the judge's selection of the officer was a violation of the separation of powers. Further, the court found that Miss. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 made no distinction between ministerial and discretionary duties. Thus, even if the officer's duties were ministerial, the separation of powers would be violated. Because of the finding of unconstitutionality, the county judge divested himself of any authority over the officers. Therefore, the judge was without authority to reassign the officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the finding of unconstitutionality but reversed that part of the judgment that placed the attendance officers under the jurisdiction of the department of education.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a temporary restraining order allowing student to play. Association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged regulation prohibited any student from participating in interscholastic athletics unless he resided in the district where he attended school. The court held that the regulation's constitutionality was a moot question in this case; however, the case was capable of repetition, yet evading review, and therefore was reviewable. The court held that the rule was a form of state action; however, there was no property interest in participation in high school athletics, so no procedural due process analysis was necessary. As to substantive due process, student's right to travel was not impermissibly burdened because no penalty was imposed on the exercise of the right. The regulation did not interfere with any religious practice. The regulation was rationally related to the state's interest in promoting fair competition and preventing overzealous recruiting. As to student's equal protection claim, the classification at issue, based on bona fide residence requirements, was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of deterring recruitment practices and encouraging fair competition. The court concluded that the anti-recruitment rule was constitutional and enforceable.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 21-23-5 (1972) was constitutional because the separation of powers doctrine applied to the state and not to municipalities, which were governed by charters and other statutes enacted by the legislature. Nonetheless, under the authority of Miss. Const. art. 6, &sect; 177A, the court proscribed the use of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-23-5 (1972), finding the functions of the offices of mayor and judge inherently incompatible. The offices being held by the same person promoted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, which brought the judiciary into disrepute and could potentially violate a defendant's right to due process. The court's concern as to the one judge who appeared was to remove all appearance of the impropriety of a city's chief executive also presiding over the court cases that generated fines that were a source of revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court accepted the recommendation of the Commission and ordered that the municipal judges be suspended according to statute and the rules of the Commission. The court also determined that the statute at issue would have no future application in Mississippi.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit involving the constitutionality of 1989 Tidelands Legislation enacted by the Mississippi Legislature, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-15-1 et seq. (Supp. 1991), and arising out of plaintiff's claim of adverse possession of low-lying property along a certain bayou, to which defendant asserted record title, an appeal was taken from the Jackson County Chancery Court (Mississippi). On the appeal, the parties were the state and its secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit arose from the subject claim of adverse possession. The upland was adjacent to tidelands across which private persons had dredged a canal and basin between 1952 and 1959. The spoils were deposited on tidelands that were then, and remained, below mean high tide. The involvement of the tidelands implicated and made the state a party. The subject land was located within the area of the Special Management Area Plan adopted by the federal government and the state. As the appeal addressed the same question as to the constitutionality of the Tidelands Legislation presented in another suit decided concurrently, the dispositive issue on appeal in the case sub judice involved constitutional questions, and there were no unique issues of fact or law, the holding in the other case governed the case before the court and warranted a reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered a decision, holding that the court's decision rendered the same day in another related case controlled the disposition of all salient issues raised in the case sub judice.</SPAN></P>

The vehicle in which the child was riding as a passenger was knocked off of a bridge. The complaint charged the county's supervisor with negligently permitting grass to grow along the bridge, failing to post warning signs and rails on the bridge, permitting holes in the bridge, and maintaining a dangerously narrow bridge. The county was charged with vicarious liability. The court held that, generally, county supervisors were immune from liability for injuries sustained as a result of the negligent maintenance of public roads. Here, however, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 65-21-1 mandated that any bridge was to be built or rebuilt at a certain width and with banisters at either side. The court held that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the supervisor exceeded his authority in rebuilding a one-lane bridge without adequate warnings. Construction of road bridges in accordance with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 65-21-1 was a ministerial function. Accordingly, the supervisor was not protected by qualified immunity. The court affirmed that the county enjoyed sovereign immunity under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-1 et seq. (Supp. 1985).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected all of the challenges to the legislation's constitutionality and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court rejected the secretary's claims that the legislature had no authority to authorize the sale of tidelands to private individuals, holding that such sale was an incident to the overall public interest and purpose in accommodating an expanding population, commerce, tourism and recreation. The court noted that the sale of individual lots to private owners could not be separated from the general context of the overall public purposes involved in the legislation. The court also concluded that because the legislation was an effort to manage and protect the public trust lands, it was a general, and not a local or private law; that the legislation was not unconstitutionally vague; and that the legislation did not grant the secretary the power to make laws, which would violate the separation of powers principles. The court also rejected the individual's claim that the duties delegated to the secretary by the legislation were quasi-judicial and therefore constitutionally impermissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police based on a tip from a confidential informant that defendant was dealing in crack stopped defendant and found cocaine in his car after he consented to a search.

The court rejected defendant's contention that the police did not have probable cause for the stop and that the search and seizure of his car violated the Fourth Amendment and Miss. Const. &sect; 23. The court held probable cause was not a prerequisite for a brief investigatory stop, when the police had reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that criminal activity was afoot. The court found the police corroborated the informant's information and that the stop was lawful. The court held defendant neither denied that the substance found in his car was not cocaine or that it did not belong to him. The court held there was insufficient proof of the necessary nexus between the money and the cocaine to warrant its seizure pursuant to Miss Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-153(a)(5), (a)(7) (Supp. 1993) because the money found on defendant's person was not in close proximity to his car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder, and sentenced to death by lethal injection in a separate hearing.

Additionally, the court concluded that the trial court did not make any reversible errors in the sentencing phase of the trial, as the death sentence imposed upon defendant was proportionate when compared to other cases where the death penalty had been imposed in the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney filed suit in state court to recover payment for services provided to the client in the successful defense of a criminal matter. The client removed the case to federal district court on diversity grounds. The district court granted summary judgment, holding that the action was subject to a one-year statute of limitations applicable to unwritten contracts of employment. When the attorney appealed that decision, the federal appellate court certified a question as to the appropriate statute of limitations. The court held the one-year statute of limitations for actions on unwritten contracts of employment in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-29 (Supp. 1992), applied only to traditional employer-employee situations and did not apply to an unwritten contract between an attorney and client for legal representation. The court found that a contract for an attorney's services was not synonymous with an employment contract because the client was not concerned with controlling the attorney's work, rather the client was concerned with receiving a skilled defense. Therefore the suit was subject to the three-year statute of limitations for an action on an unwritten contract.</SPAN></P>

Section 27-27-12 provided an exception from &sect; 97-33-7 for antique coin machines. The court stated that defendant's case had not proceeded to final judgment. Defendant's due process remained an issue pending a final determination as to whether the machines fell within the explicit exception provided for in &sect; 27-27-12, which was enacted to protect and preserve the slot machine's place in the state's history. If defendant could show that the seized slot machines were at least 25 years old and were not connected with any unlawful gambling activities, then the machines should be returned to defendant pursuant to &sect; 27-27-12.

Later, two town employees disconnected the propane tanks of certain residents. After a flurry of litigation, the trial court issued an order declaring the ordinance unconstitutional and unenforceable, and permanently enjoined the town from enforcing the ordinance. The trial court held the town in civil contempt for violating the temporary injunction. The town appealed. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and dismissed the case.

Defendant's motion was based on a U.S. Supreme Court decision that required reversal of the sentence of death because of an erroneous instruction to the jury on especially heinous crimes. The court reversed defendant's sentence and remanded for a new trial on sentencing. Several of defendant's claims were waived pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(1) (Supp. 1993) when he did not raise them on direct appeal. He could not show cause or actual prejudice with respect to the guilt phase of his trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's convictions and sentences of death, defendant filed a motion for leave to file a motion to vacate the death sentences asserting that the sentencing instructions foreclosed the jury's proper consideration of mitigating circumstances. Thereafter, the state filed a motion to reconsider through which it asked the court to engage in harmless error analysis on the same issue. The court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101 (Supp. 1992) required that the jury had to make the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors, and if it were to engage in such analysis, it would run afoul of previous a previous decision rendered by the United States Supreme Court, which stated that appellate reweighing violated the federal due process requirements because &sect; 99-19-101 would not be complied with. Accordingly, &sect; 99-19-101 prevented the court from performing either reweighing or harmless error analysis as a matter of state law. Further, defendant's motion for leave to file a second post-conviction petition was granted, and defendant's motion to vacate the death sentences was also granted.</SPAN></P>

Finding that the permittee had standing, the Hinds County Chancery Court (Mississippi) determined that Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission's order was based on its finding that an employee of the permittee's package store sold liquor to a prohibited purchaser in violation of &sect; 67-1-83(2). The Commission's argued on appeal, inter alia, that the chancery court erred in finding that the permittee had standing to attack the constitutionality of &sect; 67-1-83(2). The court agreed, holding that the Commission properly suspended the permittee's package store license because the permittee framed his entire attack against &sect; 67-1-83(2) on his view that the statute was defective in its failure to provide notice and a hearing to the prohibited purchaser. However, the permittee clearly lacked standing to raise such argument because he was not prejudiced by any failure of due process in the operation of the statute. Therefore, the chancery court erred in finding that the permittee had standing to assert a challenge on this point. The permittee was fully informed of the decision to prohibit alcohol sales to the prohibited purchaser. A notice was first mailed and another was hand-delivered to the permittee's package store with instructions to post a photograph of the prohibited purchaser.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and rendered the chancery court's decision. Accordingly, the order of the Commission was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the Commission's assessment of additional income tax and interest against the foreign corporation. On appeal, the foreign corporation maintained that the Commission acted arbitrarily and without statutory authority. The court found that since both parties conceded that the foreign corporation's operation was a multi-state unitary operation, its &quot;business income&quot; was subject to apportionment because it could not be allocated to any particular state and direct or separate accounting for Mississippi net business income was impossible. Taking the statute as a whole, the court held that the Commission correctly determined that the dividends were subject to apportionment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While acting in the course and scope of employment, an uninsured motorist had an accident, and a co-employee died. After numerous claims were filed against the employer, plaintiff insurer filed an interpleader action against defendant wrongful death beneficiaries, having defendants assert rights to the amounts due under the insurance policy. Thereafter, defendants asserted a right to the uninsured motorist benefits. As workers' compensation benefits had been paid to defendants, the court held the workers' compensation remedy had been exclusive, thereby prohibiting defendants from reaching the uninsured motorist benefits. Following a grant of summary judgment in plaintiff's favor, defendants sought review, and the court affirmed. Initially, the court noted that under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 71-3-9 (1972), workers' compensation was the exclusive remedy for a work-related injury caused by a co-employee. Interpreting the phrase &quot;legally entitled to recover&quot; found in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 83-11-101 (1972), the court held uninsured motorist coverage had not been mandated because the tortfeasor, who had been the deceased's co-employee, was immune from liability under &sect; 71-3-9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment which held decedent, as the co-employee of an uninsured motorist, was not entitled to recover from the uninsured motorist policy of decedent's employer because workers' compensation had been decedent's exclusive remedy. The court held that because the exclusivity of workers' compensation had protected the co-employee, the decedent had not been &quot;legally entitled to recover&quot; under the uninsured motorist statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellee counterclaimed for the automobile liability policy limit and asserted a claim for a second payment of the policy limits of appellee's insurance binder with appellant because the first payment was not court approved. Appellant sought review after the chancellor awarded appellee the proceeds, the additional policy limit, unconditional punitive damages for bad faith, and conditional punitive damages if appellant failed to satisfy certain corrective and preventive measures described in the judgment. The court held that there was no requirement that the lower court choose between the in-state and the out-of-state law for purposes of assessing punitive damages. The court affirmed the unconditional punitive damages because the lower court reached the proper result. The attorney fees, expenses, and prejudgment interest awards were affirmed because the punitive damages were proper. The court reversed and rendered the conditional punitive damage award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found the former husband liable for certain unpaid medical bills of his former wife, which were incurred prior to their divorce. On appeal, the former husband asserted that liability to third party creditors for debts incurred by his former wife during their marriage was a violation of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as a violation of Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 94. Finding that, absent any express agreement with a third party to do so, a spouse was not obligated to pay the debts of the other, the court reversed the decision of the circuit court. The court found that the circuit court erred in finding the former husband liable for his former wife's hospital bill. Nothing in Mississippi jurisprudence obligated one spouse to be liable to a third party for the debts of the other without express consent. To hold otherwise would have violated Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 94, and opened the door for either spouse to control or deplete the other's separate estate.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the specific statute of &sect; 15-1-25 preempted the general statute of &sect; 15-1-49.

The court rejected this contention, holding that defendant failed to prove that the information contained in the affidavit was false or misleading. Defendant next contended that the trial court erred in admitting evidence seized from defendant's automobile. The police had a warrant for defendant's house but not his car.

The court further held that although the retailer may not have been a state resident, it was undisputed that the claimant was a state resident, so coverage was extended under &sect; 83-23-109(c). The court also held that the claimant had not been required to obtain a judgment against the retailer prior to seeking coverage from the reinsurer.

The court disagreed, holding that the state constitution granted citizens the right to challenge the constitutionality and/or review of governmental action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a first federal request for habeas corpus, petitioner's sentence was again presented to a jury. The resentencing jurors were instructed they could consider the &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel element&quot; as an aggravating circumstance, but it denied petitioner's request to define the meaning of those terms. The jury again assessed the death penalty. Petitioner again exhausted his state remedies and filed a second federal request for habeas corpus. While that was pending, petitioner filed the successive motion to vacate his sentence, asserting that he was entitled to a determination if he was eligible for resentencing based on two recent decisions. Because the decisions did not announce new rules, they were applicable. In one, the court had held that it was error to give the heinous, atrocious, or cruel element instruction without defining the terms. The second case held it was up to the court considering the motion to vacate to determine if the invalid instruction constituted harmless error. No court had yet considered it. The appellate court could not determine what sentence a capital jury would have returned in the absence of the invalid aggravator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, purchaser of tires stolen by false pretenses, filed an action against appellees, owners of store where tires were stolen, police officers, and the city, alleging malicious prosecution and deprivation of property in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Harrison County Circuit Court (Mississippi) granted a motion for a directed verdict against the purchaser, holding that his claim was time barred and he had not made a prima facie case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser bought tires from an individual who obtained the tires from the tire storeowners through the use of worthless checks. The purchaser then sold some of the tires to a third party. The grand jury brought back an indictment against the individual who presented worthless checks and directed that the tires be recovered. The police recovered the tires from the third party and the purchaser. The purchaser won a suit brought by the third party for claim and delivery. The court first reversed the holding that the purchaser's suit was barred by the statute of limitations. The court applied the six-year rule for the &sect; 1983 claim and the one-year rule for the malicious prosecution claim, and found that the purchaser's time to act accrued when the trial court entered a nolle prosequi. The court affirmed the circuit court's holding that the purchaser had not presented a prima facie case of malicious prosecution because he failed to prove one or all of the six elements. The storeowners were not state actors for purposes of the &sect; 1983 claim, and the police officers had qualified immunity. Since the city did not have a policy or custom of the objectionable conduct it was not liable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the directed verdict that held that the purchaser's action was time-barred, but held that the directed verdict was correct as to his claims of malicious prosecution and deprivation of property because he did not make a prima facie showing of the elements of malicious prosecution or of liability under &sect; 1983. There was no abuse of discretion in the denial of attorney's fees on behalf of the defendants.</SPAN></P>

The court found that although self-help repossession was permitted in Mississippi, appellee did commit a breach of the peace during the repossession. The court determined that the trial court did not commit any reversible errors during the course of the trial and thus dismissed appellee's arguments in support of a new trial.

The court vacated defendant's death penalty and remanded to the circuit court for resentencing. Defendant's capital murder conviction was undisturbed. During defendant's appeals the United State Supreme Court ruled that the aggravating circumstance of &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel&quot; was unconstitutionally vague when given without a limiting instruction. The court concluded that the Supreme Court's decision was an intervening decision that adversely affected the outcome of defendant's conviction and sentence and excepted defendant from the successive writ bar.

The jury found for the lover on the alienation count, but awarded damages, actual and punitive, to the husband on the conversation count. On appeal, the court reversed and rendered. The court held that the tort of criminal conversation had outlived its usefulness. The tort was not more or less than an act of adultery between the lover and the husband's spouse, and 32 states had already abolished the tort, either by legislative enactment or judicial decree. Mississippi offered no general crime of adultery, nor was there any intent to give an individual a private cause of action in such a case. Because the tort had been created at common law, it could also be taken away at common law, without causing constitutional problems. As such, the court held that it was ceasing to recognize the tort of criminal conversation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to the charge of attempted rape. Defendant was sentenced to serve 10 years in the penitentiary. Subsequently, defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Defendant's attempted rape conviction was used as an aggravating circumstance at the sentencing phase of his capital murder trial. The trial court denied defendant's post-conviction motion because he was barred by the three year statute of limitations found in &sect; 99-39-5(2) of the UPCCRA. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's request for post-conviction relief. The court rejected defendant's contention that the statute of limitations was tolled due to his incompetence. Further, the court found that the time bar was constitutional. The court also rejected defendant's arguments that there were intervening decisions that excepted him from the time bar and that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, administratrix and as wrongful death beneficiary, filed a wrongful death action against appellee state highway commission for negligent design of the warning signs at an intersection after her daughter was killed in a car accident. The circuit court sustained defendant's motion to dismiss on the grounds that defendant was immune from suit under section 3 of the Sovereign Immunity Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-6 (Supp. 1991). The court reversed the circuit court judgment, holding that &sect; 11-46-6 was unconstitutional and void to the extent that it required the court to determine sovereign immunity by applying the case law as it existed five years prior to the court's decision in a 1982 case in which the court abolished all judicially-created state and political subdivisions' sovereign immunity existing under the common law of Mississippi. The court held that &sect; 11-46-6 required the court to apply legal principles which the court had specifically rejected and improperly delegated authority to the court which came perilously close to delegation of the power to legislate on the particular subject, which under Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 33 only the legislature could do.</SPAN></P>

The minor was only six years old at the time of the trial. A voir dire examination was held before she was allowed to testify to determine if she was competent. The court found that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in finding that she was a competent witness under Miss. R. Evid. 601. Defendant also argued that the lower court erred in allowing the state to cross-examine him concerning an out of court signed statement. The trial judge found that, based on the evidence, the statement was voluntarily given and that the statement was inconsistent with defendant's direct testimony. Even though the statement could not be introduced into evidence due to Miranda violations, the trial judge held that it could be used for impeachment purposes. The court found that defendant's signed statement, although inadmissible in the state's case-in-chief, was properly used to impeach his testimony.</SPAN></P>

He was dead on arrival when defendant brought him to the hospital. When defendant was questioned about her son's injuries, she gave conflicting statements. Defendant did not testify at trial and argued that the prosecutor made prejudicial remarks about that fact to the jury. During the closing, the prosecutor stated in two instances that defendant had not yet told the jury the whole truth and then asked the jury if that was what an innocent person did. Defendant's objections to these comments were overruled. The court reversed the conviction, remanded for a new trial, and held that the prosecutor's comments were so egregious that even if there had been no objection at trial, the court had no choice but to reverse the conviction. The court also found that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury under the manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-27 as authorized under Miss.

He was found guilty of manslaughter on all three counts and he was also found to be a habitual offender. Defendant was sentenced to three consecutive 20-year sentences. On appeal, defendant complained of eight errors in the trial and sentence. The court affirmed because the trial court had not improperly excluded evidence that the deaths were caused by defects in the decedents' car. In addition, the admission of photographs of the victims in connection with the medical examiners testimony was not unduly prejudicial but the use of a photograph of defendant was not relevant, although it was not prejudicial. The court held that the admission of evidence of other crimes was irrelevant but was not prejudicial. Corroborated evidence of defendant's driving behavior just before the accident was properly admitted. As to the sentences, the fact that defendant had not served prior felony sentences in prison was irrelevant under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (Supp. 1991), there was no evidence that his prior guilty pleas were not voluntary, and the sentences were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two victims were murdered during the course of an armed robbery in which defendant participated. Defendant's conviction was based upon his confession. The evidence revealed that a sheriff obtained warrants for defendant's arrest on the basis of information provided by confidential informants. Defendant was taken into custody and confessed after three days of incarceration and repeated interrogation. Defendant was also given a polygraph test. Defendant was not provided with an initial appearance or access to counsel until after he had confessed. The court reversed defendant's conviction, vacated and set aside his death sentence, and remanded. Defendant's confession was involuntary and inadmissible because (1) it was proximately caused by improper inducements and promises by law enforcement interrogators and third parties, (2) defendant had not voluntarily waived his rights to remain silent and to counsel, and (3) the state failed to provide defendant with a prompt initial hearing. Moreover, the trial court erred in setting aside defendant's death sentence because the evidence justified the jury's finding that defendant possessed the necessary level of culpability.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the 378-day delay from arrest to trial constituted a presumptively prejudicial delay, so that the State bore the burden of proving no prejudice to defendant. The court noted the four events that caused the delay of defendant's trial: first, defendant moved for a change of venue, which tolled the clock; second, the State successfully moved for a continuance, which did not toll the clock; third, defendant moved to suppress identification, which tolled the clock and caused defendant to miss a trial date; and last, the missed trial date pushed the trial into the next term, several months away. The court found that no constitutional or statutory right to a speedy trial was denied defendant because, despite the fact that he went to trial 378 days after his arrest, his constitutional speedy trial clock ran for only 164 days, or just over five months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spouses were employees of a school district. The trial court found that the state constitution proscribed an employment contract wherein a public school board employed one whose spouse was a member of the board. The spouses contended that Miss.

The court was of the opinion that this contention was meritless. The court held where there were no genuine issues of material fact and no necessity for trial by it, the trial court was not concerned with the burden of proof because there were no issues to be tried. The spouses argued that summary judgment was not applicable to their proceeding. The court held there was no violation of the right of trial by jury when judgment was entered summarily in cases where there was no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his request for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because there was no evidence that he personally removed any of the victim's property and that the State hung its assault charge solely on the testimony of an accomplice whose story was self-contradictory and substantially impeached. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence of defendant's involvement in the crime to justify submission of the charge to the jury because defendant conceded that the accomplice's testimony created a question of fact for the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the jury of capital murder and sentenced to death. The jury was allowed to consider the aggravating circumstance that the crime was &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; along with two others, &quot;engaged in the commission of a robbery&quot; and &quot;committed for pecuniary gain.&quot; There was no limiting instruction given in conjunction with the &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; aggravating circumstance. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded to the court to reconsider the issue of aggravating circumstance in light of its opinion in another case. The issue was whether in the face of the invalid aggravating circumstance the court could nonetheless uphold defendant's death sentence or whether the case should be remanded for resentencing. The court held while the conviction could remain undisturbed, the court was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that under the facts, the jury would have found that the actual commission of the capital felony was accompanied by such additional acts as to set the crime apart from the norm of capital felonies as a conscienceless or pitiless crime which was unnecessarily tortious to the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant North Mississippi Utility Company (NMUC) sought review of a judgment of the DeSoto County Chancery Court (Mississippi), which declared the notice provisions of the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission (PSC) and applicable parts of the Mississippi Code unconstitutional for lack of procedural due process to NMUC's customers. Appellee customers supported affirmance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">NMUC filed notices of intent to increase rates. The PSC reviewed the notice and entered a suspension order. The commission received numerous telephone calls and letters of protest from the customers objecting to the increase. Notice of the rate change was published in a major newspaper pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 77-3-47 (1991) advising of the right to intervene. No customer, however, intervened or sought intervention pursuant to the PSC rules. The chancery court found in favor of the customers in their appeal of the PSC's order setting rates and charges. NMUC and the PSC asserted that the chancery court erred in determining that the notice provisions of the Public Utilities Act and the PSC's rules were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed due to a lack of jurisdiction in the chancery court. The court determined that the customers failed to avail themselves of their rights to intervene. The court concluded that their failure to do so was fatal because having failed to intervene, they never became parties. They were not, therefore, a &quot;party aggrieved by any final finding&quot; and had no right to appeal from the final order of the PSC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the chancery court and dismissed the proceedings for want of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The widow claimed that the trial judge erred in failing to exclude certain jurors for cause and in allowing the doctor to exercise peremptory challenges to exclude African American jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During jury selection, the widow, who was African American, challenged for cause several potential jurors because they or their family members had been treated by the doctor. The trial court sustained some of the challenges and denied others. The doctor, who was Caucasian, exercised all of his peremptory challenges to exclude African Americans from the jury. When asked to state a racially neutral basis for the challenges, the doctor's attorney stated that he had not challenged other African Americans. The trial court determined that a racially neutral basis for the peremptory challenges was unnecessary in a civil case. On appeal, the court held that although the trial court may have erred in failing to excuse a juror for cause, the error was not a basis for reversal because the widow could have had him excused on a peremptory challenge. However, the court held that the failure to show a race neutral reason for using peremptory challenges to exclude the African Americans from the jury warranted a new trial although in some cases only an evidentiary hearing was necessary to determine the existence of a race neutral basis for the peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion to vacate his guilty plea, which the circuit court denied. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that defendant's application for post-conviction relief was time barred under the Post-Conviction Relief Act, &sect; 99-39-5, Mississippi Code 1972 Annotated. The act applied prospectively from its date of enactment, and individuals convicted prior to that date had three years from the enactment date to petition for post-conviction relief. Where defendant's motion was filed more than four years after the enactment date, it was untimely. The court refused to consider defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional. The court could not pass upon a question that was not raised before the circuit court, and the rule that questions not raised in the lower court would not be reviewed on appeal was particularly true where constitutional questions were involved. Such questions were waived if not asserted at the trial level.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the capital murder of a state trooper, and the jury sentenced him to death. On appeal, defendant raised several contentions regarding whether his substantial right to a fair trial was compromised during either the guilt or penalty phase of his trial. On appeal, the trial court reviewed all of defendant's claimed errors relative to the guilt phase of his trial and determined that any viable claims of error merely constituted harmless errors that did not require reversal. Notably, the court concluded that prosecution should not have been permitted to question a witness on her statement in offense of defendant's Confrontation Clause rights under state and federal constitutions; however, overwhelming evidence in support of defendant's guilt rendered the error harmless. Additionally, the court determined that the trial court made no errors in the penalty phase of defendant's trial. Accordingly, the trial court's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

While writing the citation, the officer was informed that the arrestee had previously been convicted of controlled substance possession. The officer asked the arrestee, who at that time was not under arrest, to sign a consent form for a vehicle search, which the arrestee did. An arrest was made after the arrestee admitted that a marijuana cigarette was his and a large amount of money was found. The arrestee claimed that he had asked continuously for an attorney. The trial court granted the State's petition for forfeiture of the cash found and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the arrestee's consent to the search was valid. The arrestee did not put on any proof of duress or coercion. The only evidence presented to support the arrestee's contention that the search was invalid was his own testimony, which the trial court had the sole authority of judging for veracity. The arrestee was informed of his right to consent and he was Mirandized after being detained.

On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and rendered judgment in favor of the lounge. The court held that, where a statute has a standard which is subjective, and can be interpreted differently by some people as opposed to others, the statute effectively has no standard at all. The court noted that a noise ordinance touches the first amendment freedom of speech and, as such, is subjected to heightened scrutiny. The court noted the testimony of the police chief, who admitted that the interpretation of the ordinance depended on what any given complainant considered &quot;annoying&quot;.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant contended the breath test was given with less than a 15-minute observation period from the time of the arrest when the testing procedures required a 20-minute period. The court held there was no merit with the issue, as the officer was not required to stare at defendant and there was 15 minutes between the arrest and administration of the test and the defendant was observed for at least 8 to 10 minutes prior to arrest. Both defendants contended they were denied due process when their request for the appointment of an expert in the field of the testing device was denied. The court held there was no abuse of discretion, as defendants had the state's experts who were available for rigorous cross-examination. The court determined the sentences, three-months in excess of the six-month maximum under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30(1)(c) (Supp. 1988), were proper, as the sentences were within the maximum allowed under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-13-19. Also, when defendants filed their appeals for trial de novo in the circuit court, they took the chance the penalties would have been enhanced. Finally, in affirming, the court held the intoxilyzer test was valid and properly administered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Harrison County Circuit Court, First Judicial District (Mississippi) that convicted him for capital murder and sentenced him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the capital murder of a state trooper, and the jury sentenced him to death. On appeal, defendant raised several contentions regarding whether his substantial right to a fair trial was compromised. The court determined that any viable claims of error merely constituted harmless error that did not require reversal. Notably, the court held that: (1) although the circuit court erred when it denied defendant's motion for a preliminary hearing, the error was harmless; (2) although the circuit court erred when it refused defendant's request for voir dire examination of two prospective jurors who had stated their opposition to the death penalty, the error was harmless; and (3) although the circuit court's error in allowing the prosecution to attempt a cross-examination of defendant's adverse witness, who invoked her self-incrimination privilege, regarding her prior statement to a police officer offended defendant's Confrontation Clause rights, the error was harmless. The court concluded that overwhelming evidence in support of defendant's guilt rendered the errors harmless. Accordingly, the circuit court's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence of death and remanded for re-sentencing. The court held that defendant's utterance regarding the possible exercise of his right to an attorney during questioning was ambiguous, but that the detectives properly clarified the ambiguity, and thereafter, defendant waived his Miranda rights and the confession was properly admitted. The court held that evidentiary rulings were proper with respect to: 1) exclusion of impeachment testimony of another witness's alleged sexual fantasies of the victim; 2) the admission of a video of the burial site and a wash cloth found there, which were inadmissible but harmless error; 3) admission of a doctor's opinions as to the time of bruising, which objection was waived; and 4) the timeliness of rape kit samples. The court held that instructions on the lesser included offense of manslaughter were properly denied. However, the court held that the jury's premature decision to impose the death sentence, which came after the guilt phase but before the sentencing phase, constituted reversible error where the trial court's instruction was insufficient to insure defendant's right to a fair hearing.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the forfeiture because there was not an innocent owner exception &sect; 49-7-103 (1972). On review, the court reversed because Miss.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-7-251 to 257 (1972) was violative of the Mississippi Constitution's due process guarantee. The court construed the statute to include an innocent owner exception. Moreover, forfeiture statutes were penal in nature and had to be strictly construed. The burden was upon the State to prove forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were awarded compensation in a condemnation action for property located on a frontage road to a highway.

The owner filed suit in chancery court to prove that it had been deeded access rights to the road and asked to enjoin the retrial until these rights were determined. The chancery court dismissed the suit and imposed sanctions under Miss. R. Civ. P. 11. The eminent domain court awarded compensation based on the permit rights. In consolidated appeals, the court affirmed the chancery court's dismissal order, but reversed the order imposing sanctions when the owner in good faith believed that the chancery court had the sole jurisdiction to try title. Also, the court held that the eminent domain court was allowed to decide questions of title on the basis of pendent jurisdiction. The eminent domain court's decision was reversed and the matter was remanded for a determination of the owner's title claims when adherence to the prior ruling on appeal worked an injustice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Chancery Court of Lamar County (Mississippi) denied appellant county board of education's request for relief in its action to void appellee's leasehold of Sixteenth-Section School Trust Land and confirmed appellee's leasehold. Appellant challenged that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county board of education (board) filed an action seeking to void appellee's leasehold of Sixteenth-Section School Trust Land which had been originally leased by another individual for a fee alleged to be unconscionably and unconstitutionally low. Specifically, 3.5 acres had originally been leased for 99 years at a one-time fee of $ 150, and appellee acquired 2.5 of the 3.5 acres for a one-time fee of $ 45,000. The Board contended specifically that Hudson's leasehold should be declared void because the original conveyance was so low that it constituted a donation in violation of Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 95. The court reversed the chancery court's denial of the relief sought by the board. The court held that, as a matter of law, a one-time leasehold fee of a nominal 46 cents per acre per year was inadequate consideration and was essentially an illegal donation of land held in the public trust. Mere compliance with statutory formalities and procedures did not vitiate substantive violation of constitutional prohibitions. Pursuant to state constitutional dictates, the common law of trusts, and prior decisions of the court, the leasehold was declared void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared appellee's lease void, reversed and remanded to appellant county board of education for the initiation of an appraisal procedure, and reversed the decision of the chancery court.

The circuit court also found that the aforementioned expenditure of time was reasonable and obvious from the record based on the quality and extent of defense counsel's efforts on defendant's behalf.

After finding that no errors in the guilt phase required reversal, the court held that the trial judge abused his discretion by restricting defendant's closing argument during the sentencing phase to 15 minutes instead of allowing the additional time requested. The court was unable to conclude that defendant's right to be heard was not impaired. By offering to read to the trial court portions of his closing argument that he never had time to say, defendant clearly demonstrated that he was prejudiced by not being allowed to make a full and complete closing argument. The court ruled that the two instructions, that the capital murder was committed for pecuniary gain and that the capital murder was committed while in the commission of a robbery, were improperly given as separate and distinct aggravating circumstances. When life was at stake, a jury was not to be allowed the opportunity to doubly weigh the commission of the underlying felony and the motive behind the underlying felony as separate aggravators. The decision was to be prospective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the sentencing phase, defense counsel requested an instruction that defendant was a habitual offender and would not be eligible for parole, but withdrew the instruction prior to argument. There was no ruling on that instruction by the lower court. During oral argument, counsel for the defense attempted to argue the fact of no parole to the jury, if it returned a verdict imposing life imprisonment. Defendant's status as a habitual offender was uncertain during the sentencing phase. The habitual offender hearing was held after the jury retired to consider its verdict. No ruling was rendered on the habitual offender status by the lower court until after the jury returned with its sentence of death. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to inform the jury that he was ineligible for parole. The court held that the identical issue had been recently decided against the state in two other cases. Therefore, the sentence and judgment imposing the death penalty were reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the evidence did not support a finding that her parental rights should have been terminated and that &sect; 93-15-103 was unconstitutionally vague and violated her equal protection rights. The court affirmed the judgment, finding ample evidence that the relationship between the mother and the minor children was practically non-existent. The court explained that the consequence of the mother's incarceration for murder and armed robbery was tantamount to an abandonment. The court noted that &sect; 93-15-103 permitted a court to consider a parent's long term imprisonment in reaching a decision regarding the termination of that parent's parental rights. The court found that &sect; 93-15-103(3) was not vague, explaining that a rule was not objectionable merely because it was stated in general terms and was not susceptible of precise application. The court found that &sect; 93-15-103 was racial neutral on its face and, as such, that the mother had the burden of showing that there was a racially discriminatory intent or purpose behind the statute in order to show a violation of the right of equal protection. The court stated that the mother failed to meet that burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was a victim of sexual abuse. She placed her children in the care of the children's home because she did not have the financial means to provide for them. Later, adults began to report that the children were engaging in sexualized play and showing other signs of sexual abuse. When the children were questioned, they reported that the mother and others had engaged in various sexual acts with them on numerous occasions. The mother denied that the children were ever sexually abused while in her care. An expert witness testified that it was his opinion that the children had been the victims of sexual abuse and that it would be in the best interests of the children for them to be separated in order to prevent future sexual activity between them. The mother claimed that the judgment terminating her rights and separating the children was improper. The court held that (1) the findings that the children were sexually abused and that the mother was a participant were supported by the record; and (2) the evidence of sexual abuse was sufficient for termination of the mother's parental rights under Miss.

The County Chancery Court, Second Judicial District (Mississippi) held that the corporation had no right under the oil and gas lease to explore, over 25 years later, for oil and gas. The corporation appealed and defendant state and superintendent cross appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After compliance with Miss.

In response to the corporation's action to quiet title, the superintendent and the state argued that the lease, under the provisions of &sect; 211 of the Mississippi Constitution, expired. Moreover, defendants asked for an accounting. The chancery court held that the corporation could not have retained indefinitely all undeveloped areas of the lease and thereby cancelled the oil, gas, and mineral lease as to all non-producing areas and horizons. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 211 limited sixteenth section land leases (including mineral leases) to a maximum term of 25- years. However, the court held that the chancery court's decision to favor economic realties and not award an accounting was an error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorneys filed a motion with the trial court for compensation of $ 60.00 an hour for representing an indigent.

The attorneys challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 99-15-17.

The court held that: (1) although &sect; 99-15-17 limited the compensation that an attorney could receive for representing an indigent, it allowed for reimbursement of actual expenses; (2) if a statute could be interpreted as constitutional or unconstitutional, the court adopts the constitutional construction; and (3) the court was able to save the statute from unconstitutionality by interpreting the language to include reimbursement for all actual costs to the lawyer for the purpose of keeping his door open to handle the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted in separate instruments for the capital murder of two victims whose charred bodies were found in the trunk of a car. At the time of trial in the case, defendant had not yet been tried for the murder of the second victim. On appeal, he argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred when it overruled his motion in limine to exclude evidence and argument that pertained to the second murder. The trial court's ruling was based upon the fact that the events of the common scheme or plan were so intertwined that they could properly be submitted to the jury pursuant to Miss. R. Evid. 404(b). The court agreed and found that presentation of evidence regarding the second murder was substantially necessary to present &quot;the complete story of the crime.&quot; With regard to sentencing, the court held that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's request to instruct the jury regarding the effect of the habitual offender indictment. According to the court, the jury should have been informed that defendant's prior convictions would enhance his punishment and that he was ineligible for parole pursuant to Miss.

Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-51 (Supp. 1990), which legalized bingo, was unconstitutional under Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 98, which prohibited lotteries. The trial court granted summary judgment to the attorney general and permanently enjoined the bingo operators from further bingo activity. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that, under the plain language of Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 98, bingo was not a lottery because it did not involve the selling of tickets. In so holding, the court refused to follow the precedents of many sister states, noting that it would not in clear conscience blindly concur in the conclusion that bingo was a lottery simply because other courts had so concluded. After declaring that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-51 (Supp. 1990) was constitutional, the court warned that strict guidelines and enforcement measures via legislation were needed to avert further personal profiteering and circumvention of the statute's purpose, which was to benefit nonprofit civic, educational, wildlife conservation, or religious organizations.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that defendant's confession was admissible even though there was a dispute as to whether he requested counsel prior to giving the confession. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for change of venue as a result of pretrial publicity. Defendant's claim of error relating to his challenge for cause as to specific jurors was rejected because he failed to exhaust all of his peremptory challenges. In addition, the court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing several photographs of the victim into evidence. Finally, with regard to defendant's guilt, the court ruled that the trial court properly refused to give a lesser included charge on manslaughter because the evidence was clear that defendant acted with malice in beating the victim to death. As to defendant's sentencing, however, the court held that because the trial court determined that defendant was a habitual offender, the jury should have been told that defendant was ineligible for parole before deliberating on defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, corporations and asbestos compensation fund, sought review by interlocutory appeal of an order by the Jackson County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which granted partial summary to plaintiff personal injury claimant on his allegation that a discovery rule existed in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49 (1972) that was applicable in a products liability and negligence action involving latent diseases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff personal injury claimant filed suit against defendants, corporation and asbestos compensation fund, for personal injuries allegedly sustained by plaintiff by exposure to asbestos. Defendants argued that the action was barred by the six-year statute of limitations found in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49 (1972). Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether his action was barred by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49 (1972). Plaintiff sought an adjudication that at the time of the filing of his complaint a discovery rule existed, so that his cause of action did not accrue until he was diagnosed with asbestos-related disease. The trial court granted the motion, and the court affirmed, holding that under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49 (1972), the cause of action accrued and the statute of limitations began to run when plaintiff could have been held to have had knowledge of the injury or disease. A cause of action accrued only when the right to sue became vested. Thus, because plaintiff filed suit one month after the discovery of asbestos-related disease, he was well within the six-year statute of limitations found in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-49 (1972).</SPAN></P>

It provided that unless good cause was shown and a continuance duly granted, all offenses for which indictments were presented to the trial court had to be tried no later than 270 days after the accused had been arraigned. The total number of days that transpired from arraignment to trial, not including the time of continuances, was 418 days. The court concluded that the prosecution missed the statutory deadline for a speedy trial by 148 days. It also found that defendant established all of the elements of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defense counsel's performance was so sub-standard that he was not functioning as counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and by Miss. Const. Art. 3, &sect; 26 (1890). There was a reasonable probability that but for defense counsel's errors and deficient performance, the outcome of the proceedings against defendant could well have been different.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. On remand, the trial court was directed to consider whether there was good cause for the delay. If the State was unable to show good cause for enough of the delay to bring the case under the 270-day limitation, the indictment against defendant had to be dismissed, and he had to be finally discharged.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the action was not barred under &sect; 15-1-49 and found that &sect; 15-1-49(3) (Supp. 1990) was not an attempt to revive a barred claim and was not unconstitutional. On interlocutory appeal, the court held that a discovery rule existed in conjunction with &sect; 15-1-49 in the case of a negligence or products liability cause of action involving latent disease. The court held that the cause of action accrued and the limitations period began to run when the worker could have reasonably have been held to have had knowledge of the injury of the disease, the date of the diagnosis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant allegedly burglarized a home, police obtained items taken in the burglary while searching the residence of defendant's girlfriend.

Even though the search may have violated the girlfriend's Fourth Amendment rights, defendant failed to satisfy his burden of proving that his own constitutional rights were violated by the search. The court also held that the mere legitimate presence in the girlfriend's apartment was insufficient to create the protectable expectation of privacy. Canning v. State, 226 So. 2d 747 (Miss. 1969) and Fuller v. State 230 So. 2d 213 (Miss. 1970) were overruled to the extent they were inconsistent with the decision.

The Pike County Chancery Court (Mississippi) found that, under Miss Code Ann. &sect; 1-331 or &sect; 51-1-3, a portion of river was not a navigable waterway and, under Miss.

The trial court held that the landowners had riparian rights in the river because it was navigable in the section that was the subject of the parties' dispute. The court held that pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 51-9-103, the river was navigable and public water for recreational use because the river was the principal tributary of another navigable river, the average depth was greater than three feet, and the average water flow exceeded 100 cubic feet per second. The court also held that Miss Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-3-31 and 51-1-1, which established the 200 bales of cotton steamboat test of navigability did not apply because the river was declared public by 3 U.S. Stat. &sect;&sect; 348, 349 before the statute was enacted, and the state did not have the power to make the public waterway private.</SPAN></P>

Defendant stopped paying support when his wife remarried, and the wife was unable to work because of the needs of the child.

The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction where defendant was financially able to pay while the child was destitute, there was no credible evidence that defendant attempted to pay support, and the former wife had attempted to collect support. There was no undue prejudice for the jury to see the child in the hallway at the conclusion of the trial because the State made no effort to make a prominent display of the child. Section 97-5-3 was not unconstitutional because it was not imprisonment for debt and the State had a legitimate interest in prosecution a financially able parent who willfully deserted or failed to support his child when the child was in destitute circumstances.

The Newton County Circuit Court (Mississippi) denied the commission's motion for summary judgment and granted respondent's motion to dismiss, finding the seizure provisions of Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A large quantity of intoxicating liquor was found in the trunk of respondent's vehicle, which was being driven in a dry county. The court narrowed its decision to the question of the reasonableness of the state's seizure of the automobile under the Fourth Amendment. The court noted that if the seizure had been based on the use of the vehicle to possess with the intention to resell or deliver for resale and the facts had substantiated that claim, the seizure would have been reasonable and constitutionally sustained. The court was of the opinion that the constitutionality of the statute was not properly before the lower court and that the court erred in declaring the statute unconstitutional of its own volition. The importance and significance of the decision were enormous. Were the seizure ruled unreasonable, alcoholic beverages could be purchased wherever they were legal and carried into dry areas for consumption, even where a majority of the people had voted to maintain such areas dry. The court would not thwart the will and rights of the people by destroying their freedom of choice. It was also error to return the vehicle to respondent pending a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A ten-year old female child reported that defendant tricked her into coming to his house and then he dragged her into the house and raped her. After the rape, she immediately ran to a nearby relative's house and reported the rape. She then identified defendant from a photo array that a police officer had put together. During the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor led the victim to a holding room, where she identified defendant. That identification was ruled inadmissible, but the victim was permitted to make an in-court identification at the trial. Defendant presented an alibi defense and claimed that the photo array and the identification at the preliminary hearing were impermissibly suggestive and made the in-court identification improper, but he was convicted. The court, holding that reliability was the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony, found that the victim had a detailed and prolonged view of defendant in daylight when he raped her, and the totality of the circumstances made her in-court identification admissible. The court also ruled that there was clearly sufficient credible evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty of rape.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer appealed a judgment entered in the Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi) which, after a jury trial, determined that defendant was liable to plaintiff for allegedly unauthorized misrepresentations by agents of defendant in an action where plaintiff sought punitive and compensatory damages when defendant refused to honor plaintiff's insurance policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer offered life insurance policies through agents at plaintiff's place of employment. Defendant refused to insure plaintiff after plaintiff made a claim on the policy. Defendant alleged that plaintiff was refused insurance because plaintiff had health conditions and alleged that the agents made unauthorized misrepresentations. Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages under the policy. The court reviewed the conditions under which the policy was made. The jury could have found that the formation of the insurance contract was sufficient to hold defendant liable. The actions of defendant's agents bound defendant. The court held that, based on defendant's actions, the issue of punitive damages was properly submitted to the jury. The court affirmed the jury verdict and awarded plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The youth court prosecutor filed a petition alleging that the child was battered based on a report made by an emergency room nurse, who had concluded that the child's injuries were not consistent with the father's explanation of a fall. The court found that the father as a natural parent had standing to appeal the adjudication affecting his custodial rights and that a prior ruling was not res judicata because it was not a final judgment. The court affirmed and held that the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-107 (1989), was a constitutionally valid vesting of original jurisdiction to the youth courts in all proceedings concerning an abused child. Although the petition was not filed within 10 days after its filing was authorized as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-451 (1972), a balancing of the considerations revealed that the youth court's failure to dismiss the petition was not an abuse of its discretion. The court ordered that the father be refunded any court reporter's fees that he had deposited or paid in excess of the fees allowable under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 9-13-33 (1989).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his forcible rape conviction. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. In so doing, it first rejected defendant's contentions that the evidence against him was legally insufficient.

That testimony was inadmissible both because the physician was not qualified as an expert on the subject and because the point itself went to the ultimate issue. In addition, the physician should not have been permitted to testify that the complainant seemed truthful in her claims that she had been raped, and defendant should have been permitted to introduce evidence of the complainant's sexual activity after the alleged rape in order to demonstrate that her hymeneal ring had been lost via that sexual activity rather than via rape.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered judgment against the debtors, and they appealed. The court held that the circuit judge's decision concerning liability disregarded applicable and established constitutional law. The court stated that an evidentiary hearing should have been held, and the creditor's claim of good-faith reliance on a presumptively-valid statute should have been considered in light of not only the sincerity in its belief that it was acting properly, but the reasonableness of its actions under the circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to a seven-year term of imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to armed robbery with a deadly weapon. The sentence was to run consecutively with the life sentence that defendant was serving in Canada, which life sentence was later commuted. The circuit court set aside the sentence on the ground that it was an unconstitutional application of an ex post facto law insofar as it was mandatory. Defendant declined to withdraw his plea, the circuit court sentenced him to a 20-year term. On appeal, the court held that the original sentence was lawful because there was nothing in the sentencing order that dictated that the sentence was without parole. Moreover, the original sentence was within the range provided in &sect; 97-3-79. Accordingly, the court further held that the circuit court lacked authority to resentence defendant. Furthermore, the original sentence in conjunction with the controlling parole statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3(1)(d) (1972), as amended, was not an illegal application of an ex post facto law. Defendant was not &quot;sentenced&quot; under &sect; 47-7-3, and his parole rights were not restricted by &sect; 47-7-3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessee challenged a decision from the Chancery Court of the Second Judicial District of Jones County (Mississippi), which cancelled and set aside its oil and gas lease with defendants, state and lessor, as to all non-producing areas in the lessee's action to confirm and quiet its lease interests. The state and the lessor challenged the trial court's decision to allow the lessee to continue operations at the producing reservoir.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1957 the lessor executed an oil and gas lease that was later assigned to the lessee. The lease had a primary term of six years and so long thereafter as oil and gas were produced. Miss. Const. &sect; 211 (1944), however, prohibited leases longer than 25 years. The lessee filed an action to confirm and quiet the lease interest. The state and the lessor filed a counterclaim and argued that the lease expired in 1982 pursuant to &sect; 211. The trial court held that the lease remained in full force and effect as to the lessee's producing reservoir but cancelled the lease as to all non-producing areas. The lessee appealed the cancellation of the lease as to the non-producing areas, and the state and the lessor appealed the lease extension. The court affirmed. The court held that the lessee had the lawful right pursuant to &sect; 211 and Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 6600 (1942) to continue its production under the lease from the proven reservoir if it continued to comply with the lease terms. The court held that 25 years was the maximum period that Miss. Const. &sect; 211 (1944) authorized the lessee to possess the surface; thus, the lessee was not permitted to continue exploration in non-producing areas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling in favor of the state and the lessor in the lessee's action to confirm and quiet interests in its oil and gas lease and affirmed on the cross-appeal. The court reversed and remanded for the limited purpose of permitting the chancellor to properly frame a decree permitting the lessee's use of the surface so long as oil and gas were commercially produced from the area that was currently in production.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the paternal grandparents' son who was the father of the grandchild was killed, the maternal grandparents received consent of their daughter to adopt their grandchild. The daughter was 16 and the mother of the grandchild. The consent was given on the same date the petition for adoption was filed. The paternal grandparents were not made parties to the adoption petition or proceeding. They filed a petition to set aside the adoption and grant them visitation rights because they had not been named parties. The paternal grandparents sought to assert a right of visitation under 1983 Miss. Laws 497, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;93-16-3. That Act however provided for visitation rights when there had been a termination of parental rights under the 1968 Act, not the general adoption statutes. The paternal grandparents were excluded because neither of the &quot;legal&quot; adoptive parents was a natural parent of the child. Therefore, there was no statutory right of visitation in the paternal grandparents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with DUI. The City sought a pretrial ruling in a municipal court concerning the admissibility of defendant's three prior DUI convictions and one conviction for driving while his license was suspended. The municipal court ruled that the exhibits were inadmissible because the City could not show that defendant had been represented by counsel or had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel for the prior convictions. On appeal, the circuit court reversed. On further review, the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court held that the prior convictions of defendant when he was without counsel were constitutionally valid in and of themselves and valid for the purpose of enhancing punishment under &sect; 63-11-30. The prior convictions could also be considered for any lesser administrative sanctions, such as suspension of one's driver's license. The court also found that defendant's convictions that had no reference to counsel had a presumption of regularity. Defendant could present evidence to rebut such presumption, shifting the burden to the City to prove that defendant's rights were protected during the course of the convictions.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the court held that a challenge via the Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-1 et seq. (Supp. 1989) was not open to defendant because the Act did not give defendant a right to institute an independent, original action for a free transcript or other documents, and then if dissatisfied with the trial court's ruling, to directly appeal that ruling to this court as a separate and independent action. Thus, the court held that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Addressing the merits of the appeal in dicta, the court also noted that the trial court correctly denied the motion for transcripts. The court held that, by pleading guilty and bypassing the opportunity for direct appeal, he forfeited his right to a free transcript.</SPAN></P>

The construction company contended that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment because it was unconstitutional to allow wrongful death plaintiffs a better statute of limitations than personal injury plaintiffs. It further argued that the administratrix's cause of action had expired, and the amendment to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 15-1-41 could not revive the administratrix's cause of action. It also asserted that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the action with prejudice due to the administratrix's failure to timely answer interrogatories. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the construction company's motion for summary judgment finding that &sect; 15-1-41 was not unconstitutional and that the administratrix's cause of action was not barred by the amendment to &sect; 15-1-41.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee purchased a leasehold interest in property which was covered by a 99-year lease, the consideration for which had been a single payment of $ 7.50.

The board counterclaimed for cancellation of the lease, and contended that the lease was invalid because the consideration was so inadequate as to make the lease a donation of property, in violation of Miss. Const. art 4, &sect; 95. The trial court found in favor of the lessee and assessed a $ 7,500 sanction against the board for filing a frivolous defense. The court determined that when Mississippi became a state, a section of each township was reserved in the name of the state for the support of schools, and the management of the school lands was delegated to the local school board. The court determined that the lands were held in trust for the benefit of local schools, and that no trustee had the right to lease trust lands for less than fair market value. The court held that the consideration was so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscious. The court remanded the case to the trial court to determine the true value of the land.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor pled guilty in a federal court to operating an illegal gambling business in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1955. In a separate action, he was convicted of violating state laws pertaining to illegal sales of liquor. The Commission charged the mayor with judicial misconduct, in violation of Miss. Const. art. VI, &sect; 177A (1890), as amended, and recommended a suspension from the bench. The mayor denied that he was a judge, that the Commission had jurisdiction over him pursuant to Miss. Const. art VI, &sect; 177A (1890), and that he was guilty of judicial misconduct. In adopting in part the Commission's recommendation, the court ruled that the mayor was a municipal judge pro tempore, by virtue of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-23-5, and that the Code of Judicial Conduct required compliance with the Code by anyone, whether or not a lawyer, who was an officer of a judicial system performing judicial functions. A judge pro tempore was defined as a person who is appointed to act temporarily as a judge. Thus, the mayor was subject to sanction as a judge by the Commission. The mayor's misconduct, though not official, brought his judicial office into disrepute, and warranted his removal from the bench.</SPAN></P>

The insurance companies sought an adjudication that the funds were not subject to the reporting and payment provisions of the Act. The trial court entered judgment for the insurance companies and permanently enjoined the state treasurer from enforcing the Act with regard to these particular funds. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Section 16 of the Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 89-12-35 (1972) was to be given a prospective application because retroactive application to lift the bar of the limitations period would have destroyed the insurance companies' vested rights and would have been a violation of Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 97, precluding the revival of time-barred remedies. The state treasurer's right to the abandoned funds was derivative from the rights of the owners and payees of said funds. Thus, the insurance companies' reliance on vested rights arising from the running of the limitations period against those owners and payees did not constitute a prohibited direct assertion of the statute of limitations against the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney sought review of a decision of the Lauderdale Circuit Court (Mississippi), which affirmed a judgment of a county court that convicted the attorney for breach of the peace and fined him $ 250.00. The attorney challenged the constitutionality of the breach of peace statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-35-13 (1972).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was arrested by a police officer for breach of the peace in a public place after the police officer had attempted to serve a warrant on the attorney's client in the lobby of the county's juvenile center. The attorney asserted that &sect; 97-35-13 was unconstitutionally broad and vague because it regulated constitutionally-protected First Amendment rights, including the right to make an extemporaneous, on-the-scene protest to a policeman's demeanor, conduct, and authority. He also contended that the statute was not tied to an expressed interest of the state nor was its application limited to the extent necessary to serve such an interest. The court rejected the attorney's arguments and held that the statute was constitutional, both facially and as applied. The court specifically found that the statute was not so vague or overbroad that individuals, particularly attorneys, of common intelligence had to guess at its meaning. The attorney's disorderly conduct in a public place was conduct which the state had a compelling interest in proscribing. Also, there was no evidence that the appellate court's enhancement of the fine imposed was a result of judicial vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant non-profit corporation sued appellee city, seeking a temporary retraining order and a declaration that a city ordinance, which restricted the operation of a carnival or fair to one day of operation, was unconstitutional. The Chancery Court, Forrest County (Mississippi), entered a temporary retraining order. It later entered judgment denying relief to the corporation and declaring the ordinance valid. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation owned 28 acres of land in the city. For many years, it operated an annual fair on the land, which was zoned for commercial use. The fair usually lasted seven to 10 days. The corporation argued that the ordinance effectively prohibited the operation of its fair because it was impractical for the fair to be set up and taken down after only one day. No other business was affected by the ordinance. The city asserted that it passed the ordinance after determining that fairs lasting more than a day were detrimental to the public welfare. It claimed that the fair caused increased traffic and other problems. On appeal, the court held that because the fair was a form of entertainment, it was protected under the First Amendment. The city failed to sustain its burden of showing that its interests in minimizing the effect of fairs could not be met in a less intrusive manner than effectively banning the fair. Moreover, the ordinance was not a lawful exercise of the city's police power because it was not rationally related to its stated interest in promoting public welfare. Though other businesses caused similar problems as the fair, the city had not seen fit to regulate them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the chancery court's judgment and rendered a judgment that the ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the rape of the victim, an 11 year-old girl. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction because the hearsay testimony regarding statements made by the victim was improperly admitted by the circuit court. The court held that the victim's statements to a child behavior expert were not generically medical and thus, were outside the hearsay exception for statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment. The court further held that the victim's statements to her teacher six weeks after the incident did not qualify for the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. There being no recognized exception to the hearsay rule for victims of a tender age, the circuit court erroneously allowed the victim's statement and failed to address the question of whether the statements made by the victim would qualify under the residual exceptions to hearsay. Thus, the court remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

He urged that the testimony of the babysitter and the child's mother concerning what the child said about the incident was inadmissible hearsay. The State countered that the evidence fell under the tender years exception to the rule against hearsay in case law. The court ruled that Mississippi's rules of evidence abrogated evidentiary rules set out in caselaw and that the issue had to be decided under the rules of evidence. The testimony did not meet the requirements of Miss. R. Evid. 803(2) because the child did not report the incident while still under the stress of the startling event. The court ruled that the trial court had to determine whether the hearsay statements were admissible under the catchall provisions of Miss. R. Evid. 803(24). The testimony of the babysitter that the child had told her of other occasions defendant had exposed himself to children was improperly admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot an alleged victim in the leg. The indictment charged defendant with committing an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, namely a gun, by knowingly shooting the victim with the intent to cause serious bodily harm. On appeal, defendant argued that he should have been permitted to adduce testimony as to previous specific acts of violence of the victim. In the absence of defendant's justifiable apprehension of his own safety by the victim's conduct, the court held that the victim's character or reputation for violence was irrelevant. Such testimony was not competent unless there was some evidence that the victim had been the aggressor in the affray. Moreover, Rule 405(b) of the Mississippi Rules of Evidence did not allow defendant to show the victim's previous difficulty with third persons unless defendant either saw it or knew of it. Next, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-7(2)(b) only required the State to prove that defendant attempted to cause bodily injury &quot;with a deadly weapon.&quot; The indictment's reference to &quot;serious bodily harm&quot; was surplusage.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of sexual battery against a child under the age of 12 years. On appeal, defendant argued that blood test results should not have been admitted, evidence of a sexually transmitted disease should not have been admitted, and that the state had failed to prove the date of the crime. The court rejected the arguments and affirmed the conviction. First, the court held that blood tests taken of defendant revealing that defendant had gonorrhea were properly admitted because they were taken pursuant to a valid warrant. In any case, the court noted that defendant did not object to the tests and therefore the search was consensual. Second, the court held that evidence that defendant and the minor victim had gonorrhea was properly admitted because such evidence was relevant and corroborated the victim's testimony. Third, the court held that there was no error from the fact that the indictment indicated that the crime occurred on or about January 17, 1986, when in fact the crime occurred on January 21, 1986. The court held that the date on the indictment was specific enough to put defendant on notice of the charge against him.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon being shown a photo array, a jewelry store employee identified defendant as one of two men who robbed the store. Defendant's companion drew a gun and forced the employee to lie on the floor during the robbery. On appeal, defendant contended that he had ineffective counsel, that the sentence violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. The court rejected defendant's contentions, holding that the conduct of defendant's trial counsel fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Next, defendant's claim that his sentence was unconstitutional was procedurally barred because he did not present such argument to the circuit court. Finally, the evidence overwhelmingly was against defendant, reflecting that he was an active participant in the robbery; that he was positively identified as being one of the robbers; that the stolen items, or many of them, were recovered; and that the guilt issue was fairly resolved against him by the jury.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the district attorney used a victim advocacy strategy prohibited by the court, and challenged the prosecutor's statements and a physician's testimony as to the victim's injuries. The state argued that defendant failed to make a proper objection as to the statements and thus the issue was procedurally barred. The court held that it had a statutory obligation to review death penalty cases to determine whether the sentence was imposed under the influence of arbitrary or extraneous influences. The court held that the jury's consideration of an improper aggravating factor was harmless error. Defendant also asserted that his confession was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The court held that the evidence failed to support defendant's contention that he had not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights, and that his challenge as to the admissibility of the confession was not well taken.</SPAN></P>

The witness testified that defendant shot the pizza deliveryman with a sawed-off shotgun. Defendant was convicted and the trial court found two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State Highway Commission challenged a judgment from the Chancery Court of Union County (Mississippi), which, on cross-motions for summary judgment, held that the Commission was estopped by laches from requiring removal of a gas line unless it incurred three-fourths of the cost to appellee city. Suit was first filed in the Chancery Court of Benton County seeking an injunction requiring removal and was transferred on the city's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Where the gas pipeline crossed over a railroad line, the pipe was attached to the exterior of a bridge and was totally unprotected. The Commission determined that the pipeline had to be removed pursuant to Standard Operating Procedure No. MND-04-05-00-000, which prohibited attaching utility pipelines to state highway bridges except to carry water. The court found that the statute of limitations concerning adverse possession, &sect; 29-3-7 of Miss. Code Ann. (1972), did not apply against the State and, therefore, the Commission. The matter was governed by Article 4, &sect; 104 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890. The permit or grant was revocable and could be terminated by the Commission for just cause under &sect; 65-1-8 of Miss. Code Ann. (1988 Supp.). The chancellor found that if the Commission wanted the pipeline removed, it had to bear three-fourths of the cost. This contradicted the law requiring the owner, the city, to bear the cost of removal. The Commission's actions were supported by substantial evidence. The Commission did not act arbitrarily. The Commission acted properly when it requested that the pipeline be removed from the bridge, citing hazards to motorists.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the chancellor's opinion which assessed three-fourths of the costs of the pipeline removal against the Commission. The court affirmed that part of the chancellor's opinion holding that the Commission had a right to request the removal of the pipeline. The court's judgment gave the city a reasonable length of time to implement the court's holding.</SPAN></P>

A jury verdict held defendant guilty of sexual battery of a minor child, a violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 (Supp. 1986), touching and handling a minor child, a violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-5-23 (Supp. 1986), and counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-23-25 (Supp. 1986).</SPAN></P>

Defendant hosted parties for the victims that provided them with alcoholic drinks, marijuana, and drugs before they performed sexual acts with him. The court affirmed the contested judgment because defendant's assignment of errors lacked merit. The trial court correctly overruled defendant's demurrer to the State's multiple count indictment filed under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-7-2 (Supp. 1986). The court found that defendant's conduct toward the victims was part of the same occurrence or scheme. The court found that defendant's methods of seduction were part of a sexual battery. The court decided that, under Miss. R. Evid. 404(b), those methods were relevant to the charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The trial court correctly allowed a trial on all counts because the indictments arose from the same transactions and the evidence was admissible for each of the charges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legitimate heirs of the decedent executed leased conveying to the first oil companies rights to oil, gas, and minerals. The first oil company then assigned an overriding royalty to the second oil company. The common law wife of one of the illegitimate heirs joined with the other illegitimate heirs and filed an action to establish their right to inherit under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15 (Supp.1988). The oil companies filed motions for summary judgment, which the chancery court granted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the rights of the oil companies were contract rights protected by U.S. Const. art. I, cl. 1 and Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 16 (1890). The court reasoned that any rights the illegitimate heirs might have enjoyed under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15 (Supp.1988) vested after the date when contract rights vested in the oil companies and were wholly subject to those rights. The court concluded that the oil companies were bona fide purchasers for value and because the land records nor accessible law gave them no notice of the illegitimate heirs' claims, they acquired title against the world.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the capital murder of a victim and for the rape of a second victim. The trial judge in the rape case continued the trial pending the outcome of the murder trial. When defendant's murder conviction was overturned on appeal, the State proceeded on the rape charge. Defendant argued that he was denied his right to a speedy trial, but the court affirmed his conviction. The court examined four factors for purposes of assessing defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial. The 790 day delay in bringing defendant to trial was lengthy. However, the reason for the delay, to try defendant on a capital crime, was legitimate. The court assigned little weight to defendant's failure to assert his right to a speedy trial because there was some question as to whether defendant was aware of the continuance. Finally, the court found that the absence of prejudice to defendant weighed heavily in favor of the State. The delay did not violate the speedy trial statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-17-1 (Supp. 1987), because the written order of continuance was the equivalent of a judicial determination that good cause existed for granting the continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county taxpayers challenged the judgment of the Chancery Court of Hinds County (Mississippi), which, in an action brought against appellee state tax commission, held that a legislative enactment granting tax exempt status to a county nuclear power plant did not violate Miss. Const., art. 4, &sect; 112. The taxpayers also argued that they were improperly denied leave to amend their complaint to include federal constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county taxpayers objected when the state legislature passed a bill that granted tax exempt status to a nuclear power plant within their county. Because it was the only nuclear plant within the state that meet the statute's criteria, and thus they were the only county affected by the statute, the taxpayers argued that the law violated Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 122. The court agreed that the statute violated the &quot;old&quot; &sect; 112, but the question was whether earlier amendments to the state constitution did in fact legally change the constitution and thus made the statute valid. The court held that the amendments were valid, that they did apply retroactively, and that the statute was a constitutional &quot;general&quot; law, rather than a &quot;special&quot; law, even though it applied to only the one power plant. However, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion in not permitting the taxpayers to amend their complaint to include 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Equal Protection claims. Although the motion for leave to amend was filed late in the case, refusal of the federal courts to hear the claim meant that the state court was the only forum open to the taxpayers to resolve the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the statute granting tax exempt status to a county nuclear power plant was valid under the recently amended state constitution but that the trial court abused its discretion in not permitting appellant county taxpayers to amend their complaint to included &sect; 1983 and Equal Protection claims in their action against appellee state tax commission.</SPAN></P>

So much of the judgment as ordered that defendant be put to death was reversed and rendered and the case was remanded for a hearing on the charge laid in the indictment that defendant was a habitual offender. Having failed to satisfy an element of proof, the state was not permitted a second bite at the apple. Due process rights secured to defendant by Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant County Board of Supervisors (board) sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court, Calhoun County (Mississippi) that granted appellee taxpayer's motion notwithstanding the verdict concerning the net value of the intangible assets of the taxpayer's two bank branches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer reported to the county tax assessor that the net value of the intangible assets of its two bank branches was $ 23,991. The tax assessor computed the value as $ 522,561. The taxpayer was charged taxes of $ 50,729.22. The board overruled an objection by the taxpayer and the taxpayer appealed. A jury found the valuation to be fair and reasonable. Upon the taxpayer's motion, the trial court entered judgment for the taxpayer notwithstanding the verdict, reasoning that the valuation and assessment were unconstitutional under Miss. Const. &sect; 112. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded in part. The court held that the trial court reached the right result in assessing the intangibles according to the State Tax Commission formula. However, the court held that in view of the overriding constitutional consideration of equality and uniformity in the application of tax laws, and in view of its duty to construe statutes in accordance with the perceived intent of the legislature, the court, prospectively, required use of the adapted multi-state corporation formula for valuation of branch banks until the legislature determined otherwise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that the valuation and assessment were unconstitutional under Miss. Const. &sect; 112. The court reversed the trial court in holding that the entire balance of the taxpayer's bad debt reserves was deductible. The court remanded for determination of the amount, if any, disbursed from the taxpayer's bad debt reserves to cover actual bad debts realized during the taxable year and for re-computation of the tax liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, illegitimate children of the original owner of two tracts of real property, challenged the decision of the Chancery Court, Jasper County (Mississippi), which entered a summary judgment in favor of appellees, established heirs of the original owner of real property and others who took title through them, in an action to determine heirship and redivide assets.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the action brought by the illegitimate children, the established heirs and others who took title through them answered and counterclaimed in which they sought cloud removal and quieting of title. The trial court sustained the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment of the established heirs and others who took title through them and denied the motion for partial summary judgment of the illegitimate children of the original owner. An appeal was taken. The court held that it was premature for the trial court to have ruled that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15 was unconstitutional when it was unclear whether the illegitimate children could actually recover. Inasmuch as the court found the trial court's ruling that the statute was unconstitutional, the contingent findings as to res judicata and statute of limitations were also premature. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in failing to grant the illegitimate children partial summary judgment because, in a prior action, the issue decided was whether the father of the illegitimate children had a common law marriage with their mother. The issue of paternity for the illegitimate children was not decided.</SPAN></P>
