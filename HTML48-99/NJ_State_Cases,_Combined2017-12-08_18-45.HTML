</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-2(a), sexual assault, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-2(b), and endangering the welfare of a child, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:24-4(a), and sentenced to concurrent sentences. The appellate court affirmed the convictions but determined that the conviction for endangering the welfare should have been merged with the other convictions. The appellate court adopted an exception to the hearsay rule that authorized admissibility of a child's out-of-court statements concerning sexual abuse if made to a parent, confidant, physician, or other professional under circumstances that afforded sufficient indicia of reliability to justify admission. The court held that such a fundamental change in the hearsay rule solely by judicial decision was inconsistent with the procedure requiring collaboration among all three branches of government set forth in the Evidence Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:84A-33 to -45. The court held that the adoption of such a rule was plain error because it was capable of producing an unjust result. The court reversed a judgment of the appellate court and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant surrogate mother challenged the order of the Superior Court (New Jersey) that enforced the terms of a surrogate parent contract on behalf of plaintiff father. Defendant claimed that the surrogacy contract was invalid; that the trial court improperly terminated her parental rights and awarded sole custody to plaintiff father, and improperly allowed the adoption of the child by plaintiff's wife, all pursuant to the terms of the contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On direct certification from the trial court, the court reversed the order that terminated defendant surrogate mother's parental rights, restored her as the mother of the child, and invalidated the surrogacy contract entered into between plaintiff father and defendant. The court ruled that the contract was invalid as a matter of law, because it violated statute and was against public policy. The court found that private placement adoption was disfavored, that the payment of money made the contract illegal and possibly criminal under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:3-54, and that it was vested with an element of coercion. The court ruled that the agreement was totally unenforceable. The court determined that the statute required a surrender of the child to a public agency and then a termination proceeding, which could only proceed after counseling. The court held that the termination of defendant's parental rights called for by the surrogacy contract and ordered by the trial court, failed to comply with statutory requirements. The court ruled that no one can contractually abandon one's parental rights. The court held that because the termination was invalid, the adoption was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court invalidated the surrogacy contract because it conflicted with the law and public policy of the state. The court granted custody to plaintiff father, voided both the termination of the surrogate mother's parental rights and the adoption of the child by plaintiff's wife, and restored defendant surrogate mother as the mother of the child. The court remanded the case on the issue of visitation only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant police officer challenged a judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), reversing a judgment not withstanding the verdict in favor of respondent individual in an action claiming appellant violated respondent's civil rights brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant police officer investigated a potential child abuse claim. An assistant county prosecutor advised appellant that probable cause existed to arrest respondent individual. Respondent filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, claiming the arrest was without probable cause and violated his constitutional rights. The trial court entered a judgment for appellant notwithstanding the verdict and the appellate court reversed. The court held that an officer was entitled to judgment as a matter of law when she could reasonably have believed in the existence of probable cause. Because appellant was confronted with a possible case of child abuse and acted on the advice of counsel, the court concluded as a matter of law that a reasonable police officer could have believed that she had probable cause to arrest. Because the law did not require an officer, who reasonably believed she had probable cause to exercise due diligence before an arrest, the court held that respondent failed to defeat appellant's assertion of qualified immunity. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and reinstated the judgment dismissing the complaint notwithstanding the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers sought refund of taxes paid under the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 58:10-23.11 to 58:10-23.24, and challenged the findings and recommendations of the Tax Court (New Jersey). Plaintiff urged that the Act's provisions not pre-empted by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9601-9675, were not severable from the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers claimed that non-offending portions of the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act), N.J. Stat.

The court held that the purposes of the Spill Act held to be pre-empted could be severed from the remainder of the statute without impairing its validity. The court ruled that the Spill Act made sense with or without the pre-empted purposes. The court determined that the period of preemption ended on the effective date of the statute that repealed the preemption language of CERCLA. The court remanded the case for the lower court to determine what portion of the tax revenues were generated by severed portions of the Spill Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the order of the Superior Court (New Jersey), which affirmed his conviction for murder. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred when it refused to charge the jury that evidence of diminished capacity resulting from a mental disease or defect was relevant to the question of whether defendant's admitted killing of another was knowing or purposeful. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, defendant offered psychiatric testimony that he suffered from a disease or defect that rendered him unable to formulate the requisite mental state for murder. The court reversed the judgment and held that diminished capacity was evidence which denied the existence of facts which the state had to prove to establish the essential elements of first degree murder, that the allocation of responsibility between judge and jury required that competent reliable evidence be submitted to the jury and that a diminished capacity charge be given to the jury when competent reliable evidence had been offered. The court ruled that the defense of diminished capacity was not an affirmative defense that justified or excused conduct otherwise criminal, but rather allowed the introduction of evidence relevant to the question of whether the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite criminal mental state. The court held that it was constitutionally permissible to require defendant to establish the presence of such mental disease or defect so long as the state retained the burden of proving the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that defendant was entitled to have the jury charged that relevant evidence of mental disease or defect could be considered either with respect to an insanity defense or as negating the state of mind required for murder. The judgment of the appellate court was reversed as to the murder conviction, affirmed as to companion convictions, and the matter remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff construction corporation and defendant Department of Transportation executed public contract for highway work. Poor working conditions caused numerous delays, and plaintiff initiated action to recover damages. The trial court held that defendant was liable for material misrepresentations of the working conditions which caused the delays and that such misrepresentations were not covered by the exculpatory or no-damage-for-delay clauses. The appellate court affirmed in all respects except that it upheld the exculpatory clause as efficacious in the circumstances. The court held that facts were sufficient to support the finding that defendant's nondisclosure of material facts constituted a misrepresentation of conditions for which recovery should have been allowed. Pursuant to the New Jersey Contractual Liability Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:13-1 to -10, when the state made false representations it was liable for damages resulting despite general disclaimer of liability; however, if such disclaimer was sufficiently specific or if it only purported to be test results, a contractor could not recover.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:13-15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant foreign mortgage corporation challenged the appellate court's judgment affirming the trial court's dismissal of appellant's mortgage foreclosure suit because appellant failed to file a Notice of Business Activities Report as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:13-15. It was undisputed that appellant satisfied the conditions that would bar it from maintaining the action under the Corporation Business Activities Reporting Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:13-14 to -23 (act), and that none of the exceptions applied. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:13-20b, the enforcement provision, was unconstitutional. However, the court held that the unconstitutionality of the provision as written did not require invalidation of the entire act. The court concluded that to preserve the constitutionality of &sect; 14A:13-20b, the statute was to be interpreted to mean that a foreign corporation could pursue a cause of action in the state after filing a report and meeting the conditions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:13-20c(2), regardless of whether the report was filed in the same accounting period in which the cause of action arose. The court held that the act did not violate the supremacy clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The New Jersey Attorney General filed a civil complaint against defendants, construction companies, for alleged violations of the New Jersey Antitrust Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 56:9-1 to -19. The trial court granted summary judgment to the Attorney General. The Attorney General asked that civil penalties of $ 2.1 million be imposed, which represented $ 500 for each day the conspiracy continued. The trial court instead imposed lump sum penalties of $ 100,000 or less, the appellate court affirmed, and the Attorney General appealed. The court found that the New Jersey Legislature intended to authorize the courts to impose per diem penalties that in the aggregate could exceed $ 100,000. The court identified several factors the New Jersey courts should consider in setting penalties, including the good or bad faith of defendant, defendant's ability to pay, amount of profits obtained from illegal activity, and injury to the public. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment as to the imposition of penalties and remanded the case to the trial court to determine the penalties.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:15-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of second-degree robbery, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:15-1. Because he met the criteria for an extended term of imprisonment as a persistent offender under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7, defendant was exposed to a term of imprisonment between 10 and 20 years, with a presumptive term of 15 years. The trial court imposed the presumptive sentence of 15 years for a persistent offender convicted of second-degree crime and added a period of seven years of parole ineligibility. The appellate court agreed that defendant was eligible for sentencing as a persistent offender, but it found the imposition of a seven-year period of parole ineligibility on a 22-year old shocking and eliminated the period of ineligibility. In reversing the judgment of the appellate court and reinstating the trial court's sentence, the court held that given the totality of the circumstances (i.e., defendant's failure to respond to prior non-custodial efforts at rehabilitation and his conduct that was escalating in violence), the trial court's decision to impose an extended term with a period of parole ineligibility was made in essential accord with applicable sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court eliminating defendant's period of ineligibility for parole and reinstated the sentence imposed by the trial court because it found that the trial court's decision to impose an extended term with a parole ineligibility period did not constitute such a clear error in judgment as to have warranted appellate revision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged in the lower court and convicted of first degree robbery and as an accomplice to first degree robbery. Defendant was sentenced pursuant to the Graves Act, , N.J. Stat.

The court reversed, holding that the lower court erred in its instruction, which failed to convey to the jury that in order to convict the defendant as an accomplice to robbery in the first degree, it had to find that the defendant had the purpose to participate in that crime as defined under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:15-1b. The court further held that the excessive cross-examination of the defendant concerning his knowledge of other alleged crimes of the principal was erroneous as well.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant disabled persons were denied benefits under the New Jersey Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled Act (PAAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30: 4D-20 to -35, because appellants did not receive SSDI benefits. Appellants argued that the statute violated the equal protection clauses because it irrationally discriminated between those financially eligible disabled persons who received SSDI benefits and those who did not. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgment, as did the court, because it withstood scrutiny under both the state and federal constitutions. The classification was sustained under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. It passed scrutiny under the state constitution because there was an appropriate governmental interest suitably furthered by the differential treatment. The purpose was to minimize the program's costs while maximizing its benefits to recipients, and the classification was rational, even though it was not the wisest, because it furthered the goal by eliminating the administrative costs that would have been incurred if the state were to make independent disability determinations.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of appellee, and concluded that a determination of unconstitutionality could be made only by the courts of New York. The judgment was affirmed on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent residential homeowner converted the attached garage of his residence into a recreation room, preventing the storage of a car. After the conversion, respondent applied to appellants, zoning board and municipality, for a variance after the building inspector granted a certificate of occupancy conditioned on obtaining a variance. Appellants denied the variance because respondent had failed to prove sufficient hardship. Respondent filed suit against appellants. The trial court found in favor of respondent, holding that the applicable zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The intermediate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court reversed and held that the provision for an on-site garage space as a structural requirement in this area of the community was a valid exercise of the zoning power. The court ruled that the lower courts erred in concluding that the ordinance did not reasonably advance any of its purposes because the ordinance did not mandate use of the garage for car storage. The court found that the rational relationship between the means chosen to achieve the legitimate zoning purpose was at least debatable, and the ordinance was, therefore, sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court, Monmouth County (New Jersey), which convicted him, inter alia, of murder, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3a, and sentenced him to death pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction of murder, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3a, and death sentence imposed pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3. The court affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court held that the denial of defendant's motions for change of venue were not in error as the pre-trial publicity, though pervasive, did not result in an unfair or partial jury. However, the court held that the verbatim N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3c(4)(c) charge on aggravating circumstances failed to channel the jury's discretion and was impermissibly vague. Additionally, the court sua sponte determined that the charge constituted plain error as it failed to provide that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating ones. For purposes of retrial, resentencing could not be considered double jeopardy as the first sentence was for death and the evidence was sufficient, but the state could not charge any aggravating circumstances that were not found in the first sentencing phase. A new jury could be impaneled, and defendant could rely on the transcript, so long as the state was allowed to rebut.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction of murder but reversed the death sentence and remanded for resentencing, because the trial court's verbatim statutory aggravating circumstances charge did not instruct the jury that the state had the burden of proving that the aggravating circumstances must outweigh the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The trial court charged the jurors to continue deliberating and emphasized the importance of reaching a unanimous verdict. Eventually the jury found that two aggravating factors, the vileness of the murder and defendant's prior murder conviction, outweighed the mitigating factors of defendant's mental stress and mental defect, and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court upheld the constitutionality of the New Jersey Capital Punishment Act and affirmed defendant's conviction. However, the court reversed defendant's death sentence and directed that, on remand, defendant was to be sentenced to a prison term. The court found that the trial court gave improper supplemental charges that undoubtedly coerced the jurors to conclude that a unanimous verdict was their only acceptable alternative. The court held that the trial court committed a reversible error by failing to inform the jury of the statutory option of returning a final, non-unanimous verdict that would result in defendant's imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed his sentence. The court held that the Capital Punishment Act was constitutional. The court reversed the sentence because the jury was improperly relieved of the full responsibility for the death decision as a result of coercive supplemental jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death under the Capital Punishment Act (Act), 1982 N.J. Laws c. 111. Defendant contended that the Act was unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions. Defendant also contended that various trial errors warranted reversal of defendant's conviction and sentence. The court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed his sentence and directed that, on remand, the death penalty could not be imposed on defendant and that defendant was to be sentenced to imprisonment for a specific term of years with no parole eligibility for 30 years. The court held that the Act was constitutional in all respects under the federal and state constitutions. However, the court held that the trial court gave impermissible supplemental instructions to the jury during the sentencing phase that coerced the jury to reach a unanimous verdict as the instructions incorrectly suggested different kinds of adverse consequences that would have been caused by a hung jury. The court held that the supplemental instructions improperly relieved the jury of full responsibility for the death decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed the judgment of the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, which held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C-29-3b(4) was not applicable where defendant was stopped for a routine traffic violation and, in response to a request by the police officer for his name, gave a false name.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped twice during the same day by the same police officer for routine traffic offenses. On both occasions, he was asked his name. During the initial stop, defendant gave a false name, but, on the second stop, he gave his correct name. Recognizing the discrepancy, the officer charged defendant with a violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-3b(4), which made it a crime to volunteer false information to a law enforcement officer. The trial court dismissed the false information charge because it found that an individual who responded to a question from an officer had not &quot;volunteered&quot; that information. Thus, a requirement of the statute was not met. The lower court affirmed the judgment. On appeal, the state argued that the lower court erred in its construction of the statute. In affirming the judgment, the court found that penal statutes were strictly construed and must be sufficiently definite to advise ordinary people of the conduct which they prohibited. Given the plain language of the statute, its legislative history, and its similarity to another statute, the court found that it was not applicable to the circumstances in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal of the false information charge against defendant because, based on the plain language and legislative history of the controlling statute, the state could not have prosecuted defendant for volunteering false information where he gave a false name in response to a question from the police at a routine traffic stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for possession of controlled substances and possession with intent to distribute after his property was searched and drugs were discovered. A search warrant had been obtained based on an informant's conclusory, non-specific observations and on a police officer's statement that, afterwards, he saw defendant engage in what appeared to be a drug transaction. Defendant's motion to suppress was granted. The lower court affirmed, from which the state appealed. The court affirmed, holding that New Jersey did not recognize the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. Federal courts recognized the rule that evidence seized pursuant to a warrant issued without probable cause need not be excluded if the police officer who executed the warrant objectively relied in good faith on the defective warrant in gathering evidence. The court held that N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, guaranteed New Jersey citizens protection from unreasonable search and seizures, that uniformity between federal and state courts was not essential, and that the exception would erode the effective procedures employed by the criminal justice system to accommodate the constitutional guarantee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment affirming the trial court's grant of defendant's motion to suppress evidence, as the warrant was defective and there was no good faith exception to the state constitutional exclusionary rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner law firm sought review of N.J. Ct. R., Code Prof. Conduct DR 7.2(a), contending that it violated the U.S. Const. amend. I right to freedom of speech. Rule 7.2(a) prohibited attorney advertisements from using drawings, animations, dramatizations, music, or lyrics, and required all advertisements to be presented in a dignified manner. The court revised Rule 7.2(a) by limiting the specific restrictions to television advertisements and eliminating the dignified presentation requirement. The court held that the new requirement that an advertisement be predominantly informational served the substantial state interest of assuring that consumer decisions in selecting counsel were reasonable. The television restrictions served to prevent an undue irrational influence on consumers. The absolute restriction on extreme portrayals served the interest of preserving public confidence. Finally, the court held that the restrictions directly served these interests and were the least restrictive alternatives necessary to achieve these results. The Supreme Court Committee on Attorney Advertising was formed to determine compliance, conduct and report on studies, and issue advisory opinions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court, while not expressly granting petitioner's request to review the constitutionality of its restrictions on attorney advertising, modified its rule to require that all advertisements be predominantly informational, retained the prohibition on the use of drawings, animations, dramatizations, music, or lyrics in television advertisements, and prohibited extreme portrayals. The dignified portrayal requirement was eliminated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, unlawful possession of a weapon, and unlawful possession of a weapon without a permit. Another charge against him, possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, was severed on defense counsel's motion. After the jury's guilty verdict, the severed charge was tried before the same jury. That jury had just convicted defendant of charges that necessarily included a finding that defendant was in &quot;possession of a weapon.&quot; The jury returned a guilty verdict, and defendant appealed, alleging that the jury instruction deprived him of his right to a fair trial by jury, because it amounted to an instruction to the jury not to consider independently the question of possession, but rather to abide by its prior determination of that fact. The appellate court affirmed, and did so again after the court reversed its initial affirmation of the conviction. Defendant again appealed. The court affirmed its previous judgment that reversed defendant's conviction for possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, and the court held that the jury charge had the unavoidable effect of directing a guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial for aggravated sexual assault and possession of a weapon with an unlawful purpose, defendant requested a hearing to determine whether two prior convictions could be used on cross-examination to impeach his credibility. After conducting a hearing, the trial court ruled that the convictions could be so used. Defendant declined to testify and was convicted of aggravated sexual assault. The superior court affirmed the conviction, ruling that because defendant did not testify, the trial court's ruling was not reviewable on appeal. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that defendant did not have to testify at trial to obtain appellate review of the trial court's ruling that defendant's convictions could be used for impeachment purposes. The court found that defendant's testimony was unnecessary for a trial court to make the discretionary determination on the admissibility of prior convictions and for an appellate court to review the trial court's exercise of discretion. The court also found that defendant was not required to make an advance offer of proof because significant problems could arise by requiring defendant to describe his testimony before trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant municipalities sought review of the order of the Superior Court, Appellate Division, which held that local blue laws were invalid, as foreclosed by the state blue law, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;2A:171-5.8to -5.18, in a suit brought by respondent businesses found guilty of violating the local ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two originally separate actions, respondent businesses were found guilty of violating local ordinances, enacted by appellant municipalities, to require stricter blue laws than were required under the state's blue law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:171-5.8 to -5.18 (1959), under chapter 119 of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:1-1 to :98-4. In appealing the guilty verdicts, respondents raised the question of whether the state blue law foreclosed the power of a municipality to enact local blue laws. The appellant division ruled the local blue laws were invalid and appellants sought review. In the consolidated action, the court reversed the order of the appellate division, holding that the state law did not preempt the power of municipalities to enact blue law ordinances, which were not in conflict with the state law. As there was legislative intent that municipalities ordain their own blue laws, there was no basis for invalidating appellants' ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the appellate division's order, invalidating local blue law ordinances enacted by appellant municipalities, holding that the state law did not preempt the power of municipalities to enact blue law ordinances, which were not in conflict with the state law. Therefore, respondent businesses' contention, that the more general state law preempted the power of the municipality to enact more restrictive ordinances, was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor excused two female black jurors for these reasons, but did not excuse six white females, including five homemakers and one secretary. After jury selection, defense counsel made a motion for a mistrial, which was denied. On appeal, the convictions were reversed and a new trial was granted. The court granted certification and affirmed the judgment of the appeals court. The court held that the N.J. Const. art. I, paras. 5, 9, and 10 forbade a prosecutor from exercising peremptory challenges to remove potential petit jurors that were members of a cognizable group on the basis of their presumed group bias. The court determined the defendant had established that the prosecutor impermissibly excluded all black jurors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant unit owner purchased an apartment complex and began converting it into condominiums. Two months later, the Senior Citizens and Disabled Protected Tenancy Act, &sect; 2A:18-61.22 to 61.39 (act), was enacted. The act was designed to protect elderly renters from the conversion of their homes. The trial court found that the act applied retroactively. Respondent tenants and appellant sought review. The reviewing court affirmed and appellant again sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that the legislature's goal was to protect elderly tenants from eviction. The court found that the act's effect on appellant's contract rights under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 3., was reasonable and was substantially related to a legitimate goal. The court upheld the retroactive portion of the act as also having a legitimate legislative purpose supported by rational means. The court further found that appellant had not suffered a manifest injustice due to the fact that the legislation was pending when appellant purchased the property. The court found that it was appropriate for respondents to come under the retroactive portions of the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, which found that respondent tenants were retroactively protected as tenants, because the public interest to protect elderly tenants sufficiently outweighed the private rights impaired and because the statute did not result in a manifest injustice to appellant unit owner.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the convictions and remanded the cause for retrial. Defendant had previously been given Miranda warnings and had asserted his right to remain silent. Later he made a statement in response to interrogation by federal authorities who did not give defendant new Miranda warnings. Defendant made a second statement to state and municipal authorities after defendant had been reinformed of his Miranda rights. The federal authorities' failure scrupulously to honor defendant's intent to remain silent required the exclusion of both statements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a common carrier providing intrastate and interstate bus service, applied for a refund of excise taxes and the tax court held that the tax imposed by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:4-20&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce and ordered defendant Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles to refund tax payments. The lower court affirmed and defendant appealed as a matter of right. The director claimed that the tax's intent was not to restrict interstate competition or promote economic protectionism, that interstate and intrastate carriers did not compete, and that the state interest in promoting local bus service outweighed any burden on interstate commerce. The court rejected defendant's claims and held that the tax discriminated against plaintiff and other interstate bus companies in violation of the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Plaintiff was not entitled to a refund, however, because in the absence of statutory authority there could be no recovery of taxes voluntarily paid under a mistake of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Council on Affordable Housing was created in the Fair Housing Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27D-311 et seq., in response to litigation on the constitutional obligation to create a realistic opportunity for the construction of low and moderate income housing. Appellant townships challenged the validity of the denial of various motions to transfer litigation to the Council under the Act. The court ordered all of the cases transferred, as the Act's purpose was to transfer all such cases, except where unforeseen and exceptional unfairness, not applicable here, would result. Further, the Act was constitutional. It did not delay the constitutional obligation as there was no such timetable implicit therein and it was designed to satisfy this obligation within a reasonable time period. The builder's remedy moratorium applied to litigation, not Council matters and was never part of the constitutional obligation. It was speculation to claim that the Act would not achieve the construction of lower income housing. The Act provided many incentives that the judicial remedy did not have. Finally, judicial review of ordinances was provided for under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a suit by plaintiff landowners against defendant township challenging a zoning ordinance, the lower court reversed the trial court's decision that the ordinance was arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional. The court reversed the lower court's decision, remanding the matter to the lower court for reconsideration. It held that the lower court erred in finding that the ordinance was moot under the time-of-decision rule because it had been replaced by a new ordinance, noting that the new ordinance did not change the substance of the previous one, but merely corrected a technical inadequacy. Therefore, it concluded, the lower court erred in remanding the case to the trial court for consideration under the new ordinance. It held that plaintiffs had not failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by not applying for a variance, writing that such a remedy was inappropriate when plaintiffs were challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. Moreover, it held, because defendant alleged that the ordinance applied only to plaintiffs' property, it was appropriate for the lower court to address the legal question of whether it legitimately served the public interest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been indicted for theft. Pursuant to N.J. Stat.

Defendant was acquitted of theft and convicted of conspiracy. Following the conviction, on defendant's motion, the trial court arrested the judgment of conviction and dismissed the conspiracy charge. The trial court reasoned that the conviction could not stand because no overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy had been alleged in the indictment. The lower court affirmed. On appeal by the prosecution, the court found that neither an overt act nor the conspiracy itself was required to be alleged in the indictment. The court concluded that the application of &sect; 2C:1-8(d)(2) in this case did not offend the constitutional guarantee of indictment by grand jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent judge was ordered to show cause why he should not be removed from office and thereafter the court ordered his removal from judicial office. The claims that the proceedings should have been dismissed in their entirety on constitutional and statutory grounds were without merit and were rejected. They did not violate due process rights as the investigatory, prosecutorial, and adjudicative functions were separated. The special panel was strictly ancillary and its recommendations were purely advisory. Although respondent had been a productive, conscientious, and energetic judge to whom significant and substantial judicial responsibilities had been assigned, his conduct threatened the whole concept of government under the law. It was repetitive, not episodic or aberrational. He allowed his personal and family interests to override judicial obligations and misused the judicial office for these reasons. Further, his conduct was wholly inconsistent with his judicial obligation to remain objective, impartial, and dignified. Finally, although he demonstrated that he suffered from a medical disability, it did not provide a defense to removal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered respondent judge removed from judicial office because his conduct, which consisted of serious professional and personal shortcomings, demonstrated his unfitness for continued judicial service and warranted his removal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent director of consumer affairs contended that appellant automobile dealer's advertisement was misleading and deceptive to the consuming public in violation of the Consumer Fraud Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:8-1 et seq. The ad stated that many cars would be priced well below &quot;dealer invoice.&quot; The court held that N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13:45A-2.2(a)(7)(iv) prohibited comparisons to the &quot;dealer's cost&quot; or &quot;inventory price&quot; in an advertisement. Appellant asserted that the term &quot;dealer invoice&quot; was not synonymous with either &quot;dealer's cost&quot; or &quot;inventory price.&quot; However, the court reasoned that the term &quot;dealer invoice&quot; might be susceptible to the same misinterpretation by consumers because disagreement even existed among testifying experts at the administrative hearing. The issue was whether the ad itself was misleading to the average consumer, not whether it could later be explained to a more knowledgeable, inquisitive consumer. The court also found that N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13:45A-2.2(a)(7)(iv) was constitutionally valid in that it did not infringe on appellant's U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant minister appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey) affirming the trial court's decision in favor of plaintiff government that defendant had violated a municipal zoning law, Franklin, N.J. Ordinance 832, &sect; 504.1 (1976), by temporarily using his home to hold weekly religious services. Defendant claimed that the ordinance did not clearly forbid this religious activity and was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant minister used his home to hold religious services for his congregation until a permanent location could be found. The zoning law where defendant lived, Franklin, N.J. Ordinance 832, &sect; 404 (1976), designated different zone classifications for land use in the town. Section 504.1 of the ordinance provided that the only permitted use in the area of defendant's home was single-family houses, and churches and similar places of worship were excluded. The township charged defendant with violating &sect; 504.1 and the trial court, following a trial de novo, also held that defendant violated the ordinance by using his home as a church. Defendant appealed, contending that the ordinance was impermissibly vague under the Federal Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. V, and the State Constitution, N.J. Const. art. I, par. 1. The lower court affirmed on appeal and defendant sought further review. The court found that the phrase &quot;churches and similar places of worship&quot; rendered the ordinance vague as applied against defendant because its indefinite meaning failed to provide adequate warning or specific guidelines for fair enforcement. The decision was reversed and defendant's conviction set aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant municipality passed a vacancy decontrol ordinance and later attempted to repeal it by enacting a second ordinance. The second ordinance was defective because a majority of council members did not vote, so the council retroactively enacted a third ordinance, Morristown, N.J., Ordinance No. 0-25-82, to correct the defective ordinance. During the period between the second and third ordinances, plaintiff landlord leased units to new tenants at higher rents permitted under the first ordinance. Defendant claimed that plaintiff had to roll back these rents under the retroactive provisions of the third ordinance. Plaintiff objected and sought a declaration that the third ordinance's retroactive provisions were null and void. The trial court dismissed the complaint but the lower court reversed and held that the retroactive provisions were invalid. Defendant sought further review and the court affirmed, finding that retroactive application of the third ordinance was not supported by a rational public purpose and unconstitutionally impaired plaintiff's contract rights.

Plaintiffs were Title 1 tenured teachers who had filed administrative petitions with the state's Commissioner of Education against defendant local school boards seeking various tenure benefits prior to the date that the Spiewak rule was announced by the state's highest court. Upon review, the state's highest court held that, in general, the Spiewak rule was prospectively applicable. However, because plaintiffs had pending petitions at the time the Spiewak rule was decided, the rule was retroactively applicable to require defendants to calculate tenure benefits for six years prior to the date that the ruling in the instant case was made. Only those plaintiffs who had been terminated before the date the Spiewak rule was announced were exempt from this limited retroactive application of the rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether plaintiff foreign bank, notwithstanding its failure to comply with the filing requirements of the Corporation Business Activities Reporting Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:13-14, could maintain a mortgage foreclosure action. Plaintiff sued to foreclose mortgages on property owned by defendant property owners. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint because plaintiff had neither filed a notice of business activities report as required by N.J. Stat.

The trial court denied defendants' motion. The Appellate Division concluded that a certificate of authority to act as an executor, testamentary trustee, or guardian, issued by the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking to plaintiff, satisfied the Reporting Act exemption. The judgment was affirmed because the court held that the legislature did not intend the Reporting Act to apply to foreign banks.

Respondent state brought an in rem action to forfeit the auto, and, without hearing testimony, the trial court ordered vesting of the title in the county. Appellant sought review and argued that he had no knowledge that the car was to be used by his son in criminal activity. The court reversed, remanded for a plenary hearing, and ruled that, while N.J.

The court held that with such liberal construction, the statute survived a constitutional attack that it constituted an unlawful taking of property without just compensation.

In cross-appeals, plaintiff argued that defendant was estopped from paying plaintiff less than the maximum allowed by &sect; 5:5-66, and that defendant was required to repay horse owners for purse deductions made to pay plaintiff. Defendant argued that &sect; 5:5-66 was unconstitutional. The court modified and affirmed, ruling that the statute was constitutional and a reasonable exercise of the police power because payments authorized by &sect; 5:5-66 served the public purpose of aiding New Jersey horsemen and were not paid from the state treasury but were simply diverted from bets made by racetrack customers. The court also held that defendant's past practice of paying the maximum allowed contribution to plaintiff did not act to estop defendant from later paying less, and that defendant was not required to repay purse deductions made for the benefit of plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The court held that when an accomplice was found guilty of an offense that was committed with a firearm, he was subject to sentencing enhancements under the Graves Act (the Act), N.J. Stat.

The court held further that if an accomplice was convicted only of an unarmed offense, but the trial court found that the defendant nonetheless knew or had reason to know that his cohort would use or be in possession of a firearm in the commission of the offense, the accomplice was again subject to the Act's penalties.

The tax court found that the exemption afforded by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-8(e) was not intended to exempt newspapers as they passed between printer and publisher.

Ann. &sect; 54:32B-1 to -29 (Act), on the free-circulation newspaper industry. The appeal posed two issues concerning tax exemptions. The court had to determine what constituted a newspaper for purposes of the Act and reviewed the &quot;sale for resale&quot; exemption of the Act to discern its effect on free-circulation publication. The court concluded that the Act required some consideration to pass during the transfer of title or possession, although the Act was unclear as to the source of the consideration.

The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, finding that all of the line-item vetoes were properly exercised. Pursuant to N.J. Const. art.

The appellee appropriately exercised this power with respect to provisions relating to state aid to municipalities.

The tax court held that the method used constituted a rule within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), N.J. Stat.

The appellate court reversed, holding that appellee's actions were authorized by &sect; 54:10A-8. On review, the court reversed and reinstated the tax court ruling. The court recognized that the language of &sect; 54:10A-8 granted appellee needed broad authority to modify the statutory formula for determining a multi-state taxpayer's New Jersey tax base by which the tax was measured. But, the court held that the action taken by appellee was invalid absent the prior promulgation of rules in compliance with the APA, and that the actual determination to use such an allocation method required implementing regulations and recourse to rule-making procedures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant corporation repaired airplane engines and often returned them to out-of-state customers. Respondent, the director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, sought to assess sales tax on the services. When appellant sought review, the tax court granted partial summary judgment in favor of respondent, holding that the assessment was valid. The lower appellate court affirmed. Appellant sought further review and asserted that because many provisions of the New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-1 to -29, treated the sale of goods and services equivalently and only sales of goods within the state were taxed, the legislature could not have intended to tax services performed on goods to be delivered to out-of-state customers. Appellant also contended that because respondent had not attempted to collect the taxes in previous years, respondent was estopped from beginning to collect the tax. The court noted that the application of the principles of estoppel was generally inappropriate where the collection of taxes by a public body was involved. The court held the tax was valid and affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bank loaned money to the grantee of property that was held to be fraudulently conveyed. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the property against which a lis pendens had been filed several months earlier, giving notice of an action to have the conveyance declared void and a judgment declared as a lien on the property. Respondent bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to set aside appellant's mortgage. The lower court held appellant's mortgage partially invalid, stating that the rights of respondent as a creditor related back to the filing of the earlier lis pendens. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the effect of a notice of lis pendens in this context was limited to preservation of the rights of the party filing it. The court said that the test of when new matters could be related back to an earlier notice of lis pendens was whether the parties, the property to be affected, and the general purpose and subject of the lawsuit were the same. The court stated that the first and third factors were different; therefore, the new matters asserted by respondent did not relate back, and appellant's mortgage could not be invalidated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court convicted appellant of misconduct in office for selling a motorcycle owned by the police department, receiving stolen police identification cards, and distributing a controlled dangerous substance. The court affirmed the superior court judgment that sustained appellant's convictions. The court disagreed with appellant's contention that, because the entrapment defense of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:2-12, placed the burden of proving entrapment upon him, it violated the requirement that the state prove every element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that although the state must establish an offense, it was not constitutionally required to show the absence of entrapment beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the jury charge properly described the burden of proof for the entrapment defense. The court found that any confusion caused by the jury charge was beneficial to appellant. The court found that the jury charge on objective entrapment helped appellant. The court found that the jury charge clearly provided that whether appellant was predisposed to perpetrate the offense was a jury question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On petition for rehearing of a prior appeal, plaintiff injured party, supported by amici curiae, alleged that the court erred in giving retrospective effect to a decision in, which declared the tolling provision of the statute of limitations in actions against defendant foreign corporation, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action for personal injury, the court gave retroactive effect to its decision in a prior appeal that found the tolling provision of the statute of limitations in actions against a foreign corporation, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:14-22&nbsp;unconstitutional. Plaintiff injured party, supported by amici curiae, sought rehearing. The court directed defendant foreign corporation, supported by amici curiae, to respond only on the issue of retroactivity. Applying an equitable balancing test, the court reversed, in part, and held, as a matter of law, that the earlier decision invalidating a civil statute was to be applied prospectively from the date of the decision. It concluded that the ruling established a new principle of law. At the time plaintiff started his action, the tolling provision for foreign unrepresented corporations was in effect; after the decision there was no such provision. The reliance of plaintiff and those similarly situated that under the statute their actions would be preserved, and the absence of a demonstrated burden to defendant and corporate amici, supported a prospective application of the decision.</SPAN></P>

Establishing a new rule of law and balancing the reliance of plaintiff injured party and the lack of burden on defendant foreign corporation supported a prospective application of the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, decedent and executrix, brought a libel action against appellants, newspaper and reporter, because of appellants' published article that linked decedent to organized crime, to which appellants responded with a motion to dismiss after appellee decedent passed away. The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court that upheld the denial of appellants' motion for dismissal by the trial court. The court ruled that the clause &quot;trespass to the person&quot; found in the Survival Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:15-3, included tort actions for libel and slander. The court determined that the issue of whether appellees' action should properly survive after appellee decedent's passing did not involve considerations of the U.S. Const. amend. I, which were already included within the prescribed scope of defamation law. The court held that appellees' action survived the decease of the injured party, appellee decedent, because the common law considered this libel to qualify as a trespass on the person under &sect; 2A:15-3.

The court concluded that the statute was not overbroad as it did not impinge upon any U.S. Const. amend.

The court found that the statute was not vague, as the words were a sufficient warning so that an ordinary person was apprised with a reasonable degree of certainty of that which was proscribed, and law enforcement officers were on notice that mere possession of a potential weapon was not sufficient to justify an arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the board could grant a conditional variance and allow appellants to purchase the lot at a fair and reasonable price, to be determined by the fair market value of the property as though the variance had been granted. The court found that the fair market value was the amount appellants had been offered for the property assuming a house could be built on it, and not the lower amount that appellants had offered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were each charged with driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, based in part upon breathalyzer tests. Plaintiffs brought an action against defendants, state and others, alleging that certain breathalyzer models were unreliable and that their use to furnish evidence of guilt was unconstitutional. The impetus was a municipal court decision that those models were unreliable because of susceptibility to radio frequency interference. The appellate division affirmed the trial court's denial of class action certification and plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the ground of collateral estoppel but reversed the denial of defendants' motion to dismiss. The court certified the case, limited to issues relating to the reliability of the breathalyzer models in question. The court found that the breathalyzer models in question were scientifically reliable and accurate devices for determining the concentration of blood alcohol and that judicial notice could be taken of that reliability. The court found some radio frequency interference problems under certain circumstances and imposed some conditions for the admissibility of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, the court affirmed, holding that appellees were entitled to be considered &quot;prevailing parties&quot; for purposes of &sect; 1988.

Complainant Disciplinary Review Board alleged that respondents willfully and deliberately violated the ban on broadcast advertising in contempt of the state supreme court's rulemaking power. Respondents claimed that the broadcast restriction was unconstitutional and violated U.S. Const. amend. I. Respondents sought interlocutory review and moved to dismiss complainant's charges. The court remanded the cause for further proceedings by complainant. The court found that the constitutionality of the ban was not at issue and that the intentional violation of the rules of conduct was the paramount consideration.

After receiving many letters urging that defendant not be imprisoned, the trial court sentenced defendant to five years' probation on condition that he undergo a specified in-patient rehabilitation program and continue visits to an organization for alcoholics. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Noting that N.J. Stat.

The court found, among other things, that the guidelines for sentencing were not followed because N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-1(d) established a presumption of imprisonment. The court also held that the state's right to appeal under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-1(f)(2) was constitutional under the double jeopardy clauses of N.J. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a distiller, its subsidiary importer, and authorized wholesaler, challenged the judgment of intermediate appellate court that affirmed the order of the director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control finding that appellants violated N.J.

Appellants claimed denial of due process, equal protection and that the judgment violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was to be liberally construed and that reincorporating in a new state or having the authorized wholesaler register as a &quot;brand registrant&quot; under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:2-33.1 was not a legitimate means of avoiding the anti-discrimination statute. The court also held that due process was not denied as there was a fair hearing before the division, that equal protection was not violated as the actions of the director were a rational regulation of an industry and not an arbitrary interference in a fundamental right. The actions of the director, as an action of the state, were not subject to the Sherman anti-trust act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for burglary, theft, and criminal mischief. Counsel for defendant moved to suppress defendant's boots as evidence. The trial court granted defendant's motion, and the intermediate appellate court affirmed the decision. On appeal, the court held that the proper inquiry for determining the constitutionality of a search-and-seizure was whether the conduct the law enforcement official who undertook the search was objectively reasonable. Under the circumstances, the court held that the officer's execution of the arrest warrant in person was reasonable. Further, the circumstances of defendant's arrest disclosed that the officers exercised a legitimate investigatory technique in a proper and reasonable manner. The arrest of defendant at his home was reasonable, and the officer's act of following defendant upstairs was a reasonable consequence of defendant's own voluntary choice to go to his bedroom and get dressed. Finally, despite the absence of a search warrant, the seizure and inspection of defendant's boots was reasonable and constitutionally valid pursuant to the plain view doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cause was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the court, which on its own motion certified the cause, to clarify an ambiguity in the court's past interpretation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22, which tolled the running of the applicable statute of limitations in actions against foreign corporations that were not represented in the state, and to decide whether the statute violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand from the United States Supreme Court, the court had to determine the applicability and constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22, which tolled statutes of limitation for parties who were not present in the state for service of process. Respondent filed an action against a corporation that had a certificate of authority to do business in the state, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:13-4, and appellant foreign corporation that did not. The trial court granted the &quot;native&quot; corporation's motion for summary judgment, but denied that of appellant, ruling that the statute of limitations, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-1, had been tolled by &sect; 2A:14-22 because appellant was not represented in New Jersey by a person upon whom process could be served. The court held that a corporation must register under &sect; 14A:13-4 before it could file a notice designating an agent for service of process, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14A:1-6(4), and enjoy the benefit of &sect; 2A:14-1. Therefore, the court concluded that &sect; 2A:14-22 was a forced-licensure law that violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3, reversed judgment for respondent, and remanded for entry of judgment for appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant developer challenged the judgment of the intermediate appellate court that found that the Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA), N.J.

Appellant argued that respondent's actions exceeded its authority and were an unconstitutional taking of the property. Although primarily an environmental act, the court held that the legislative intent for CAFRA, expressly codified, was to promote the public health, safety and welfare and to advance the best long term interest of all people of the state. Holding that mandatory set-asides for lower income housing were constitutional and within the power of respondent and CAFRA, the court found the conditions imposed by respondent were not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable and that they were supported by substantial credible evidence. Nor was the property &quot;taken&quot; unconstitutionally because appellant did not demonstrate that in complying with the regulations it would not return a profit or a profit so low as to amount to a taking.

The trial court ruled that the Act was unconstitutionally vague, but the court below reversed. On appeal, the court concluded that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague. It was the defendant's intention and knowledge, and only the defendant's, that would trigger responsibility under the Act. The Act gave not only fair notice, but clear notice. Under the Act, anything capable of adaptation for use with controlled dangerous substances was drug paraphernalia. The issue for law enforcement officers was what the owner or operator's intention or knowledge was, to be determined by all of the evidence, not simply the nature of the goods, but also the manner in which they were displayed, advertised, and all other circumstances that logically bore on the intention or knowledge of the party who was the potential defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to an overnight recess during defendant's ongoing testimony, the trial judge reminded counsel that a previously entered sequestration order prevented him from discussing testimony with his client. The appellate court affirmed defendant's murder conviction, because the incorrect restriction of defendant's communication with his attorney did not result in prejudice. On review, the court reversed and held that the order that prohibited defendant from discussing his testimony with counsel during the overnight recess violated his right to assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions. The primary purpose of sequestration, which prevented a witness from being exposed to other witnesses' testimony, could not apply to a criminal defendant in light of his constitutional right to be present during his entire trial. The court further held that the court-imposed restriction constituted a deprivation of a right so fundamental that it was reversible error and prejudice did not need to be shown. The state failed to meet the heavy burden of proof required to establish that defendant waived his right to counsel. Accordingly, the matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand from the supreme court, the Superior Court, Chancery Division (New Jersey) determined that the Emergency Transportation Tax Act (ETT) did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1, in an action challenging the constitutionality of the ETT filed by plaintiffs, New York commuters against defendant director of taxation. The supreme court certified the matter for direct review on its own motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, New York commuters, filed suit against defendant director of taxation for declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs claimed that the Emergency Transportation Tax Act (ETT), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:8A-1 to -57, an obligation levied on the New Jersey-derived income of only New York residents, discriminated unconstitutionally against them. On review, the supreme court found that the ETT did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The matter was remanded to the trial court for plenary hearings on whether the ETT contravened the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1. The trial court held that there was no violation and the case was certified for direct review a motion by the supreme court. The supreme court concluded that the ETT violated the privileges and immunities clause. There was no substantial relationship between the tax imposed on plaintiffs and the burden imposed by them on the state's transportation system where the evidence showed that net ETT receipts exceeded plaintiffs' share of transportation costs. Under the facts, reimbursement was not warranted and the ruling was made effective prospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the judgment, holding that the Emergency Transportation Tax Act (ETT) violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause by imposing a tax burden on plaintiffs, New York commuters, which did not bear a substantial relationship to the state's transpiration costs. However, plaintiffs were not entitled to reimbursement and the ruling was made prospectively effective. On remand, judgment was to be entered accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were each being tried for separate murders and sought closure proceedings because of adverse pretrial publicity. The Superior Court (New Jersey) in one cause denied one defendant's motion, while the Superior Court, Warren County (New Jersey) denied the other defendant's motion but, thereafter, approved leave to appeal to the state supreme court, which granted an interim order allowing closure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were each arrested in connection with separate incidents, both involving the stabbing deaths of women. Defendants each filed motions to close proceedings to the public and press asserting that pretrial publicity would deprive them of a fair trial before an impartial jury. The motions were granted. Upon review, the court noted that the issue was whether the public and press had a right of access to pretrial proceedings while still assuring a constitutional requirement of a fair trial before an impartial jury. The court prescribed a balancing test to be used in resolving applications for closure. The court held that the trial court had to determine the likelihood of prejudice and the need for closure based upon relevant evidence that could impinge on a fair trial and selection of an impartial jury. Further, to accommodate the competing concerns of a right of access and the right to a fair trial, the trial court must be satisfied that the need for closure was shown by a preponderance of the evidence. The court vacated the closure orders instituted in defendant's causes and directed the transcripts of the proceedings to be released to the public and the press.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient was scheduled for surgery and he participated in routine pre-admission procedures where he signed the informed consent forms. Subsequently he suffered setbacks after surgery; he was readmitted to the hospital. After readmission appellant learned that his own doctor had not performed his surgery. Appellant claimed that he was subjected to a battery because strange doctor subjected him to unwanted touching, or a violation of the informed consent law or the physician had purposely deceived him. The trial court allowed pre-certification panel's report into evidence, but it would not allow appellants to cross-examine any of the panel on their biases in favor of appellant's doctor whom some of the panel admitted to knowing. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial. It held that the trial court improperly withheld appellant's right to impeach the panel, and that the switch in doctors without appellant's permission amounted to either battery, informed consent violation, or to purposeful deception on part of hospital or doctors or both. The court said that no equal protection claim existed because appellant was not part of a recognized group.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landlord filed a complaint seeking damages from appellee tenants for breach of a commercial lease. Thereafter, appellants engaged a municipal constable to distrain appellees' goods by padlocking his store. Appellees filed a counterclaim asserting that the distraint was unconstitutional. The trial court sustained appellants' motion to dismiss appellees' counterclaim. The appellate court affirmed appellants' damages award, but reversed the dismissal of the counterclaim. The appellate court found that the distress constituted state action and that appellees were not afforded due process. Although the court concluded that the statutes pertaining to distraint were unconstitutional, it reversed the appellate court's judgment finding that appellees did not suffer damages as a result of the distraint. The court determined that the distraint by the constable constituted state action entitling appellees to procedural due process under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

The revision had been adopted on remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were lower income persons seeking housing in the city. The mobile home developer was permitted to intervene as plaintiff. They attacked the city's amended zoning ordinance passed in response to the previous case, which invalidated those portions of the existing zoning ordinance inconsistent with it. Instead of attempting to amend those deficiencies, the city simply added three new zones to meet its fair share obligation. The trial courts concluded that the city acted in good faith and with the express intent of compliance. The court reversed and remanded, finding that the amended ordinance fell short of what was required; that it neither corrected the deficiencies of the prior ordinance nor otherwise affirmatively provided a realistic opportunity for the city's fair share of lower income housing. The court held that satisfaction of the Mount Laurel obligation was to be determined solely on an objective basis: if the city had in fact provided a realistic opportunity for the construction of its fair share of low and moderate income housing, it had met the Mount Laurel obligation to satisfy the constitutional requirement; if it had not, then it had failed to satisfy it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, pregnant women and abortion and welfare rights associations, brought suit against defendant state officials and contended that N.J.

On appeal, the court modified and affirmed the trial court. The court noted that the United State Supreme Court held that Medicaid funds could be limited to use for abortions only when the life of the mother was in danger. However, the court held that under the state constitution there was no rational basis to make a differentiation between life and health of the mother and held that Medicaid funds for abortion must be provided to protect the health of the mother as well as her life. The court held that Medicaid funds did not have to be provided for non-therapeutic abortions. The court denied attorney's fees to plaintiffs because plaintiffs did not prevail on their federal claims.</SPAN></P>

Appellant later submitted a new application for authorization to award the degrees and began to offer courses that would lead to a bachelor's degree before it received authorization. Respondent sought an injunction that was granted. Appellant challenged the injunction and the appellate division upheld the injunctive relief. A concurrent federal action on these issues was stayed until the state action was completed. The court certified the matter and affirmed the injunction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner former police officer was given a suspended sentence and dismissed as police chief for a single count of malfeasance in office for fixing a traffic ticket. Respondent Board of Trustees, Police and Firemen's Retirement System denied petitioner's application for accidental disability retirement benefits and held that petitioner did not meet the prerequisite of honorable service for a pension. The lower court affirmed. On review, the court reversed and remanded the case to respondent. The legislature addressed the consequences of misconduct by public employees in various statutes, including N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:51-2a(1)-(2). Because the legislature provided specific reference to forfeiture in some pension statutes and not in others, absolute forfeiture was not warranted absent clear legislative intent. The court used a balancing test that incorporated 11 factors and found that the single act of malfeasance after 20 years of honorable service, the absence of a pattern of misconduct, lack of personal gain, and the imposition of adequate criminal sanctions did not support automatic forfeiture of all benefits. Partial forfeiture was to be measured from the date of misconduct.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had previously represented the defendant in a civil case and assisted the attorneys in the criminal trial although appellant was not attorney of record at the time of the press conference. An ethics committee recommended that appellant be charged with violations of N.J. Ct. R., R. Prof. Conduct 1.102(a)(5), and 7.107(d). Appellant filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of the disciplinary rules. The court ordered certification of the ethics complaint and directed the entire record be considered by the court. The court held that record was insufficient to make factual determinations in the case and dismissed the charges, but made certain rulings to explain the appropriate ethics principles that would be applied prospectively only. The court concluded that the reasonable likelihood standard of 7.107(D) was constitutional as applied to the extrajudicial statements of an attorney who was associated with a criminal trial, where the statements were about the trial and were intended to be disseminated publicly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant municipality's sewage plant polluted a lake. After plaintiff property owners brought an action, the appellate court held that it had been erroneous for the trial court to exclude instructions on defendant's liability in nuisance and also held that defendant was not immune from suit under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (Act), N.J Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:1-1 et seq. Defendant sought review, and the court affirmed. Although the Act had not expressly authorized nuisance actions against public entities, the court interpreted N.J. Stat.

The court also found that defendant had not been entitled to plan and design immunity under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:4-6, nor was defendant entitled to discretionary immunity under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:2-3. The court found defendant was not entitled to plan and design immunity because defendant had yet to prove damages had resulted from a specific plan or design.

The court held that the state association could not, on the basis of membership, deny New Jersey horsemen the right to participate in the benevolent programs financed by the statutory allotment. The court construed the statute to impose restrictions upon the state association's use and accounting of allocated funds, and found that as a means of funding programs to benefit those employed in thoroughbred racing in New Jersey, the statute was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court struck down the New Jersey Legislative Oversight Act (act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52:14B-4.1 to -4.9 (1981) as unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers under N.J. Const. art. III, para. 1 (1947). The court found that the act allowed appellant legislature to veto by a concurrent resolution any rule proposed by a state agency after the act's passage, with certain exceptions. The court found that the act's grant of power to appellant to revoke at will portions of coherent regulatory schemes violated the separation of powers by excessively interfering with the constitutional mandate of respondent governor to execute the law faithfully. The court held that the act's legislative veto provision further offended the separation of powers by effectively allowing appellant to amend or repeal existing laws without respondent governor's participation. This process also contravened the requirement in N.J. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant directors challenged a judgment from the Superior Court (New Jersey), which ruled that if they were not removed from positions of control in the extensive corporate hierarchy of a holding company and its subsidiaries, then a gaming application would be denied, pursuant to the Casino Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:12-1 to -152. Appellants did not satisfy the standards as casino key employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In reassessing appellant directors' protest of the requirements under which they would be granted a gaming license, the court found that the final adjudication of the issues was a matter of considerable importance to the casino industry as well as the general public, because appellants had considerable influence. The court found that appellants failed to make a demonstration of good character in fact. Appellants maintained that the Commission's order unconstitutionally conditioned their licensure on the divestiture of their interests in non-New Jersey subsidiaries, a challenge that they mounted on the basis of the Commerce Clause, U.S.Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and the Due Process Clause, U.S.Const. amend. XIV. However, the court rejected their arguments and held that the Commission's divestiture order bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest, and no fundamental right was affected. The court held that permitting them to remain in or assume a structured, formal relationship of ownership, employment, or management in any subsidiaries, even a non-gaming one, would encourage their exertion of enormous power and influence. The judgment was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After reinstating the condition that appellant directors must not receive any remuneration from subsidiaries outside of New Jersey, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court with that modification. All provisions of the Commission's order were reinstated, and the Commission was directed to establish a new timetable for submission of the holding company's plans. A stay was vacated, effective ten days after release of the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city challenged a ruling from the Superior Court (New Jersey), which dismissed loitering complaints against defendants on the ground that the municipal ordinance had been preempted and rendered unenforceable by the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was whether plaintiff city's municipal loitering ordinance had been preempted by the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:1-1 to 98-4, prohibiting enforcement of the ordinance against defendants. The court's holding rested primarily on the preemption by exclusion clause of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-5(d), which prohibited enactment or enforcement of any local ordinance that conflicted with any policy of the state. Given the legislature's comprehensive intervention in the area, the court found the conspicuous absence of a loitering statute significant, because New Jersey's pre-Code criminal law included specific prohibitions on vagrancy and loitering, but those provisions were repealed and not reincorporated into the new code. The court concluded that the absence of a loitering proscription reflected a state policy to decriminalize such activity, so the court held that the preemption clause prohibited enforcement of plaintiff's loitering ordinance and the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which ruled that plaintiff city's enforcement of its municipal loitering ordinance against defendants had been preempted by the new state penal code, because there was a conspicuous absence of a loitering statute in the code, considering the legislature's comprehensive intervention in the area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landlord obtained a rent increase from a rent control board for capital improvements, notified the tenants of the decision, and filed an action challenging the rent increase as inadequate. The trial court set a new rent increase, and ruled that a notice to quit was not required to make it effective. The court affirmed the rent increase, but held that, after receiving authorization to increase rent, a landlord was required to give a valid notice to quit for the rent increase to be effective in any periodic tenancy, including a tenancy in a rent-controlled municipality, because a municipal rent control ordinance properly required that tenants be notified of a request for a rent increase, but did not protect all the interests covered by the common law notice to quit. Where a landlord had substantially complied with the requirements of a notice to quit and inadvertently failed to give notice on the precise anniversary date, a notice to quit was effective on the next anniversary date after receipt of the notice.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the regulation, because of the excusal clause, did not inhibit the free exercise of religion, and to permit the appellants to control what others may study because the subject may be offensive to their religious or moral scruples would violate the Establishment Clause. The regulation did not require any point of view, secular or religious, to be stressed to the exclusion of others.

As to noncovered NLRA situations, the court concluded that &sect;&sect; 34:13C-2, 34:13C-3 were valid, and &sect; 34:13C-1(c) with the excision of the phrase, or to supply from without the state, was likewise valid and did not violate U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court held that the Act did not violate the equal protection concepts of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent doctor was prosecuted for Medicaid fraud. Appellant state then proceeded civilly against him for reimbursement of the overpayment of Medicaid charges and for damages. The lower court reversed the penalty of $ 2,000 per claim as having been fundamentally unfair, but affirmed other penalties assessed by the director of the State Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (agency). The state appealed the lower court's decision. The court reversed the lower court and remanded the case to the agency. The court found that the penalties imposed by the agency did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws, double jeopardy, and cruel and unusual punishment because the remedies were civil, not criminal. The court found that the director of the agency had not used his discretion when he assessed respondent the maximum penalty. The court remanded the case so that the director could determine a reasonable sum. The court said that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30:4D-17(e), 30:4D-7(h) provided for recovery of overpayments, treble damages, and payment of interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner law firm was prohibited by the Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics from opening a New Jersey office under a name where none of petitioner's named partners had ever been members of the state bar.

The court held that the danger that deception would occur in the absence of N.J. Ct. R. 2-102(C) was sufficient justification to restrict petitioner's commercial speech. The rule did not violate the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because it presented little burden on interstate commerce, and any burden was wholly incidental to a valid regulation of the state bar. There was no violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1, because the right to use a specific law firm name was not &quot;fundamental.&quot; There were significant, rational distinctions between prohibiting the use of a firm name where neither named partner had ever been licensed to practice in New Jersey and requiring that law firms change their names whenever a named partner dies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to possession of marijuana, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-21a(4), and applied for a conditional discharge pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-27. The trial court denied the motion for a conditional discharge and, instead, sentenced defendant to jail time, probation, and a fine. Defendant appealed and the appellate division affirmed the trial court judgment, but the court granted certification and reversed the appellate division's judgment and remanded to the trial court. The trial court conducted a new hearing and again denied the motion for conditional discharge, which the appellate division then reversed. The state appealed to the court. The court again reversed the appellate division, because it concluded that the trial court did not clearly abuse its discretion in denying defendant a conditional discharge. The court ruled that the whole person, not just his occupation, should be considered in sentencing, and that public sentiment or outrage should not influence a sentencing court's decision. In this case, the evidence supported the judge's decision that defendant was not amenable to rehabilitation or correction of behavior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order that reversed the denial of defendant's motion for conditional discharge was reversed, because there was no clear abuse in the trial judge's denial of the conditional discharge because defendant's actions and statements supported a finding that he was not amenable to rehabilitation or correction in the sense the conditional discharge program contemplated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant contractors' association sought review of the decision of respondent New Jersey Department of Treasury, which approved the affirmative action plan enacted by respondent City of Camden pursuant to respondent's affirmative action rules, N.J. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 17:27-1.1 to -13.2, which plan established minority hiring goals for city contracts and established a city residency requirement for the labor force on city public works projects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent City of Camden (city) passed an ordinance mandating affirmative action by private construction companies that were awarded public contract works, establishing a 25 percent minority hiring goal for city contracts, and requiring that 40 percent of the labor force in city public works projects be city residents. Both requirements exceeded the minimum requirements set forth in the affirmative action rules of respondent Department of Treasury (department), N.J. Admin. Code tit. 17, &sect;&sect; 27-1.1 to -13.2. Appellant contractors' association challenged respondent department's approval of the ordinance. The court affirmed, holding that N.J. Stat.

The court held that the ordinance's requirements did not impede the promotion of equal opportunity, and in fact, questioned the fairness of any hiring practices that resulted in a work force with less than 25 percent minority workers, given the large minority population of respondent city. The court held that the resident hiring quota was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling and the convictions. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that defendants did not meet their burden of proof under N.J. R. Evid. 56. The court held that defendants failed to show that the expert's testimony was based on reasonably reliable scientific premises or that the scientific community generally accepted the existence of identifiable character traits common to rapists. Defendants offered no additional expert testimony, did not cite any scientific or legal writings, and failed to show that the proffered evidence had been accepted as reliable by other jurisdictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Due to overcrowding of inmates in state correctional facilities, defendant state governor invoked his power under the Civil Defense and Disaster Control Act (Act), N.J.

Plaintiffs, county executive and sheriff, challenged the validity of those orders. The lower court approved the orders, and the court affirmed on appeal. Prison overcrowding was an emergency and defendant governor did not have to wait until the danger actually occurred, as a substantial likelihood of immediate danger was sufficient. The orders were specifically tailored to the magnitude of the crisis and were not arbitrary or capricious. A three-part test was applied to determine that the N.J. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, senators, general assembly members, and taxpayers, argued that the practice of gubernatorial courtesy under N.J. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, para. 14 (1947) was a frustration of the legislative process through the &quot;pocket veto&quot; technique involved. They further argued that since the constitution did not permit discretion with regard to the timing of the presentment of bills, presentment could not be forestalled by either the governor or the legislature. Defendants, senate president and general assembly speaker, contended that this presented a nonjusticiable political question. After defendants were granted summary judgment, plaintiffs appealed. The court found that the issue was a nonjusticiable political question. The court held that in absence of a constitutional or statutory standard, it was not the court's function to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature. The court held the timing of presentment of bills was discretionary and such a practice was within the legislature's prerogative. The court held that N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with unlicensed transfer of a weapon and possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon, and on his motion the counts were severed. He was convicted of the first offense and, over his objection, the state introduced the conviction at his jury trial on the second offense to prove possession. Defendant appealed claiming that such use amounted to collateral estoppel in violation of his constitutional right to trial by jury. The appellate division affirmed and the court granted defendant's petition for certification. It held that the use of defendant's prior conviction in the trial of the second case constituted collateral estoppel against defendant and impinged upon his constitutional right of trial by jury under U.S. Const. amend. VI and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 9 because it was a preclusive device serving to establish affirmatively an essential element of the crime charged which had the effect of creating a near-mandatory presumption in the minds of the jurors as to the guilt of the defendant.

The court reversed the appellate court's decision that reversed the trial court's judgment that denied defendant's motion to suppress because the troopers had probable cause to search the suitcase found in the defendant's car and therefore, the scope of the search was not unreasonable. The court held that the search came within the automobile exception to the warrant requirement as understood at the time of the search. Accordingly, the evidence obtained in that search need not have been suppressed. The court held that the troopers had information aside from defendant's mere possession of a small amount of marijuana and that information was sufficient to suggest that other crimes were being committed and to constitute probable cause to search the car and its contents. The court held that the troopers did not unreasonably extend the scope of the search to areas of the car and its contents beyond those in which their observations provided sufficient probable cause to suspect evidence of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent police union filed a grievance against appellant city claiming a breach of the collective negotiation agreement by appellant. The court reversed the lower court's decision that the promotion clause came within the permissive category and was therefore enforceable because the promotion clause of the agreement was not permissively negotiable and was unenforceable as outside the scope of negotiations. The court held that the promotion clause deprived appellant of the discretion to diminish the police force or to deploy officers as it deemed best. The agreement precluded appellant from leaving positions in the police department vacant. The court held that although N.J. Stat. Ann. 40A:14-143 did not refer directly to filling of vacancies by promotion, it revealed a clear legislative intent to vest discretion in a municipality to demote or lay-off police officers for economic reasons. The court held that a municipality should also retain the discretion to forgo for economic reasons the filling of vacancies by promotions. The promotion clause requirement that all vacancies be filled within 60 days placed substantial limitations on appellant's policy-making authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff franchisee filed suit against defendant franchisor after defendant informed plaintiff that defendant intended to sell the franchised property, as allowed by a franchise agreement. The trial court held defendant could dispose of its property, so long as it compensated plaintiff for the reasonable value of plaintiff's business as of the date defendant sought to terminate the franchise relationship through nonrenewal. The appellate division and the court affirmed. The court held defendant violated the Franchise Practices Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:10-1 et seq., as it terminated a franchise without good cause, as defined in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:10-5 to include only failure by a franchisee to comply with the franchise agreement. The court held N.J. Stat.

The court held the appropriate relief was temporary injunctive relief to maintain the status quo during litigation or to give the franchisee time to move or close the business. The court held &sect; 56:10-10 permitted attorneys' fees on all plaintiff's efforts to obtain an injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which entered summary judgment in favor of respondent attorneys on the grounds that the statute that prohibited certain public officials and employees, including judges, from casino dealings was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent attorneys, former part-time municipal court judges, brought an action against appellant state and municipalities where they served as magistrates. They alleged that the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:13D-12 et seq., which prohibited members of the judiciary from casino dealings, did not apply to municipal court judges and alternatively, that it was unconstitutional if construed to apply to any member of the judiciary. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents. On direct appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, par. 1 conveyed a broad meaning to the term judiciary to include municipal court judges, and thus the statute applied to them. The court also held that the statute was constitutional. Though the regulation of the judiciary was a power conferred upon the court, it did not preclude the accommodation of lawful and reasonable exercise of the powers of the legislative branch. The statute had a significant governmental purpose of sanitizing casino gambling and its potentially corrupting effect upon government. Further, the statute was consistent with the judicial canons of ethics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a hospital, the health commissioner, and the attorney general, sought review of the decision of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which held that N.J. Stat. Ann. 26:2H-7 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that it constituted special legislation to exempt a specific hospital from the certificate of need requirement in contravention of N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 9(8) and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant health commissioner denied appellant hospital's request to construct a hospital without a certificate of need. While appellant hospital awaited a hearing the legislature passed N.J. Stat. Ann. 26:2H-7 which exempted the hospital initial certificate of need requirements. Respondent hospital filed an action against appellants and the attorney general intervened as a party defendant and health care facilities intervened as plaintiffs. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional as special legislation in violation of N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 9(8) and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed the order because the amendment, a grandfather clause, satisfied equal protection criteria. The court held that the fact that only one entity met the specific provisions of the amendment did not render the legislation special. The test was whether any health care facilities were excluded that should have been included. The court found that the classification rested upon a rational basis relevant to the purpose of eliminating of certificates of need for existing hospitals or those which had attained the planning stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff board sought to collect damages from defendant parents for damages their caused by defendant children at a public school. Defendants attacked the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:37-3, which imposed vicarious liability without fault on the parents or guardian of any public school pupil who willfully or maliciously damaged public school property. The court upheld the lower court's rejection of defendants' challenge on due process and equal protection grounds. The court concluded that the disputed statutory provision permissibly sought to compensate the public and to deter delinquent behavior by students. Those purposes were not unreasonable, nor an invalid basis for imposition of vicarious liability. As long as the means chosen by the legislature had a rational relation to obtaining the objective sought, the statute was not in violation of due process of law or an arbitrary or capricious enactment. The court remanded the case with directions for the trial court to reconsider whether plaintiff's summary judgment motion should be granted in light of this opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the hearing on defendant's motion for modification of his sentence in which defendant was granted probation after serving a portion of his prison term, the trial court failed to advise defendant that violation of probation could result in an increased sentence. At defendant's probation violation hearing, the trial court was advised that seven detainers were pending against defendant, that defendant was serving time for a conviction for malicious damage and larceny, and that defendant faced additional punishment for contempt of court. The trial court revoked both the probation and the suspension of the original 3-5 year sentence, imposed a 5-7 year sentence, and refused to grant credit for probation time or prior time served.

VI &sect; II, par. 3, it denied lawyers equal protection of the law, it denied attorneys the right to trial by jury, and the unappealability of Fee Arbitration Committee determinations violated both the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend.

Because lawyers are not a protected &quot;suspect class,&quot; the court held that it need only prove a rational basis to assure the reasonableness of attorney-client fees. The court held that the state has a special interest in regulation the legal profession and attorney-client relationships.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant highway authority sought review of an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which declared unconstitutional an amendment to the New Jersey Highway Authority Act, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature amended the New Jersey Highway Authority Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:12B-1 et seq. to allow the governor and either the state treasurer or the comptroller of the treasury to effectively veto toll adjustments. Respondent bondholders sued appellant highway authority and claimed that the amendment impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 3. The trial court held that the amendment was unconstitutional. On direct certification, the court found that respondents harbored no reasonable expectation that the composition of appellant was immutable. The court held that the legislature could substitute the officers who administered a project without constitutional violation; that the amendment did not involve a substantial financial condition of the agreement; and that the state had authority to change the structure governing a public entity. The court held that N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 3 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 provided parallel guarantees and that the analysis of contractual impairment was the same under both. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents sought to have their mentally incompetent daughter sterilized. The hospital refused to allow the operation without judicially authorized consent. The parents requested such authorization from the trial court.

The trial court had the inherent power under its parens patriae jurisdiction to decide whether to authorize sterilization for the daughter. Although the court agreed substantially with the trial court's judgment, the court established a stricter standard for determining the question of sterilization and, thus, a remand was necessary.

On further appeal, defendant contended that the conviction illegally stemmed from a violation of federal and state constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly. While the appellate court found no state action to justify defendant's argument under U.S. Const. amend.

The state appealed the constitutional question to the appellate division court, which dismissed the appeal. The instant court granted the state's petition for certification to address the issue of whether the appeal was precluded by either court rules or the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The instant court ruled that the appellate division court should not have dismissed the prosecution's appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a medical doctor, worked for defendant, a drug manufacturer. Plaintiff opposed the development of a drug containing saccharin. In plaintiff's opinion, the saccharin's safety was medically debatable. Defendant removed plaintiff from her work on the drug project but told her that she could choose other projects. Plaintiff tendered her resignation, which defendant accepted. Plaintiff sued for damages for the termination of her employment. The trial court rejected defendant's argument that plaintiff's suit was barred because she resigned. There was a fact question of whether her resignation was forced. The trial court, however, granted defendant's motion for summary judgment because plaintiff was an employee at will and could be terminated at any time. The intermediary appellate court reversed and remanded. Defendant sought further review. The supreme court noted that plaintiff did not allege that saccharin was dangerous, but that it was controversial. Also, plaintiff's research did not violate medical ethics or any statute. There was no clear mandate of public policy that prevented plaintiff from working on the drug, and thus defendant was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent was arrested for the disappearance of his wife, advised of his custodial rights as required by Miranda, and taken to police headquarters. Respondent asked to consult with his attorney. Law enforcement officers intentionally eavesdropped on the conversations between respondent and his attorney and then charged respondent with murder. Respondent's attorney suspected that their conversations had been overheard when police seemed to know exactly where to search respondent's home. The trial court dismissed the charges against respondent and found that the eavesdropping denied respondent the effective assistance of counsel in violation of U. S. Const. amend. VI and N.J. Const. art. I &sect; 10. The court expressed its outrage at the actions of the police officers. The court held that, because respondent did not claim that his confidence in his attorney was impaired and it did not appear that trial strategy was disclosed, dismissal was not required. Before indictment, the court required the state to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it could conduct a prosecution with unsullied evidence and witnesses and that no tainted witnesses or evidence would be produced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant public advocate represented the adversaries of plaintiff township in a case to force compliance with a court order to modify plaintiff's exclusionary zoning ordinance. Defendant denied plaintiff's request to appoint outside counsel and rejected plaintiff's claim for legal expenses. The trial court dismissed plaintiff's claims and the court ordered direct certification of plaintiff's appeals. The court held that the Department of the Public Advocate Act of 1974 (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27E-1 to -47, did not violate the separation of powers clause, N.J. Const. art. III, para. 1, and was a valid delegation of its authority to a governmental agency. The court held that the Act did not violate N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, para. 3 because the mere fact that a public expenditure benefitted a private party did not render the expenditure unconstitutional. The court held that defendant's decision denying reimbursement to plaintiffs was well reasoned, based upon sufficient information and knowledge of the issue involved, and clearly within his discretion.

Defendant township adopted an ordinance to limit the hours of operation of businesses in neighborhood-commercial zones. The trial court and appellate court rejected plaintiff's constitutionality challenge of the ordinance. The court first affirmed the denial of plaintiff's motion for a new trial to produce additional evidence under N.J. R. Civ. P. 4:49-1 because plaintiff offered no reason for its failure to produce the evidence at the time of trial. The court also affirmed that defendant had authority under its police power to make ordinances for the public health and welfare, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48-2. N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7 (1947) provided that any such ordinances should be liberally construed in favor of the municipality.

The Appellate Division, Superior Court, reversed the conviction, holding that the ordinance was an unconstitutional restriction on respondent's freedom of speech. The court found that a community had the right to regulate signs and other structures to maintain the aesthetics of the area. The court found that an ordinance which restricted U.S. Const. amend. I political speech would be given greater scrutiny than an ordinance regulating other types of speech. The court found that the sign restriction had to be tied to a compelling municipal interest as well as to the uses permitted in an area. Applying this standard, the court held that the constitutionality of the ordinance here could not be sustained. The court affirmed, holding that adequate alternative means of political communication were not available to owners who are precluded from putting signs and posters in their yards, so the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant and plaintiff appealed.

If the decedent's financial resources were insufficient, plaintiff could then seek satisfaction from the income and property of defendant. The court found that the common law rule concerning necessaries, with its inherent discrimination against husbands, constituted a denial of equal protection of the laws under the state constitution. However, in the absence of an agreement that defendant would pay for the care of decedent, plaintiff could only seek payment from defendant after it was determined that the financial resources of decedent were insufficient.

Respondent employed the tolling provisions of the statute of limitations, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22 in order to bring their suit within the limitations period. The tolling provision specially applied to appellant as a foreign corporation. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The court held that the tolling provisions applied even though appellant was amenable to service under the long-arm statute. Although appellant argued that the tolling provisions violated the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the court held that there was a rational basis for differentiating between in-state and out-of-state defendants because long-arm service was more burdensome then service within the state.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's policies named the property owners as insureds and plaintiffs as mortgagees. Upon review, the court held that plaintiffs retained insurable interests in their respective properties although the city held title through foreclosure. Plaintiffs' insurable interests were not required to rise to the level of legal or equitable title as long as plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation that the fire policies would reimburse them in case of fire loss. Both plaintiffs continued to occupy and operate their businesses from the insured premises after the city foreclosed. Plaintiffs' continuing possession left them with insurable interests of value.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee health commissioner's approved regulations required appellant nursing homes to make available &quot;a reasonable number of their beds to indigent persons&quot; as a condition of licensure. Appellants objected to the regulations but the lower court upheld implementation of the regulations. Appellants sought review and argued that the regulations constituted a taking of private property for public use without just compensation, the language of the regulations was unconstitutionally vague, and violated equal protection. On review, the court found that the regulations were directed at a social problem affecting the health and welfare of the needy, aged, and infirm, and appellee was well within the agency power granted by the legislature. Also, this did not constitute a taking of private property without just compensation. The court found that the terminology challenged by appellants was definite enough to satisfy the requirements of due process and were not impermissibly vague. The court observed that the regulations applied to both private and public health care facilities and that appellants failed to show lack of a rational basis for the regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed defendant's convictions for possession of marijuana in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-20(a)(4), and possession with intent to distribute in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-19(a)(1), on the ground that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized during a random traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While defendant's appeal from his convictions for possession of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute was pending, the United State Supreme Court held that random traffic stops were constitutionally invalid. The appellate court gave retroactive application to that holding and reversed defendant's convictions because the trial court refused to suppress evidence that was seized from defendant's car after it was stopped for a routine license and registration check. The State appealed, and the court reversed the appellate court's judgment because the new rule of law applied only to random traffic stops that occurred after the date of the United States Supreme Court's decision. The court determined that illegal searches would not be deterred by retroactive application of the new rule to law enforcement actions that were undertaken in good-faith reliance upon previous long-standing legal authority. The court rejected the argument that summary orders by the United States Supreme Court directing remand for reconsideration in light of new exclusionary rule decisions mandated retroactive application of such new decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that reversed defendant's convictions. The court held that the rule that random stops for credential checks were constitutionally invalid could not be retroactively applied to random stops that occurred before that rule, which was a radical departure from state law, was announced by the United States Supreme Court. The court remanded the case for consideration of defendant's remaining contention for reversal.</SPAN></P>

The court modified and found that after eight years of protracted litigation, it was proper that the trial court gave respondent 120 days to amend its zoning ordinance to permit multiple dwelling use on appellant's property. The court noted the trial court's frustration with respondent's continuous efforts to rezone the property so as to have permitted the most restrictive use of the property. The court found that respondent's amended restricted commercial zone was identical to the initial zoning category in that neither permitted a feasible use of appellant's land. The court held that under the initial ordinance, appellants were entitled to a variance.

Plaintiffs argued that the tax constituted an equal protection and a privileges and immunity violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, New York residents who commuted to work in New Jersey, brought suit challenging the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:8A-1, which imposed an emergency transportation tax solely upon New York residents, claiming impermissible discrimination. After the trial court deemed the tax constitutional, plaintiffs appealed the adverse judgment. In affirming in part, the court concluded that there was no equal protection violation. The alleviation of a transportation emergency was a legitimate government purpose, and plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the imposition of the tax upon New York residents lacked any rational basis. In remanding the matter as to the privileges and immunities claim, however, the court concluded that because the record was insufficient to establish that non-residents were taxed only to the extent of their contribution to the transportation problem, it was unable to apply the correct standard of substantial equality. Remand was necessary to permit a full examination of the benefits and burdens to non-resident commuters occasioned by the transportation programs and imposition of the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant utility sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey). The appellate court upheld the res judicata effect of a 1916 decision, which held that the 1911 Public Utility Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48:3-1 and 48:3-4, did not invalidate a contract by appellant's predecessor and respondent city for free lighting service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent city contracted with the predecessor of appellant utility in 1898 to receive free lighting service for municipal buildings. In 1916, an appeals court held that the 1911 Public Utility Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48:3-1 and 48:3-4, which prohibited unjustly discriminatory or preferential rates, did not invalidate the contract. In the 1970s, respondent sought declaratory relief to determine whether appellant had to provide free lighting service for three new city buildings. The trial court ruled in favor of respondent, and the appellate court affirmed. The court reversed. The 1916 appeals court decision was not res judicata because the issue was one purely of law; a new adjudication was necessary to avoid inequity. The 1911 Public Utility Act had to be applied uniformly to all rates, including those set prior to the statute's enactment. Applying the act to rates set by the 1898 contract did not violate the contract clauses of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, or N.J. Const. art. 4, &sect; 7, par. 3 (1947). Where a state enacted legislation that abrogated a contract entered into by a municipality, the municipality could not seek protection under the constitutional contract clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment that an 1898 contract between respondent city and appellant utility's predecessor, which gave respondent free lighting service, was still enforceable. The 1911 Public Utility Act, which barred preferential rates, applied to invalidate the rates set by the contract. Respondent, as a municipal corporation, was not protected by federal or state constitutional contract clauses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two appeals were filed attacking new regulations adopted by the state division of alcoholic beverage control (ABC), one on behalf of liquor retailers and the other on behalf of wholesale solicitors. Both appeals challenged the power of the ABC to make certain changes in the absence of specific legislative authorization. Appellants alleged that the procedures utilized in adopting the new regulations violated due process. The specific regulations attacked included those which: (1) authorized quantity discounts, (2) regulated credit practices, (3) required purchases from state wholesalers, (4) banned cooperative advertising, (5) prohibited sales below cost, and (6) provided emergency measures for sales tax collection. The court concluded that elimination of retail price maintenance and allowance of price competition was within the powers granted to the ABC director by the legislature. The court ruled that the procedures employed in adopting the regulations satisfied due process and that the challenges to specific regulations were without merit, except for those prohibiting non-price cooperative advertising and providing emergency measures for sales tax collection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the action of the state division of alcoholic beverage control in adopting regulations as a permissible delegation of authority; specific regulations attacked by appellants were upheld, except for the ban on non-price cooperative advertising and imposition of emergency tax collection measures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the New Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19:44A-1 to 26, contending that those portions regulating the efforts of political information organizations to influence legislation were facially overbroad in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I. The trial court held the provisions invalid, and the intermediate court reversed. Using &quot;judicial surgery&quot; to effect a narrow construction of the challenged provisions, the court affirmed the intermediate court's judgment as modified. The court interpreted the phrase &quot;to influence legislation&quot; to mean activity consisting of direct, express, and intentional communications with legislators undertaken on a substantial basis by individuals acting jointly for the specific purpose of seeking to affect the introduction, passage, or defeat of, or to affect the content of legislative proposals. So construed, the court held, the Act was not facially overbroad. The court also set aside N.J. Admin. Code tit. 19, &sect; 12.1(e), an administrative regulation imposing a monetary threshold for enforcement of the Act's provisions, on grounds that the amount was too low.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Numerous parties, municipalities and their officials, appealed from decisions of the Superior Court (New Jersey) seeking certification and raising identical issues. Several municipalities and counties challenged the failure of the Governor and legislature and certain state officials to appropriate and expend state revenues pursuant to particular statutes which purported to provide funds for local government uses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant municipalities initiated litigation calling for disbursements of tax revenues, namely, the sales and use tax, N.J.

The court granted review of the several cases from the appeals courts. Several municipalities challenged the failure of the Governor, legislature and certain officials to appropriate and expend state revenues pursuant to particular statute, which purported to provide funds for local government uses. The challenges presented the court with questions concerning the appropriate constitutional framework governing the state budgetary process and the proper role of the courts in resolving conflicting claims between the state and governmental subdivisions over entitlement to state revenues. The court concluded the relief sought by the appellants could only be accomplished if there was a valid legislative appropriation. The lower court judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that it was not the proper role of the courts to resolve conflicting claims between the state and its governmental subdivisions over entitlement to state revenues, where the state constitution stated the legislature made such appropriations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant rental property owners challenged a judgment, in consolidated appeals, from the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey) that upheld the constitutionality of the Tenants' Property Tax Rebate Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-6.2 et seq. Appellants asserted that the provision of the act that included municipal-wide revaluation of property, but excluded property tax judgments when calculating reductions, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated appeals, the court affirmed a judgment that upheld the constitutionality of the Tenants' Property Tax Rebate Act (the act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-6.2 et seq. The act, recognizing that rent levels anticipate the tax burden on the rental property, provided that when there was a reduction in that burden, the property owner must share the reduction with his tenants. The court rejected appellant rental property owners' argument that the act violated equal protection rights when reductions resulting from tax appeal judgments were excluded from the calculation for the property tax reduction, but those reductions resulting from municipal-wide revaluation of property were not. Applying the rational relation test, the court found that the act did not violate equal protection when the reason for the distinction was practicality. The court noted that the necessary information would not be available in time to calculate the tax bills. The court stated that the provision that excluded the reductions resulting from tax appeal judgments applied not only to the year for which the reduction was calculated but also to the base year.</SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted defendant. In a trial de novo, the intermediate appellate court sustained the conviction. Defendant appealed. The court found that defendant's interference did not require total physical frustration. Defendant could not have been arrested for disorderly conduct solely because the arresting officer in bad faith found defendant's behavior annoying. The court affirmed defendant's convictions because an average person would have understood the nature of the emergency and found the officer's request reasonable. Defendant's position as a member of the press did not entitle him to additional protection. While the right of the press to gather news was entitled to special protection, U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant male challenged a decision of the Superior Court, Morris County (New Jersey) for appellant female. The primary issue on appeal was whether a man and a woman who were not married to each other, and who lived together without a promise of marriage, such as the parties in this case, had entered into a valid contract that was enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties in this case lived together for a total of 15 years excepting brief separations. Appellant provided financially while appellee provided services such as housekeeping, shopping, acting as mother to the children, escorting and accompanying appellant as he desired, and serving as hostess when necessary for his customers and business associates. The fact that that the parties had the same last name was coincident, because appellee's first husband had the same surname as appellant. Appellant challenged the lower court's decision for appellee. The case was transferred to the court prior to being heard by the appeals court. The court concluded that a man and a woman who were not married to each other and who lived together without a promise of marriage could enter into a contract that was enforceable regardless of whether the parties had a sexual relationship. The court concluded that any lawful agreement made by the parties was thus enforceable and was to be evaluated based upon the terms of the contract. The court affirmed the lower court judgment and remanded for further proceedings in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court judgment and remanded the matter for such further proceedings as in the trial judge's sound discretion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court (New Jersey) affirming the determination of the state division of taxation that plaintiff's capital gains transaction resulted in a taxable event as contemplated by the Tax on Capital Gains and Other Unearned Income Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:8B-1 et seq. Plaintiff contended that the retroactive effect of the statute as applied to him was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a former resident of New York, moved to New Jersey and sold securities, allegedly in reliance on the absence of a state capital gains tax. During the same year the state legislature enacted the Tax on Capital Gains and Other Unearned Income Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:8B-1 et seq., which applied to capital gains received on or after the first day of that year. The state division of taxation determined that plaintiff's capital gains transaction resulted in a taxable event as contemplated by the Act; the appellate division affirmed, and he sought review, contending that the retroactive effect of the statute as applied to him was unconstitutional because retroactivity was impermissible if the circumstances resulting in a taxable event were voluntarily created by a taxpayer. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that retroactive provisions of income tax statutes had invariably been held consistent with the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, and that the same rule would apply under N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1, especially in light of the need to apportion costs of government equitably and the reasonable notice provided of the pending enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the limited retroactive effect of the statute did not violate the state or federal constitutions under the circumstances, including the need to apportion the costs of government equitably and the reasonable notice provided by the public controversy and numerous income tax bills introduced in the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 2:2-1(a)(1), appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey) reversing the trial court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of an institutional construction bond issue approved by the electorate. The court reviewed whether the three construction projects at issue comprised a single object in the intendment of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court found that a bond issue, approved by the electorate, providing for the construction of three separate public projects violated the state constitution. That court held that the projects were unrelated measures, disparate objects or works, improvidently combined provisions, leaving only as the proffered basis for relating the several purposes of the enactment the fact that buildings were to be constructed from the proceeds of the bonds. On review, the court reversed, holding that the grouping of related projects in one statute had become an established pattern, one apparently compatible with popular understanding and will, and legislative acceptance. The court perceived a sure &quot;relatedness,&quot; fully meeting the constitutional norm among the institutional construction of the buildings, the purposes such institutions were to serve, the identity of those who were to be served thereby, and in the beneficent state resolve and commitment to them, i.e., the meeting of public responsibilities to the people of the state. The court found no constitutional imperative to strike down the determination of the legislature and the expressed will of the people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court ,reversing the trial court's determination that the institutional construction bond issue approved by the electorate was constitutional, was itself reversed. There was a sufficient relatedness between the construction of institutional buildings, the purposes and public they were to serve, and the state's effort to meet its public responsibilities to pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff doctor filed a complaint accompanied by an order to show cause in the superior court, seeking to restrain defendant hospital from conduction a hearing on his application for membership to the hospital staff until he was permitted to examine all pertinent documents in defendant's possession. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The trial court dismissed the complaint at the conclusion of the hearing. The superior court reversed and the court granted defendant's petition for certification. The court held that there was no crucial need which would justify judicial intervention because of the claim for discovery. The minutes particularized in some factual detail plaintiff's alleged inadequacies, and plaintiff would have become aware at the hearing of any other underlying data which defendant possessed. There was no reason to believe that defendant would not have afforded him additional time to prepare and present evidence in rebuttal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant minor child, through her mother, challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey which affirmed the ruling of the trial court holding that appellee welfare board was entitled to reimbursement of welfare assistance furnished on behalf of minor from recovery in a personal injury action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant minor child suffered severe burns on her left leg after it became wedged between a wall and a steampipe in a housing authority apartment where she lived with her mother. Appellant's mother executed a written agreement pursuant N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:10-4(a) to repay appellee welfare board from anticipated funds from a tort claim against the housing authority. After the tort action, appellee filed a complaint to recover the amount of assistance furnished. The trial court ruled in favor of appellee and the appellate division affirmed. An appeal on behalf of appellant was filed with the court as a matter of right. The court held that the agreement to repay and the right of appellee to collect payment was legal, but there were certain limitations on the exercise of the right. The court held that although the agreement to repay was signed by the mother on August 10, 1973, the trial court erroneously ordered repayment of the amount of welfare assistance furnished from May 1973, the alleged date of the accident. It was clear that the reimbursement provision of &sect; 44:10 as it then existed, extended only to the amount of assistance granted from the date of the agreement to repay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the superior court judgment, which affirmed the trial court judgment ordering repayment of welfare assistance furnished to appellant out of a tort recovery. The court held that an agreement to repay welfare assistance was legal, but that the statute that authorized repayment from personal injury suits extended only to the amount of assistance granted from the date of the agreement to repay, and not the date of the accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayers challenged the formula for distributing state equalization aid to local school districts, under the Public School Education Act of 1975, N.J. Stat. Ann. 18A:7A-1, et seq., contending that it denied due process and equal protection and had a chilling effect on the free exercise of their religion by excluding sectarian school pupils from the distribution formula. Appellants also contended that the use of enrollment figures without use of attendance figures was contrary to the statutory requirement. The lower appellate court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment to respondent public officials. The court held that the statutory classification used in the state aid formula manifestly was neither arbitrary, invidious, nor discriminatory in a constitutional or any other sense. To include non-public school pupils in the formula would have raised serious questions as to its validity. Moreover, the legislative history of the enrolled and attending phrase and its administrative interpretation over the years supported the trial court's interpretation of the statute. It would frustrate the plan for state aid to be diminished solely because of pupil attendance figures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review in a consolidated appeal of the orders of Passaic County Court, Union County Court, and Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which excluded appellants, charged with nonindictable offenses, from county pretrial intervention programs. Appellants contended their ineligibility violated their rights to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were charged with nonindictable offenses and each sought admission to his county's pretrial intervention program. Eligibility in those counties was limited to persons charged with indictable offenses. Appellants claimed their exclusion violated equal protection. The court affirmed, holding that the equal protection rights of appellants had not been violated by their exclusion from pretrial intervention programs. Petty nonindictable offenses were not crimes, but were penal offenses, within the meaning of N.J. Ct. R. 3:28 and its accompanying guidelines. Thus, indictable offenses, which were crimes, were automatically eligible for admission to the program, but the program was intended to be permissive as to nonindictable offenses. This did not violate equal protection because the classification was not of a suspect class nor concerned with a fundamental right. Thus, it was sufficient that there was a rational basis for the classification, including the need for local flexibility in rehabilitating offenders and reducing court calendars, as well as local administrative and fiscal constraints. Territorial uniformity was not a constitutional requisite.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy and other crimes based upon the misconduct of public officials while in office. The trial judge submitted to the jury special interrogatories relating to the applicability of the statute of limitations as a bar to the criminal prosecution. Defendant appealed his conviction. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the judge had committed plain error. The court held that the use of special interrogatories was improper because they had the prejudicial potential for leading the jury to adverse findings on the ultimate issue of guilt, and that risk was aggravated by the fact that the jury was directed to respond to the special interrogatories before it was asked to deliberate upon its general verdict, and without being fully instructed with respect to the law applicable to the criminal charges. The court held that the errors satisfied the requirements for plain error: the special interrogatories had the obvious capacity to lead the jury down the guilty trail, it could not be said beyond a reasonable doubt that they did not bring the jury to a result it might otherwise not have reached, and they were capable of producing an unjust result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners executors filed a transfer inheritance tax return with respondent New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Bureau. Petitioners listed among the decedent's assets a survivor's annuity that derived from an employee benefit plan of the decedent's employer. The annuity provided for annual fixed income payments to decedent's widow, which would continue during the remainder of her lifetime. In valuing the asset, petitioners claimed the right to take as a reduction the commuted value of all estimated federal income taxes that would be payable by the widow upon her annual receipt of those payments. Respondent denied the claim, as did the appellate court. The court affirmed the decisions. The court held that those taxes should not be taken into account to determine the market value of the annuity for New Jersey State Transfer Inheritance Tax purposes under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:34-1 et seq. The court held that it seemed reasonable to conclude that the legislature was anxious to increase revenues derived from the taxation of life estates and to adopt petitioners' position would go far to diminish or obliterate completely the gains foreseen and sought by this legislation.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, owners of multiple-family dwellings challenged the ordinance, claiming that it was unconstitutional because plaintiffs were deprived of a fair return on their investment. The trial court initially permitted the landlords to increase their rents to the consumer price index. The municipality then revised the ordinance, allowing increases based on a different formula.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff public advocate sought the opening of a beach and casino in respondent borough to the public, which had previously restricted use to casino members. Adjacent to the beach area was a beach, which was open to the public. Plaintiff's sole contention before the court was that the dry beach area immediately in front of the casino was subject to the public trust doctrine and should have been made available to the general public for proper enjoyment of public trust rights. The court reversed the judgment of the lower court in regard to the beach area because this area was under municipal ownership and dedication, was subject to the public trust doctrine, and all had the right to use and enjoy it. The public trust doctrine required that municipally owned upland sand area adjacent to the tidal waters must be open to all on equal terms and without preference. The court found that it was not significant that this area in its natural state was unsuitable for normal beach area and respondent's leveled a bluff and graded in order to create the beach area. The court held that respondent may adopt reasonable regulations as to the beach area under its exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected plaintiff's contentions that the statute was vague and had selective and discriminatory enforcement. The court found that the rationale behind the statute had a rational basis in relation to the specific objective of the statute. This rationale included recognizing Sunday as a day of relaxation and for play, hobbies, and relaxation. The court concluded that the trial court did not undertake to establish that the classification set forth in the Sunday Closing Law was devoid of any rational relationship to its validated purposes on any conceivable basis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant school board allowed local groups to use school facilities during non-school hours, if they paid the cost of janitorial services. Third-party defendant religious organizations rented various facilities for religious services and instruction. Plaintiff alleged that use of schools by religious groups violated N. J. Stat.

The trial court held that even use limited to education violated the prohibition in N.J. Const. art. I, para. 3, but that a rent schedule based on actual costs could cure that difficulty. The appellate division affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that religious groups who fully reimbursed school boards for related out-of-pocket expenses could use school facilities on a temporary basis for religious services as well as educational classes. The court also held that the lower courts erred in requiring sectarian groups to pay a commercial rental rate and in placing a one-year limitation on their continued use of the school premises.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed an action challenging the validity of the termination and alleging that he had been discharged without notice of the charges against him, in violation of his constitutional right to due process. The trial court transferred the case to the appellate court. The appellate court remanded the case to defendant, who found sound reason existed for the termination of plaintiff because plaintiff had initiated a violent altercation with another officer. Plaintiff filed a petition for certification. The court first determined that plaintiff was entitled to hearing because plaintiff could be disqualified from future state service upon removal. Therefore, plaintiff had a protectable liberty interest pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found that plaintiff was not notified of the charge against him or of other matters being investigated. Therefore, the court held that plaintiff was entitled to a post-termination hearing in order to protect plaintiff from future disqualification from public employment. However, plaintiff could not obtain reinstatement to his position. The decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pedestrian brought an action against respondent railroad and respondent employees for injuries sustained while appellant was walking on railroad tracks. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondents pursuant to the provisions of N.J. Stat.

Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to respondent railroad but reversed the judgment as to respondent employees. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:12-152 had to be strictly construed because it provided immunity from tort liability and could not be extended beyond its meaning. The court determined that the statute, by its terms, extended to the company owning or operating respondent railroad, but did not expressly include respondent employees in that protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state appealed a decision from the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed defendant's conviction for first degree murder on the ground that defendant's conviction was involuntary in the constitutional sense. Defendant also alleged that N.J. Ct. R. 1:8-2(d) was unconstitutional insofar as it permitted an alternative juror to be substituted for an original juror after deliberations had begun.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Waiving his Miranda rights, defendant confessed to murder during a tape-recorded interrogation at state police barracks. The confession was admitted into evidence over his objection that he had no recollection of the interrogation. During jury deliberations, an alternative juror was substituted for a juror who requested dismissal. On state's appeal of the reversal of defendant's conviction, the court held that the interrogation did not exceed proper bounds and the confession was not the result of intense and mind-bending psychological compulsion. The voluntariness of defendant's confession could properly have been determined by the trial court to be established beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, the confession was properly admitted into evidence. In this connection, the court rejected defendant's related contention that his confession was the product of strongly implied promises of an insanity defense and no prison sentence if he confessed. The court held that N.J. Ct. R. 1:8-2(d), in providing that for good cause shown an alternate juror could be substituted for a regular juror after deliberations had begun, did not offend the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment reversing defendant's conviction for first degree murder was reversed on the ground that the use of a psychologically oriented technique of questioning defendant was not so inherently coercive as to result in an involuntary confession in the constitutional sense. Substitution of juror during deliberations was proper under the circumstances and did not offend the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a non-profit guild and two of its officers, challenged an appellate court decision upholding the validity of state regulations enacted under a state statute governing the sale and distribution of hearing aids.

Plaintiffs also contended that the regulations were preempted by a proposed federal regulatory scheme. The court dissolved the stay of enforcement and affirmed the judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs' contention that the statute never envisioned regulating the business aspects of hearing aid dispensing was without foundation, and the federal regulatory scheme implicitly allowed supplemental state regulation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimant challenged an appellate court decision which affirmed the rejection of appellant's claim to a civil service appointment that went to a veteran under N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:27-4. Appellant scored the highest on the test for the position, but the job went to a veteran. Appellant claimed that the preference for veterans in civil service positions violated N. J. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, par. 2, and the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of U. S. Const. amend. XIV. The court disagreed and affirmed the appellate court decision. The veterans' preference law was essentially similar to that which was &quot;provided by law&quot; at the time the Constitution was enacted, so the approval of the Constitution by the people of New Jersey was thus a virtual ratification of the scheme for veterans' preference in the civil service. Veterans had to demonstrate merit by passing a competitive test in order to be entitled to preference, so the preference was not violative of due process. Finally, the system was gender-neutral and did not violate equal protection merely because it disfavored women to a substantially greater degree than other non-veterans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision rejecting appellant claimant's complaint regarding her entitlement to a civil service position. The statute granting a preference to veterans was approved by the voters when they adopted the state constitution, did not violate due process because it retained a merit component and was gender-neutral on its face so it did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent individual and corporation sought an adjudication that a &quot;Buy American&quot; provision in bidding specifications be declared invalid and its statutory foundation unconstitutional. The trial court declared the provision invalid but permitted the bids to stand. The court below agreed with the trial court as to the invalidity of the provision but held that the bids were void. On appeal, the court found that appellant water commission's purchases of materials and equipment for its water treatment plant were for governmental purposes and not with a view to use in the &quot;production of goods for commercial sale.&quot; The purchases were exempted from the operation of Article III of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 62 Stat. 3681 (1948). Further, the court held that the &quot;Buy American&quot; statutes,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:33-2 and -3 did not violate the Commerce Clause. The &quot;Buy American&quot; statutes did not impermissibly interfere with the federal government's conduct of foreign affairs.

The decision that upheld the constitutionality of the statute upon defendant's conviction for fornication was affirmed. On review, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional and selectively enforced. The court reversed and held that the statute prohibited defined conduct that involved a fundamental personal choice and therefore infringed upon defendant's constitutional right of privacy. The court also relied upon the constitutionally mandated zone of privacy that protected individuals from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters of intimate personal concern. The court also concluded that the compelling state interests of preventing venereal disease or protecting marital relationships and the public morals did not justify the statute's impingement upon the fundamental right of privacy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent employer appealed the decision of the Workers' Compensation Division of Superior Court (New Jersey), which awarded benefits as a total dependent to petitioner surviving husband without the proof of a widower's dependency required by N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner surviving husband brought a workers' compensation dependency claim against respondent, his deceased wife's employer. The workers' compensation judge found the dependency provision in N.J. Stat.

On review, the administrative order as modified was affirmed. The court held that the gender based dependency provision in &sect; 34:15-13(f) and the gender based distinctions that governed the duration and computation of workers' compensation benefits were unconstitutional. The statute was premised upon archaic and overbroad stereotypes regarding the economic dependency of women and denied female workers protection for their families equal to that afforded comparable male workers. The remedy that prospectively applied to widowers was upheld, but the award was modified to reflect decedent's full-time salary from respondent even though she was killed during concurrent part-time employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from a lower court (New Jersey), which convicted defendant of murder and arson and imposed a mandatory life sentence for the murder under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A: 113-3,4, as judicially altered. Defendant contended that the sentencing scheme violated his rights under the U.S. Const. amends. V, VI and the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon defendant's sentencing to life imprisonment for murder, the court granted certification limited to the issue of the validity of the mandatory life sentence upon a jury conviction for murder under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A: 113-3,4, as judicially altered. Defendant argued that a cited case invalidated the sentencing scheme because the difference in potential minimum sentences between that upon conviction after trial and that upon a plea of non vult infringed the U.S. Const. amend. V, impermissibly burdened the U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a jury trial, and denied equal protection to those defendants that went to trial. The court affirmed. The authority of the cited opinion was limited to a case of a choice between trial and plea of guilty when a possible consequence of the former, and only of the former, was the death penalty. Alternatively, any inducement to plead non vult and thereby to waive a right to trial was not an unnecessary device but a useful one and did not infringe on constitutional rights. Classification of offenders for purposes of fixing penalty were rationally related to proper legislative purposes and, therefore, defendant's equal protection claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commonwealth challenged an appellate court decision which reversed a trial court order compelling appellee attorney to testify before a grand jury. The appellate court based its decision upon the conclusion that the commonwealth did not need the information it was seeking from appellee. The commonwealth had admitted that it did not need the information for an indictment against the target, but wanted the testimony to assure a conviction. The commonwealth claimed that its evidence was hearsay and that it was within the discretionary powers of prosecution to elicit stronger evidence even if the hearsay would suffice to sustain an indictment, as distinguished from what would be required to make a prima facie case at trial. The court agreed and reversed the appellate division. The court found that the appellate court had found it unfair to order appellee to testify before the grand jury because appellee had been indicted for the same transaction. Appellee had full protection under the Witness Immunity Statute&nbsp;N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:81-17.3, so his constitutional right to remain silent was not violated by compelling him to testify against the target of the grand jury.</SPAN></P>

Although the information was not needed to secure an indictment, the commonwealth was properly exercising its discretionary power by seeking additional evidence to support its case against the target. Appellee, who was also indicted for the same transaction, had the protection of the Witness Immunity Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff municipality obtained a tax foreclosure judgment, barring all rights of redemption to defendant corporate landowner's property. Defendant sought to reopen that final judgment, on the grounds that the notice requirements of the In Rem Tax Foreclosure Act (Act), N. J. Stat. Ann &sect; 54:5-104.29 et seq., fell short of U.S. Const. amend. XIV procedural due process. The Act required only notice by publication and posting. The trial court and the appellate division rejected appellant's argument, but on appeal, the court agreed with appellant. The court held that the notice provisions of the Act were unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions, and it thus overruled City of Newark v. Yeskel, 5 N.J. 313 (1950), which upheld these procedures against similar constitutional objections. The court held that notice by publication was not constitutional in a foreclosure of tax delinquent premises where the municipality possessed the name and address of the owner but failed to give notice by mail or otherwise to that address.

The denial of defendant's motion to reopen the judgment on procedural grounds and because the In Rem Tax Foreclosure Act, N.J.S.A. 54:5-104.29 et seq. did not apply was affirmed on appeal. On review, defendant claimed that she was denied procedural due process under the Act because the statute required individual notice to taxpayers of record. Defendant also argued that the statute did not permit foreclosure of liens against property that was occupied. The court disagreed and affirmed the appellate court's order. The court noted that defendant was not listed as a record owner of the subject property and that notice was sent to all owners of record in compliance with the statute. Consequently, notice was provided in accordance with the statute. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the statute only authorized foreclosure of liens on vacant land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were charged with drug-related offenses and were denied admission to a pretrial intervention (PTI) program, an alternative to prosecution authorized under N.J.

In a prior ruling, the court reversed, holding that by precluding from consideration all defendants charged with heinous offenses, the county criteria for admission failed to conform to the rehabilitative purposes of N.J. Ct. R. 3:28. The court granted the Attorney General's motion to intervene for rehearing, especially to consider whether, in light of the doctrine of separation of powers, the court had the power to divert defendant over the prosecutor's objection. The court concluded that PTI fell within the practice and procedure over which the court had control through its rule-making powers. Rule 3:28 did not encroach upon the powers delegated to the legislative or executive branches of government. Judicial review over PTI was constitutionally authorized pursuant to the court's rule-making and adjudicatory powers. The scope of the court's review was properly limited to gross abuse of discretion by the prosecutor. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, county and officials, implemented an extended work day for probation officers without first conferring with plaintiff, bargaining unit for the officers.

The trial court found that the directive did not modify any existing rule governing working conditions under N.J. Stat.

The court held that while the issue was not negotiable pursuant to the constitution, plaintiff was entitled to urge that this position be changed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court in two murder cases entered orders preventing appellant newspapers from publishing any information about confessions made by the defendants and revealed during evidentiary hearings outside the presence of the juries, until the juries were sequestered to deliberate their verdicts. Appellants filed suit to challenge the orders, but the appellate court denied their appeal. Thereafter, appellants sought further review, arguing the orders were impermissible prior restraints. The reviewing court heard the matter because the issues were likely to recur and vacated the illegal orders. The court reasoned that newspapers have an absolute right or privilege to report events that transpire at a public court hearing. The court noted that the trial court could have used other means to insure that the juries did not have access to information about the confessions, such as sequestration, definitive instructions to not to read or listen to media reports of the trial and to decide the issues only on evidence presented in open court, or an in camera evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate division affirmed, holding that defendant New Jersey Turnpike Authority was a public entity within the meaning of the Tort Claims Act; therefore the provision of the Act barring subrogation actions, N.

The application for the variance was properly denied because there was no finding that without appellant's project, the general welfare inherent in the provision of more multi-family housing would not be attained. The court declined to resolve the knotty issue of whether such housing inherently benefitted the general welfare because respondent's findings in support of the variance denial were not arbitrary and were based on substantial evidence. The acceptance into evidence of the planning board's resolution disapproving the variance was commonplace procedure, and reasonable notice of it was given to appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent, a board of adjustment, that denied a zoning variance to appellant developer to build an apartment house in a restricted single-family zone and that held that the restrictive ordinance was valid. The ordinance preserving the character of the single-family residential community was a valid legislative judgment, and respondent's denial of the variance was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff developer sought review of a judgment from a lower court (New Jersey), which reversed a trial court's judgment holding that defendant township's zoning ordinance, limiting residential development to single-family lots, was invalid and which remanded the denial of plaintiff's application for a variance to build multi-family housing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff developer brought an action against defendant township challenging the denial of a variance to build multi-family housing and the validity of a zoning ordinance limiting residential development to single-family lots. The lower court reversed a judgment that the ordinance was invalid and that remanded the variance denial. On appeal, the court affirmed the validity of the zoning ordinance with a modification approving the trial court's judgment that an ordinance amendment increasing lot sizes was invalid. Plaintiff misplaced reliance on a cited case. The cited case involved a developing municipality, and defendant was a fully developed one. The cited case did not displace established principles disfavoring judicial intervention in local zoning decisions. The decision to keep the municipality free from multi-family development was not an arbitrary one. The general shortage of multi-family housing did not effectively amend the ordinance to require such housing. The requirement that all municipalities must zone for housing for all categories of the population, middle and upper classes as well as low and moderate income, was not applicable to a fully developed municipality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment setting aside the trial court adjudication of illegality of an ordinance for failure to zone for multi-family residential use and the remand of defendant township's denial of a variance to plaintiff developer to build multi-family housing. The court concluded that the zoning ordinance legitimately preserved the single-family character of defendant, a fully developed municipality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant borough enacted Fort Lee, N.J., Ordinance No. 72-1, a local rent control ordinance. Section 20 of the ordinance provided that it remained in effect for up to one year, but could be extended by the governing body by resolution extending said term from year to year. After defendant borough and officials extended the term for two consecutive years, plaintiff landlords filed suit against defendants, arguing that the ordinance could not be extended by resolution. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. On review, defendants argued that the trial court erred in finding that the governing body could not extend the ordinance by a resolution and that as a result the ordinance expired after the original one-year term. The court reversed the trial court judgment. The court ruled that &sect; 20 was invalid because reenactment of rent control legislation that initially was required to be enacted by ordinance could not be accomplished by resolution. However, the court ruled that &sect; 20 was properly severable from the remainder of the ordinance because without that section, rents would be regulated in the borough as long as the housing emergency continued.</SPAN></P>

The other driver was a New York resident. As required by the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-1 et seq., plaintiff's liability insurance policy included a personal injury protection clause (PIP). The PIP clause subrogated defendant insurer to plaintiff's rights against a third party and required plaintiff to reimburse defendant insurer from any recovery. The trial court held that the reimbursement clause was invalid, entered judgment for plaintiff, and awarded plaintiff counsel fees. On review, the court affirmed the fee award holding that N.J. Ct.

However, the court held that the reimbursement and subrogation provisions of plaintiff's policy were valid.

Appellee sought to deliver newspapers that were not received from the publisher until nearly midnight the previous evening. Subsequent to the charges, appellee brought an action challenging the ordinances and sought injunctive relief against their enforcement. A motion for summary judgment filed by appellee was granted by the trial court which held that the prohibition of newspaper deliveries on Sundays was an unconstitutional infringement of the freedom of the press and that the Sunday driving ban was a violation of the guaranty of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Upon review, the court essentially held that any attempt to restrict the freedom of the press had to be justified by a clear public interest. It was an undue restriction of the press to prohibit Sunday delivery when the result would be no paper delivery at all on Sundays. The judgment of the trial court was modified with an order stating that the ordinances, though not invalid, could not be enforced with respect to appellee's Sunday paper delivery service.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was required to amend the ordinance, which it did in 1973. Thereafter, the trial court invalidated the 1973 amendment. Prior to adopting the 1970 ordinance, the township declared a moratorium on residential construction other than owner-occupied single family dwellings while the adoption of a new master plan and zoning ordinance was pending. A claim challenging the moratorium resulted in a deadline for submitting the master plan and adopting the new zoning ordinance. The result was the 1970 ordinance which failed to provide for low-cost housing needs. In determining that the 1973 ordinance was also invalid, the trial court found that the ordinance did not provide the opportunity to meet a fair share of the regional burden for low and moderate income housing needs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, Director of the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights (director) and potential firefighter, challenged an order of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), that held that appellant director exceeded his statutory power and violated the discrimination principles of N.J. Const. art. I, para. 5 and the Law Against Discrimination, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 et seq., when he adopted a discriminatory quota regime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant potential firefighter (&quot;firefighter&quot;) was denied a firefighting position because he failed a written test and commenced suit against respondents, town, mayor, and commissioners. Appellant firefighter alleged that the testing and selecting procedures were fair in form but discriminatory in operation against blacks. Appellant Director of the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights (director) found for appellant firefighter and ordered respondents to reevaluate all black applicants in accordance with non-discriminatory standards and to promote one qualified black applicant for every one qualified white applicant. The appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that appellant director's order was violative of N.J. Const. art. I, para. 5 and was beyond the power entrusted to appellant director under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-17. The court reasoned that to rectify the wrongs of the past by a method of racial quotas defeated the very purpose of the Law Against Discrimination, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court because appellant Director of the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights exceeded his statutory power and violated both New Jersey law and the New Jersey Constitution when it set up a discriminatory quota regime to alleviate alleged past discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed his convictions for possession of marijuana with intent to manufacture and distribute, maintaining premises resorted to by persons for the purpose of unlawful manufacture and distribution of marijuana, and possession of a dangerous knife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to manufacture and distribute, maintaining premises resorted to by persons for the purpose of unlawful manufacture and distribution of marijuana, and possession of a dangerous knife. The court below affirmed those convictions, and defendant appealed. The court held that a judge's failure to record or summarize a police officer's oral comments given at the time he sought a search warrant for defendant's home made the subsequent testimony by the officer at the suppression hearing unreliable and inadmissible. The court also held that the officer's affidavit in support of the warrant was insufficient to show probable cause. The court found, however, that the discovery of a weapon on defendant resulted from a search incident to a lawful arrest, and was not unlawfully connected to the illegal search of defendant's home. The court reversed the convictions for possession with intent to manufacture and distribute marijuana, and of maintaining premises resorted to by persons for the purpose of unlawful manufacture and distribution of marijuana, and the judgment of conviction for possession of a dangerous knife was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower court's judgment affirming defendant's convictions for drug offenses because the trial court had erred in admitting evidence and testimony by a police officer regarding the evidence. The court affirmed the conviction for possession of a dangerous knife because the knife was found while searching defendant incident to a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner claimant sought review of a judgment of the Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed an award in favor of petitioner by the compensation court in petitioner's claim for occupational hearing loss, filed six years after retiring from his employment with respondent corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner claimant filed a claim for occupational hearing loss six years after retiring from his employment with respondent corporation. As the Workmen's Compensation Act (the act) was then written, this time span exceeded the permissible period within which such a claim was required to be filed. Two months before his claim was heard, however, a statutory amendment abrogated the time limitation. The compensation court ruled that petitioner was entitled to prevail because the claim came within the statutory amendment. The appellate court reversed, holding that the amendment should only be given prospective application. The petitioner appealed. The court reversed the appellate court and reinstated the judgement of the compensation court, holding that that statutory amendment to the act had to be interpreted retroactively to allow claims to be filed within two years of discovery of the nature of a disability. The court rejected respondent's argument that giving the act a retrospective interpretation trampled its vested right to impose the bar of the earlier time limitation, noting that the defense related to the compensation court's lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and reinstated the judgment of the compensation court. The court held that the amendment to the Workmen's Compensation Act would be applied retroactively to cover the claim of petitioner claimant, who filed his claim for occupational hearing loss six years after retiring from his employment with respondent corporation, but within one month of discovering that the impairment was work-related.</SPAN></P>
