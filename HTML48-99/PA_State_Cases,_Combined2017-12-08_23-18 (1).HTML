</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant advertising company sought review, in consolidated appeals, of decisions of the Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the preliminary objections of appellees, municipalities, and dismissed appellant's complaints in mandamus and actions for declaratory relief from appellees' ordinances limiting appellant's outdoor advertising.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant advertising company sought permission from appellees, municipalities, to put up billboards. Appellant filed substantive validity challenges to appellees' ordinances and requests for curative amendments. After hearings, the validity challenges were granted and curative amendments were adopted by both appellees. Appellees denied permits, and appellant brought actions at law and for equitable and declaratory relief. The trial court sustained appellees' preliminary objections and dismissed the equity actions, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's decisions. The court stated that after a successful validity challenge, a governing body could not totally prohibit the successful challenger's proposed development nor subject it to unreasonable and burdensome restrictions, but it could subject the plans to reasonable restrictions as might be otherwise provided for in its ordinance. As a result, the court stated that appellant's right to site specific relief was not clear without a determination as to what restrictions applied, making mandamus inappropriate. The court also found that the applicable statute made declaratory relief unavailable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order sustaining preliminary objections of appellees, municipalities, to appellant advertising company's actions seeking mandamus and declaratory relief against appellees' denial of appellant's request to install billboards, because the restrictions on appellant's plans available to appellees were an issue for the trial court and declaratory relief was unavailable by the terms of the applicable statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance company sought review of respondent insurance commissioner's final order disapproving rate modifications for four policy forms for guaranteed renewable policies. Respondent issued a written disapproval 85 days after petitioner's submission and petitioner requested a hearing. Respondent issued its final order based on its findings that Pennsylvania's lower than national average rates should have been a factor in setting petitioner's rates. The court held that renewal of an insurance policy at different premiums created new contracts; therefore, respondent had authority to approve or disapprove renewal premiums under the Insurance Company Law of 1921, 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 751. The court also held that under 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 477b, petitioner's rates were approved as a matter of law after 60 days had passed without a determination from respondent. However, the rates became void upon disapproval thereof. The court reversed with respect to respondent's holding that petitioner's rate filings were not approved by operation of law and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sign owners challenged the validity of &sect; 140-90 as an unconstitutional taking. Appellee zoning hearing board found that pre-existing, nonconforming signs would continue to exist until the amendment's effective date. Appellee board denied appellants' application as not ripe for review because there was no present restriction on the use of appellants' signs. The trial court affirmed. Appellants sought review. The court reversed and remanded for consideration of the substantive issues that were raised by appellants and adequately developed for review. The court held that &sect; 140-90, as of its effective date, had been applied to appellants as owners of nonconforming structures. The court found that appellants would suffer hardship if judicial consideration was delayed because they were subject to civil penalties for failure to comply and the expenses of applying for a special exception or modifying, replacing, or removing the signs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a pro se litigant, challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed appellant's complaint against appellees, three county district judges, with prejudice. Appellant argued that because appellees had not filed notices of acceptance under &sect; 1 of the Act of April 13, 1859, P.L. 592, they were occupying their offices illegally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a pro se litigant, filed a complaint against appellees, three county district judges. The complaint alleged that appellees held office illegally because under &sect; 1 of the Act of April 13, 1859, P.L. 592 (Act 577), they were required to file notices of acceptance, which they had not done. Appellant simultaneously filed a petition for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP). The lower court dismissed the complaint as frivolous because Act 577 had been repealed by the Act of April 22, 1909, P.L. 104 (Act 63). Appellant argued that Act 63 did not repeal Act 577 and that failure to rule on the IFP petition within 20 days violated Pa. R. Civ. P. 240. The court first examined Pa. R. Civ. P. 240(j), which allowed a court to dismiss an action before acting on the IFP petition if the action was frivolous. Appellant's complaint was grounded in repealed law. The complaint was frivolous. Therefore, dismissal of the complaint and the IFP petition was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the lower court dismissing the complaint. The requirement that appellees, three county district judges, file notices of acceptance was contained in a statute that was repealed in 1909. Because appellant pro se litigant's complaint was frivolous, dismissal of the in forma pauperis petition was also proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cat owner kept 25 cats in her home. The trial court issued a summary conviction for violation of Borough of Carnegie Ordinance No. 1089, which limited the number of cats or dogs which a person could keep to five. On appeal, the court vacated the conviction. The court held that the borough had the authority to pass ordinances relating to ownership of pets under 53 P.S. &sect; 46202(13) (repealed), and to nuisances in general under 53 P.S. &sect; 46202(5), (6), and (74) (repealed). The court held that appellant could not challenge the ordinance's enactment, as the time for doing so under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5571(c)(5) had expired. The court held that the borough had not established that the ordinance was a reasonable means of achieving a legitimate governmental goal, as it did not indicate why more than five dogs or cats would constitute a nuisance or risk to public health and safety. The court noted that the trial court made no finding that appellant's cats were a nuisance in fact. The court remanded for the trial court to determine what goals the borough sought to achieve, whether they were legitimate governmental goals, and whether the means used were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer who challenged the validity of a zoning ordinance on the basis that it was unconstitutional sought review of an order that affirmed a decision that denied appellant's curative amendment that challenged the zoning ordinance. The issue presented on appeal was whether the board erred in determining that the zoning ordinance did not unconstitutionally exclude or fail to provide for a fair share of mobile home park development in the township. The court concluded that the township's failure to provide for mobile home park development effectively prohibited the use. The court reasoned that because the township provided no justification for completely prohibiting the use, the zoning ordinance unconstitutionally excluded mobile home parks. The court also held that the trial court was best situated to determine the extent to which appellant's proposal should have been approved. The order was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the board's objections, holding that petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, which resulted in a lack of jurisdiction. The board's decision to immediately suspend petitioner's license, based on a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence, was prosecutorial in nature, rather than adjudicatory. Under &sect; 41 of the Act, 63 P.S. &sect; 422.41, those board members who participated in the decision to prosecute petitioner were precluded from adjudicating the charges against him. Therefore, the remaining untainted board member's decision was considered the final adjudication. Further, because petitioner had an adequate administrative remedy, he had the opportunity to challenge the authority of the prosecuting attorney to press additional charges before the board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver was charged, pled guilty to, and was sentenced on January 29, 1991 for fraudulently obtaining prescription narcotics.

On September 10, 1991, respondent sent appellant a notice of the suspension of her operating privileges. Appellant sought review of the suspension in the trial court. The trial court affirmed the suspension of appellant's license and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(m) met substantive due process constitutional requirements because the operation of a motor vehicle was not a property right but a privilege and determined that &sect; 780-113(m) was rationally related to promote the legitimate state interest of deterring illegal drug use. The court also held that &sect; 780-113(m) met equal protection safeguards because it imposed mandatory and uniform penalties on licensees convicted of certain drug offenses. The court found that appellant was not entitled to vacation of the suspension due to unreasonable delay because the delay was caused by the judicial system and not by respondent.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Senate, including the challenged senator, voted to permit the challenged senator to participate and to be seated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, retail bakers, challenged their classification as an eating establishment and the six percent sales tax which accompanied it. Petitioners sought to classify themselves with wholesale bakers to take advantage of tax exemptions available to wholesale bakers. The court had dismissed their request for declaratory judgment and dismissed their petition for review. Petitioner filed for post trial relief, and the court denied the petition. The court found that wholesale bakers generally employed far more people than retail bakers and were subject to inducements such as tax-exempt status to relocate within Pennsylvania. The classification in this case did not violate the uniformity clause of the Pa. Const. or the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend XIV because there was a legitimate distinction between wholesale and retail bakers. The distinction between wholesale and retail provided a nonarbitrary, reasonable, and just basis to grant a processing exclusion for sales and use tax to wholesale and not retail bakers because it sought to encourage wholesale bakers to relocate within Pennsylvania, thus providing jobs and tax revenues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner retail bakers' motion for post trial relief and affirmed its decision to deny petitioners' request for declaratory judgment and to deny their petition for review. The court found that the taxing classification challenged by petitioners was based upon a legitimate distinction which showed a nonarbitrary, reasonable, and just basis for the grant of a processing exclusion to wholesale and not retail bakers.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, city and gas works management corporation, intervened. The trial court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that defendant commission did not violate the Sunshine Act, that a city ordinance which required that the base rate be calculated to include a fixed annual payment to defendant city was not unconstitutional, and that defendant commission erred in reducing defendant gas works' rate relief for implementation of a cost-saving measure. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that plaintiffs did not establish that defendant commission held non-public deliberations before the public meeting on the rate increase in violation of the Sunshine Act. The court remanded for recalculation of the rate increase without the fixed payment to defendant city because it found that the fixed amount was arbitrary in that it did not represent a fair return on defendant city's investment in defendant gas works and because there was no relationship between the amount and benefits conferred on rate payers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Transportation challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which sustained appellee landowners' preliminary objections to a declaration of taking filed by appellant to acquire the fee title underlying the easement for highway purposes previously acquired by appellant in the subject property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Transportation had acquired a highway easement on appellee landowners' land. Appellant did not improve the land. Appellant sought a declaration of taking seeking to acquire the underlying fee with respect to the property, and appellees resisted. The lower court sustained appellees' preliminary objections to the taking, holding that, because appellant did not seek the taking for highway use, the taking was improper, and appellant sought review. The court reversed the lower court's decision. The court held that 71 P.S. &sect; 513(e) allowed appellant more rights than merely an easement in the land and that a taking need not have been solely for highway purposes. Because appellees did not allege that appellant formally vacated the easement in their land, the lower court was not permitted to ignore the controlling case law to find that appellant abandoned its rights in the property. The decision not to construct the originally envisioned structures did not constitute the formal vacation of the easement in the manner required by law. The court held that an abandonment of the easement did not occur because appellant never formally vacated the easement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that appellant Department of Transportation's declaration of the taking of the underlying fee was valid and reversed the order sustaining appellee landowners' preliminary objections and remanded the case for further proceedings. The taking was valid because appellant was not required to use easement for highway purposes and had never formally abandoned its easement.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that the ordinance did not violate appellants' equal protection rights because it was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, and that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided fair notice to appellants. Lastly, the court held that the ordinance was not an unconstitutional partial exclusion of a particular type of use given that appellants failed to meet their burden of proving that there was a lack of &quot;fair share&quot; of a particular type of zoning.</SPAN></P>

The court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, holding that the uncontroverted evidence established that the UIPA, which, on its face vested both prosecutorial and adjudicative functions in respondent department, was constitutional because there was no impermissible commingling where, in practice, a wall of division between the insurance commissioner, the adjudicator, and the prosecutor existed. The court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, and denied petitioners' request for mandamus, holding that respondents' holding of petitioners' license applications pending the outcome of the enforcement action did not violate petitioners' due process rights because petitioners did not have a protected property interest in a license which did not yet exist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Dauphin County (Pennsylvania), which granted declaratory relief to appellee, holding that appellants' imposition of a 10 percent amusement tax violated 53 P.S. &sect; 6908(10) and the Pennsylvania Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee operated a miniature golf course. Appellants sought to impose an amusement tax on appellee's facility under a township ordinance imposing an amusements tax. Appellee asserted that the tax violated the Local Tax Enabling Act (Act), 53 P.S. &sect; 6908, which provided for limitations on the amount of tax imposed by political subdivisions on golf courses. Appellee sought declaratory relief, seeking to invalidate imposition of the amusement tax under the ordinance. The trial court held that the amusement tax, as applied to appellee, violated Section 8(10) of the Act, 53 P.S. 6908(10), as well as Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. On appeal, the court reversed. It found that appellants had the authority to impose such an amusement tax on miniature golf courses, as they were distinct from and not included within the meaning of golf courses under &sect; 6908(10). Appellee failed to meet its burden of proving there was no distinction between golf courses and miniature golf courses.

Seeking review, appellant claimed he was not required to pursue his administrative remedies because he presented a substantial question of constitutionality so that the trial court should have exercised its equitable jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7531-7541. The court noted that appellant only claimed that &quot;as applied,&quot; the tax was unconstitutional, which was insufficient to invoke equity jurisdiction. Because appellant's complaint did not set forth a substantial constitutional question, the trial court did not err in refusing to exercise its equity jurisdiction to decide the case under the act. The trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court reversed the factual findings with regard to petitioner municipal authority board members' conduct concerning the North Huntingdon Township Municipal Authority.

Nevertheless, the court then reversed with respect to the conclusion that petitioners' actions as Western Westmoreland Municipal Authority members had violated Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 65, &sect; 403(a). The court noted that petitioners had done more than just vote on their officer election and salaries; petitioners had created officer positions specifically to circumvent the Pa. Stat.

The remaining information in the applications did not implicate the same concerns and was not protected from disclosure. The court reversed the order that restricted retroactive disclosure to names only because even though existing license holders had no notice that their information would be subject to disclosure, they were not deprived of any right due to the fact that address and telephone and social security numbers were exempt from disclosure under the Act's personal security exception.</SPAN></P>

While the court was permitted, under Pa. R. App. P. 1551(a)(1), to consider a challenge to the facial validity of a statute even when that question was not previously raised before the governmental unit, petitioner had failed to include the issue in his petition for review. The court further held that petitioner failed to properly preserve his second argument for appeal. The court held that Pa. R. App. P. 1551(a)(3) was not applicable because the &quot;commingling-of-functions&quot; issue could have been raised before respondent prior to its adjudication and, therefore, petitioner failed to exercise due diligence under the rule. Moreover, the case relied upon by petitioner merely reaffirmed the constitutional requirement that, where both prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions reposed in a single administrative agency, walls of division had to be constructed to eliminate the threat or appearance of bias, and did not establish any new legal principle nor overrule past precedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent candidate sought and won the Republican Party nomination for common pleas court judge and the Democratic Party filed a substitute nomination certificate, substituting respondent as the Democratic candidate for that position. Petitioner objectors filed a petition objecting to and seeking to set aside the substitute nomination certificate. The court dismissed the petition because under section 981.1 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. &sect; 2949.1, a candidate for common pleas court judge was exempt from the prohibition in section 979 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. &sect; 2939, against the substitute nomination by a political party of a candidate who was already nominated by any other political party for the same office. The court also granted respondent's motion to dismiss the objection petition as untimely because petitioners filed the objection petition within three days after the substitute nomination certificate was filed, but did not serve the Bureau of Elections within three days. The court found that the three-day limit of 25 P.S. &sect; 2942 applied to both filing and service and that the seven-day period found in 25 P.S. &sect; 2937 did not apply to service, as petitioners argued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition because respondent candidate, a nominee for a position on the court of common pleas, was not subject to the statute prohibiting a person already nominated by one political party from being nominated as a substitute candidate by another political party for the same office and granted respondent's motion to dismiss because petitioner objectors did not timely perfect their objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, health care services company and individual doctors and psychiatrists, were awarded a contract by respondent department of corrections to provide health care services to inmates. Following an inmate death, respondent notified petitioners that they were being suspended and that respondent was contemplating their debarment, which would preclude them from further contracting with state agencies. Petitioners filed suit challenging the implementation of contractor suspension and debarment. Respondent filed preliminary objections, asserting that petitioners failed to state a cognizable cause of action and failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. In overruling respondent's preliminary objections, the court concluded that petitioners presented a valid constitutional claim. Where the official who would sit in judgment on the debarment proceedings was the same official who issued the notice of suspension, the potential for bias and the appearance of non-objectivity created a fatal constitutional defect. Where the remedy itself was constitutionally flawed, it would be futile to require petitioners to exhaust that remedy before seeking judicial review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After suffering seizures, appellee driver licensees had their operating privileges suspended by appellant department of transportation under the provisions of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1519(c). The trial court sustained appeals brought by appellees. The trial court determined that the regulation upon which appellant based the suspensions, 62 Pa. Code &sect; 83.4, was substantively unreasonable and offensive to epileptic licensees' procedural due process rights. The court affirmed, finding that operating privileges constituted a constitutionally protected property interest which appellant could not terminate without providing due process protection. The court found that the suspension of issued licenses involved state action that adjudicated important interests of appellees and, thus, licenses could not be taken away without the procedural due process required by U.S. Const. amend IV. Additionally, the court found that the regulations, by creating a presumption of incompetence, denied appellees an opportunity to present evidence rebutting the presumption of incompetence. The court found no paramount state justification for curtailing appellees' procedural rights.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner appealed and contended that respondent erred in its interpretation and argued that the statute merely prohibited respondent from denying an application for a milk dealer's license if that applicant was licensed as a milk dealer as of the effective date. The court agreed and reversed the order. The court held that respondent's interpretation of the statute would lead to an absurd and unreasonable result, since the passage of time would extinguish the pool of applicant's and leave the state without milk dealers.

Petitioner challenged the validity of certain sections of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa. Cons.

The law and associated regulations set caps on insurance reimbursements under the law and established peer review to determine the reasonableness and necessity of treatment under the act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee natural gas company commenced eminent domain proceedings pursuant to 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. 1511(g), after unsuccessfully negotiating with appellants, property owners, to secure an easement for the gas distribution line along the boundary of appellants' property. The trial court granted a writ of possession to appellee for the easement and appellants sought review. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and held that 15 Pa. Cons. Stat.

Appellants failed to prove that the condemnation was arbitrary and capricious; they only proved that other alternatives existed. The court concluded that no matter who currently owned the property or if a private company also benefitted from the construction, a gas line servicing a public prison facility served a public purpose. Therefore, the taking by eminent domain did not lose its public character merely because there may have existed therein some feature of private gain. If the public good was enhanced, it was immaterial that a private interest was also benefitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city brought a class action in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania against respondent Pennsylvania Department of Revenue that sought a declaratory judgment and mandamus relief. Petitioner filed a motion for partial judgment on its pleadings to declare invalid an administrative regulation promulgated by respondent under the Public Utility Realty Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 8101-A -- 8108-A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city commenced a class action in the court against respondent Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, which requested a declaratory judgment to invalidate an administrative regulation promulgated by respondent, along with mandamus relief. The court denied petitioner's motion for partial judgment on the pleadings because respondent's regulation of 61 Pa. Code &sect; 159.1(b) was neither invalid or unconstitutional. The court held that petitioner could proceed with its mandamus action to compel respondent to conduct its statutory obligations under the Public Utility Realty Tax Act, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 8101-A -- 8108-A. The court determined that the regulation did not prevent petitioner or the class members from bringing an action before the court to compel respondent to perform its statutory obligations. Thus, the court upheld the regulation because it reflected the legislative decision to not establish an administrative or statutory remedy to local taxing authorities that sought timely and proper distribution of collected real estate taxes. The court considered this legislative decision to be appropriate because respondent's only responsibility for distribution was simply administrative.</SPAN></P>

The Act's application to the courts was constitutional to the extent that judges retained supervisory control over their personnel. The courts remained able to take proper steps to maintain independence. The court sustained the demurrers to petitioners' second count because the relevant authorities invalidated the Sunset Act, which allowed respondent to exist and hence its actions were not null and void.

The court also affirmed the trial court's finding that defendant's selective enforcement of the Resolution had violated plaintiff's rights under the Equal Protection Clause. The court also affirmed the trial court's order requiring defendant to pay monies that were incorrectly assessed against plaintiff into an account for plaintiff and to pay plaintiff's counsel fees.

The court held that the take-out provision was not unconstitutional under federal or state law because it did not involve state action. The court sustained respondent's finding of an insufficient nexus between the plan and the commonwealth and held that the commonwealth's pervasive regulation of the plan did not make the plan's actions into &quot;state actions.&quot; The cooperation between the commonwealth and the plan, the alleged &quot;adoption&quot; of the plan by the Department of Insurance, and the approval of the plan by respondent were insufficient grounds for finding that the plan was a state actor whose conduct had to comport with constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected petitioners' contentions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Environmental Quality Board (EQB) designated property owned by petitioners, coal company and coal owners, as unsuitable for surface mining pursuant to &sect; 4.5(b) of the Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act (PaSMCRA), 52 P.S. &sect; 1396.4e(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner legislators and respondent retirement system filed cross-motions for summary judgment in an action for declaratory judgment that amendments to the State Employees' Retirement Code of 1974, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5101 et seq., which eliminated a compensation option to receive better pension benefits for new legislators, denied petitioners equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner legislators were eligible for pension benefits that were less attractive than benefits for incumbent legislators because of changes made to the State Employees' Retirement Code of 1974, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5101 et seq., before petitioners took office. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the court upheld the law because there was no equal protection violation under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, Pa. Const.&nbsp;art. III, &sect; 32, or under existing case law. The legislation did not change existing contractual rights, the new legislators were not members of a suspect class, and the receipt of benefits did not implicate a liberty interest. The legislation was rational because it averted a pension fund shortfall. The court held that petitioners were not entitled to the same protection that the law afforded the judiciary from legislative interference. The court found that, unlike the situation where the legislature might use funding to control a separate branch of government, which could violate the separation of powers and Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(a), the pension problem arose from the legislature itself, not as a threat by another branch of government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner legislators' motion for summary judgment and granted respondent retirement system's motion for summary judgment because there was no equal protection violation absent interference with an existing contact, a suspect class, or a fundamental liberty interest; and, provisions that dealt with the separation of powers did not apply because the legislature was dealing with its own compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff medical society filed an action to declare 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1797, a provision of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law that restricted charges and billing for automobile accident medical treatment, unconstitutional as violative of physicians' due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art I, &sect; 1, and because it was vague and overbroad. The court considered cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff medical society challenged the constitutionality of 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1797, a provision of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law that restricted charges to insurers of automobile accident victims to a percentage of the Medicare payments and also prohibited billing the patient any shortfall. The court granted respondent commissioner's motion for summary judgment. The court held that &sect; 1797(a) did not violate physicians' due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Pa. Const. art I, &sect; 1 because the state had a legitimate interest in regulating automobile insurance. In addition, &sect; 1797(a) had a rational relationship to achieving that goal by restricting fees charged insurers, as well as preventing a shifting of the burden from the insurer to the insured for the shortfall. The court further held that respondent's interpretation of &sect; 1797(a) was in accordance with the court's interpretation and was not clearly erroneous. The court also found that 31 Pa. Code &sect; 69.22, a regulation adopted during the litigation, had eviscerated any contention regarding the purported unconstitutional vagueness of the direct patient billing prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the summary judgment motion of plaintiff medical society, granted the cross-motion of respondent insurance commissioner, and dismissed the case. The court held that motor vehicle insurance regulation was a legitimate state interest, and the statute was rationally related to that interest and to the avoidance of cost shifting. The court held that respondent's regulations cured any vagueness deficiencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner legislator appealed the order of the State Agency, State Employees' Retirement Board (Pennsylvania), which rejected his request to receive higher pension benefits. The board held that petitioner, who served as a legislator prior to amendments to the State Employees' Retirement Code of 1974, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5101, et seq., but was not in office at the time of the amendments, would receive reduced benefits for later terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner legislator had served, but was out of office and receiving pension benefits, when the legislature amended the state pension system under the State Employee's Retirement Code of 1974, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. 5101, et seq., to provide lower pension benefits to new legislators. Petitioner later took office again and served under the changed system. When he retired, he sought to be classified with legislators who had taken office under the old system. Respondent retirement board, while not disturbing his former pension rights, ordered that the pension for his later service be based on membership in the class of new legislators. On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that the two-tier system did not violate the equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and Pa Const. art. III, &sect; 32, because the system was rationally related to restoring fiscal soundness to the system. The court held that petitioner's vested contract rights had not been unconstitutionally impaired because the two separate segments of service, one before and one after the amendments, constituted two separate employment contracts and two separate sets of pension rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of respondent retirement board that gave petitioner legislator a lower pension for later service after changes to the pension system because the two-tier retirement system for legislators did not deny petitioner equal protection under either the federal or state constitutions, and petitioner's two periods of employment involved two distinct employment contracts and two distinct sets of pension rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant farmer challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Jefferson County (Pennsylvania), which denied his motion in arrest of judgment and upheld the guilty verdict against him for a violation of the Game and Wildlife Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant farmer killed a deer that was destroying his crops and reported the killing as required by the Game and Wildlife Code. Defendant was cited by a wildlife control officer for unlawfully failing to care for the carcass under 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2125 and found guilty of failure or neglect to care for the carcass, or any part thereof, of any game or wildlife other than raccoons under 34 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2126(a)(5). On appeal, the court reversed, and found that it was required to strictly construe penal provisions by 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1928(b). The court found that the term &quot;care for a carcass&quot; was not defined, and there was no basis for linking failing to care under &sect; 2126(a)(5) with the removal of entrails in &sect; 2125 because there were no shared, parallel, or referenced terms between the sections, and there were indications that failure to care was something other than failure to remove entrails. The court, therefore, concluded that defendant's conviction was improper. The court, therefore, determined that it needed not reach defendant's constitutional challenge of &sect; 2126(a)(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant farmer's conviction for violation of the Game and Wildlife Code was reversed by the court because under the required strict interpretation of statutory penal provisions, there was no reason to link failure to care with the removal of entrails of deer killed by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowners applied for a permit to fill wetlands on their property for the purpose of constructing an auto repair shop. The Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board upheld the denial of petitioners' permit. The court affirmed the decision, and held that there was no unconstitutional taking. The court found that petitioners did not prove that their land was valueless after the permit denial. The court held that although petitioners might have been prevented from the most profitable use of their property, reduction in value was not enough to find a taking. The court found that the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, 32 P.S. &sect; 693.1-.27, and the Department of Environmental Resources' regulations did not prohibit the filling of wetlands, nor did the permit denial prohibit all construction on petitioners' land. The court held that petitioners' reasonable investment-backed expectations were not frustrated to the point that effected a taking of their property. The court found that petitioners did not offer any evidence about the economic value of their land that could be realized through other development options.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctor sought review of a decision of the Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine, which denied his motion to dismiss or suspend disciplinary proceedings pending against him. Petitioner contended that respondent board could not prosecute and adjudicate his case, and that his due process rights were violated by a failure to provide information through discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent board authorized formal discipline action against petitioner doctor. It charged him with multiple counts of unprofessional conduct. Petitioner filed an answer to the complaint and a motion to dismiss in which he alleged that respondent could not be both the prosecutor and the adjudicator in his case. Respondent affirmed a hearing examiner decision to overrule that motion, then decided that a court should decide if it could adjudicate the case. The court granted permission for petitioner to appeal respondent's certified interlocutory order. The court concluded that respondent was not required to have a completely separate body render the final adjudication in the case, as long as respondent excluded, in the final stages of the proceedings, members who performed prosecutorial functions. The court also held that petitioner's due process rights were not violated by a letter that informed him that there was no formal discovery in an administrative proceeding, but that it would comply with most of petitioner's requests at a pre-hearing conference. The case was remanded to respondent for final adjudication in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a complaint from an employee, respondent Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission ordered petitioner State Employees' Retirement Board to cease and desist discriminating based on age against employees who applied for disability insurance.

Petitioner appealed the Board's judgment, and argued that 77 P.S. &sect; 562, which discontinued death benefits if the surviving spouse entered into a meretricious relationship with another, was unconstitutional because it violated her privacy, equal protection and due process rights and operated as a bill of attainder. The court affirmed the Board's decision. The court held that no suspect group was created by &sect; 562 and no privacy interest was violated by that statute. The court held that the state had a rational basis for the statute, which was to encourage legally recognized relationships. The court held that the statute does not operate as a bill of attainder. The court held that the Board properly analyzed the economic impact to petitioner of discontinuing the death benefits.</SPAN></P>

Appellees, state, police commissioner, and police officers, filed a demurrer which asserted sovereign immunity and failure to state a cause of action, which was granted and resulted in the dismissal of appellant's suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an insurance company and real estate corporation, sought review of the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), which granted summary judgment to appellees, the city and its revenue commissioner, for payment of delinquent realty transfer taxes, because appellants claimed the Philadelphia Realty Transfer Tax Ordinance was invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an insurance company and real estate corporation, failed to file a certificate of transfer on a real estate transaction which occurred outside the city of Philadelphia as required by the Bill No. 567 amendment to Phila., Pa., Code &sect; 19-1403 and claimed that the imposition of such a tax violated the Sterling Act, 53 P.S. &sect; 15971 and was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to appellants. Appellees, the city and its revenue commissioner, sought payment of the delinquent transfer tax and, on appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees. The transfer of stock of a real estate corporation constituted a transfer of the interests in the property held by the corporation and was, therefore, properly taxed by appellees. The court held that Bill No. 567 did not classify the subjects of taxation uniformly as required by Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, but that the offending &quot;more than one percent&quot; provision could be severed without subverting or ignoring the express intent of the city council to tax all such realty transfers. The imposition of a transfer tax on real estate corporations was held constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to appellees, the city and its revenue commissioner, because appellants, an insurance company and real estate corporation, were proper subjects for realty transfer taxation because the city ordinance was constitutionally applied to transfers of city real estate even where actual transfer occurred elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant appealed an order of respondent Public School Employees' Retirement Board (Pennsylvania), which rejected the proposed report of a hearing examiner who suggested ruling in favor of claimant on appeal from a decision of the Pennsylvania State Employee's Retirement System, which refused to consider a payment of $ 14,854.08 made to claimant as compensation for retirement purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In anticipation of his retirement, petitioner claimant entered into an agreement with his employing school district that allowed him to work a reduced schedule for full-time pay. In addition, the school district agreed to pay petitioner $ 14,854.08 to purchase retirement credit for his military service, which the retirement system concluded was a severance payment and excluded in calculating petitioner's final average salary. He appealed, arguing that circumstances did not allow him to receive the benefit of the agreement, and hence the school district characterized the payment as compensation for his after-hour negotiation work in addition to full-time service as personnel director. Respondent Public School Employees' Retirement Board rejected its hearing examiner's recommendation to include the payment in calculating petitioner's final average salary, and concluded that the money was a severance payment. The court affirmed, holding that even if petitioner was not paid pursuant to the written agreement, the payment made was not part of his regular salary. The court held that respondent correctly found it was severance payment, and in doing so, did not deny petitioner due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of respondent Public School Employees' Retirement Board, holding that its review of the record indicated that respondent did not deprive petitioner of procedural due process. The court affirmed the board's order, finding that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the board's findings, which supported the conclusion of law that the claimant received a severance payment in the amount of $ 14,854.08.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner sought review of an order of the Environmental Hearing Board (Pennsylvania), which sustained in part and dismissed in part petitioner's appeal from an order of respondent Department of Environmental Resources that required petitioner to control erosion and sedimentation at his 67-acre site in Concord Township. Petitioner's primary argument was that several of respondent's findings were not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner engaged in earth removal work on his 67-acre site under an agreement with the township limiting such activities to 18 acres and providing for erosion and sedimentation control. When petitioner failed to comply, the township revoked the agreement and directed him to cease and desist from earth moving activities. At the state level, three different bureaus of respondent Department of Environmental Resources charged petitioner with violating several environmental laws. He argued that the cease and desist order barred him from implementing erosion and sedimentation controls. Respondent ordered petitioner to cease all activities except erosion and sedimentation control measures to comply with lawful orders; to file an erosion and sedimentation control remedial plan; and to file a complete permit application. Respondent's order was affirmed by the review board, which specifically rejected petitioner's complaint that site remediation was impeded by the involvement of three separate bureaus. The court affirmed, holding that there was substantial evidence in the record in support each of respondent's challenged findings. The court also denied respondent's bill of costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the board's administrative decision, which sustained in part and dismissed in part petitioner landowner's appeal from the order of respondent Department of Environmental Resources. The court also denied the bill of costs submitted by respondent for the court's consideration, holding that respondent failed to advance the costs claimed for supplementing the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner union challenged the orders of respondent Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, which dismissed petitioner's exceptions to respondent's decision that it lacked jurisdiction over unfair labor practice charges filed by petitioner against an employer, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Respondent brought claims under the Public Employe Relations Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect;&sect; 1101.101 to 1101.2301.</SPAN></P>

Respondent Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board declined jurisdiction pursuant to the doctrine of separation of powers and dismissed the charges. Petitioner appealed, and the court reversed. Initially, the court concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 763. On the merits, the court concluded that the employees must be given a forum in which to vindicate their rights and that respondent's assumption of jurisdiction did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers. Respondent was the only forum which entertained unfair labor practices charges, and failing to accept jurisdiction would eliminate the employees' rights under Act 195. Also, Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, provided that a remedy must exist for every right. Providing the employees with the right to organize was illusory without the corresponding right to a forum in which they could be heard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The state driver's license bureau notified defendant that as a consequence of his convictions for violations of 35 Pa. Cons.

Defendant appealed the suspensions to the trial court arguing that because there was no showing that a vehicle was used or employed in any way during the commission of the crimes, that 35 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 13(m) was unconstitutional as it constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated the separation of powers doctrine and notions of due process under the federal and state constitutions. The court affirmed the decision, finding defendant's constitutional attack on the mandatory penalty provisions of &sect; 13(m) constituted a collateral attack of the criminal proceedings to which he pled guilty and was, therefore, beyond the court's limited scope of review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Transportation challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the appeal of appellee driver from a 12-month driver's license suspension for refusal to submit to a chemical test under the implied consent law of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee driver was stopped by a police officer, and asked to perform a series of field sobriety tests which he failed. The officer then asked appellee to submit to chemical testing, but he refused. Thereafter, appellant Department of Transportation ordered a 12-month suspension of appellee's driver's license for refusal to submit to a chemical test under the implied consent law of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547. Appellant sought review of the trial court's judgment sustaining appellee's challenge of the suspension, and the court reversed. The court held that the trial court erred in requiring the police to prove probable cause for the traffic stop because the license suspension matter was a civil proceeding in which the probable cause standard was inapplicable. The court found that the proper standard of review was whether appellant had met its burden of proof. As appellee's testimony and the trial court's findings of fact were sufficient to establish reasonable grounds for the officer to believe that appellee was operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol, the court ruled that appellant met all the requirements for suspension under &sect; 1547.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's application for a bail bondsmen license was denied because of a prior felony conviction and objections to his application by a county district attorney. Respondent Insurance Commissioner affirmed the denial of petitioner's license because petitioner made threats against the county district attorney who opposed his application. On review, the court affirmed respondent's decision. The court found that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5743, which governed bail bondsmen's licenses, was not unconstitutionally vague when read with 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5746(b), which provided grounds for suspension and revocation of a license, and that the statutes together gave respondent the criteria and standards for either approving or denying a bail bondsmen's license. The court held that the discretion to grant or refuse license applications was in the discretion of respondent and that the court's review was limited only to a showing of abuse of discretion or arbitrary exercise of authority. The court affirmed the finding that petitioner's threats established that he was not sufficiently rehabilitated from his prior felony conviction to warrant approval of a bail bondsmen's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 7204 of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, 72 P.S. &sect; 7204, was amended, and the magazine exclusion from the sales tax provision was deleted. Petitioners, a trade association and several publishing companies, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against respondent Department of Revenue alleging that the amendment violated their state and federal constitutional rights and seeking to enjoin respondent from collecting the tax. Petitioners filed for summary judgment relief, and the court denied their motion. The court held that the sales tax was not an attempt to discriminate on the basis of the content of the taxpayer's speech, single out magazines for special treatment, or impede the free flow of ideas. As the sales tax focused on the format and frequency of the publication without regard to content, the court ruled that the amendment did not violate petitioners' U.S. Const. amend. I rights. The court concluded that there was a reasonable basis for the distinction in the law between newspapers and magazines, and, therefore, the tax also did not violate petitioners' rights under the equal protection or uniformity clauses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner injured person filed a civil action for damages against respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County (Pennsylvania), which arose out of an automobile accident. Respondent's pleading asserted the affirmative defense of immunity under 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2310, and petitioner filed for a declaratory judgment to determine the immunity issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an tort action against respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, petitioner injured person filed a declaratory action which sought a declaration that 1 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2310, on sovereign immunity, and 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8528, on the limitation of damages, were violative of and offensive to his rights under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. III &sect; 32. Petitioner alleged that these statutes denied him interests, liberties, rights, and benefits that were enjoyed by victims of private tortfeasors by precluding recovery of damages in an amount commensurate with his loss. The court dismissed the petition. The court noted that it could refuse to render or enter a declaratory judgment where such judgment, if rendered or entered, would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding and that declaratory relief was not available unless an actual controversy existed or was imminent. The court determined that petitioner's declaratory action was not ripe because the controversy would only have existed if a jury found respondent liable and returned a verdict against them that exceeded the statutory limitation on damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court on review sustained respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation's preliminary objections and dismissed petitioner injured person's declaratory judgment action. The court held that declaratory relief was not available unless an actual controversy existed and that a controversy would not exist unless and if a jury returned a verdict for petitioner which exceeded the statutory limitation on damages.</SPAN></P>

The court granted respondent's motion for a more specific pleading of one paragraph in the petition for review because it was not sufficiently clear and thereby impaired respondent's ability to prepare her defense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance agent filed a complaint that requested that respondent insurance commissioner be enjoined from bringing proceedings for alleged violations of the Insurance Department Act, 40 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1-321 and the Unfair Insurance Practices Act, 40 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1171.1-1171.15.

The court found that the complaint had asserted that the statutory framework of the Insurance Department created a system whereby respondent was both prosecutor and adjudicator in violation of due process rights. The court dismissed the preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer because it was not clear from the face of the complaint that the law would not have permitted recovery. The court held that it had had jurisdiction, because the exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required due to the fact that the complaint had alleged that the statutory and regulatory framework as a whole commingled the prosecutorial and adjudicatory functions unconstitutionally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Department of Insurance asserted a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer and an objection to the court's jurisdiction in an action by petitioner insurance agency alleging that the Administrative Code, 71 P.S. &sect; 189, and the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 102(a), as implemented by certain of respondent's regulations, created an unconstitutional commingling of prosecutorial and adjudicative functions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurance agency filed a complaint against respondent Department of Insurance and alleged that the Administrative Code, 71 P.S. &sect; 189, and the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.

Respondent objected in the nature of a demurrer and argued that petitioners did not plead facts that established a claim upon which relief could have been granted. The court found that whether the statutory framework created such an unconstitutional system created an issue which, if proven, would have allowed petitioners relief. Because it was not clear from the complaint that the law would not permit recovery, the court dismissed respondent's preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer. Respondents also claimed that the court did not have jurisdiction. The court disagreed, and held that exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required because the complaint asserted that the statutory framework as a whole was unconstitutional.

Appellant filed an action challenging the validity of the ordinance; the board rejected appellant's suit, and the trial court affirmed. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, holding that the zoning ordinance constituted a legitimate exercise of the township's police power, that the large minimum lot sizes were justified as reasonably related to a legitimate public interest, and that the ordinance was tailored to burden only lots with certain issues. The ordinance did not violate uniformity requirements, because appellant's land had hazardous geological or topographical conditions, an exception to the requirements. The court held that the ordinance was not preempted by the Sewage Facilities Act, 35 P.S. &sect;&sect; 750.1-750.20a, or in conflict with the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. &sect;&sect; 691.1-691.1001.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that the department of revenue misinterpreted the tax code when it promulgated a regulation that denied self-employed individuals an exclusion from income for contributions to a qualified retirement plan, but granted employees an exclusion for employer contributions. The court disagreed holding that the department's interpretation was reasonable in that contributions by self-employed persons were not ordinary business expenses and therefore could not be deducted from net profits. The court also rejected appellant's argument that the regulation violated the federal equal protection rights and the uniformity clause of the state constitution because the court maintained there was a rational basis for distinction between self-employeds who invested income already received in a retirement plan, and situations where an employee's retirement fund was entirely funded by employer contributions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought an increase in rates charged to consumers for the provision of water. After the Pennsylvania Public Service Commission (PUC) rejected the request, petitioners appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court reversed the finding that petitioners were not entitled to an expense item for an increase in income taxes due to a change in federal tax law repealing the option of deducting certain bad debts from taxable income. Under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 166, taxpayers were permitted to amortize certain income over a period of four years, so there was no basis for denying the related bad debt expense item. The court affirmed, however, to the extent that it agreed with the lower court that 66 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1327(e), which applied to acquisitions of property by water and sewer utilities for a cost lower than depreciated original cost, applied after the effective date of enactment. Based on statutory construction, the statute was accorded prospective application. Although the statute could apply to conditions in place prior to enactment, that did not result in retroactive ratemaking, as a utility had no vested right to particular ratemaking formulas.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded to the PUC for entry of a new order.</SPAN></P>

Appellant asked to be excused from posting bond or, alternatively, that her bond be reduced, as her financial resources prevented her from purchasing a bond. The trial court denied her request.

The court vacated the order, holding that the trial court erroneously interpreted &sect; 5511.41(c) to require a bond equal to the liability, as discretion was required, under &sect; 5511.41(c). The case was remanded for a hearing on what a &quot;good and sufficient&quot; bond would be for appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant quarry owner operated its quarry as a lawful preexisting nonconforming use. Appellee township adopted Tredyffrin Township, Pa., Ordinance HR-135, &sect; 1702A(6), which established quarries as a use permitted by special exception in specific quarrying districts. Both appellee zoning board and the trial court upheld the ordinance's validity.

The court affirmed as to &sect;&sect; 1702A(6)(a), (b), and (g) because they dealt with traditional land use regulations that were a legitimate exercise of appellee township's powers and were not preempted by the Act. The ordinance was valid because it did not limit or attempt to prohibit appellant's continuation of use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's affirmance of an order of respondent township board of supervisors, which denied appellant property owners' request for a curative amendment to a zoning ordinance. The court held that, while the ordinance did not specifically provide for two-family dwellings, it did allow the construction of &quot;multi-family buildings&quot; as a special exception in a certain residential district. The court held that two-family dwellings were included and subsumed within the term &quot;multi-family buildings&quot; because the ordinance defined two-family dwellings and treated other uses which would clearly be considered multi-family uses. The court held that it was inconceivable that the township would provide detailed definitions of these uses and yet fail to provide at least one district in which they could legally exist. Accordingly, the ordinance was not facially exclusionary of two-family residential uses. In addition, a use allowed by special exception was a permitted use, and an ordinance which allowed a use conditionally, as by special exception, was not de jure exclusionary. Thus, appellants failed to meet their burden of showing a partial or de facto exclusion.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 21.11(3)(iv). Petitioner argued that her vision conformed to federal standards of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect;2011-2296, and that these laws preempted the state regulations. While recognizing that Congress may preempt state law, the court noted that such legislation must contain explicit terms of preemption. The court did not find such language in the AEA. Petitioner also argued that the requirements of 37 Pa. Code &sect;&sect;21.5 and 21.21, regarding change in physical condition of an applicant for certification, were misapplied in her case because she had never been required to take a vision examination before. The court rejected her argument, holding that petitioner did not meet the vision standard when examined and therefore her license must be revoked.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas court dismissed appellant's exceptions and set a final assessment based on appellees' data.

The court remanded for re-evaluation of assessment methodologies in determining true market value and for allocating greater weight to the capitalization of income approach. The direct sales comparison approach relied on by the common pleas court ignored the current economic realities of the real estate market as well as the finding that appellant's property was unique. Because incorrect assessment ratios were applied to the property, the case was remanded for recalculation in accordance with 72 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowner's residence was located in an area zoned VR-2 as set forth in the joint municipal zoning ordinance (JMZO) adopted pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 11101-A to 11108-A. When appellants applied for a building permit the plans submitted depicted a basement area which was to remain unfinished. Thereafter appellants decided to convert the basement into a law office. Such a home occupation was not permitted in a district zoned VR-2. Appellee borough's zoning officer issued a cease and desist order, which was sustained by appellee Zoning Hearing Board and affirmed by the trial court. On review, the court affirmed; appellant's challenge to validity of the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance was found to be meritless because 53 P.S. &sect; 10811-A instructed courts to examine JMZO's as they applied to their entire jurisdictions and the JMZO under review permitted home occupation in other areas encompassed by it. Appellant's assertion of entitlement to a variance by estoppel was also without merit because appellants were duty bound to check the zoning status of their property, and there was no evidence that appellees showed some form of active acquiescence of the illegal use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court order that upheld appellee Zoning Hearing Board's decision to cease and desist a home occupation was affirmed. The court found the doctrine of vested right to use property contrary to provisions of a zoning code was not applicable because a permit had never issued for a home occupation. Appellants were not entitled to a variance by estoppel because appellee borough and zoning hearing board timely enforced the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court held that sections 1797(a) and 1797(b)(3), which prohibited direct patient billing for treatment of automobile accident victims by physicians, were not unconstitutionally overly broad because the sections pertained only to situations where a patient could reasonably be identified as an insured within the meaning of the statute.

Respondent insurance department contended that petitioner failed to show any harm resulting to its members from the operation. The court granted petitioner's motion on the basis that the reporting provisions of &sect;&sect; 1801-28 were unconstitutional because they deprived petitioner's members of the fundamental right to protection of their reputations without regard for due process and were unconstitutionally vague. The court noted that petitioner was unable to provide specific instances of harm because, although it compiled attorney names who represented insurance claimants suspected of fraud, it did not disseminate that information.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner fire captain sought review of a judgment from respondent, the State Ethics Commission (Pennsylvania). Respondent found that petitioner violated the State Ethics Act, 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 403(a) and 404(a), when he agreed to testify, at an hourly rate, for a theater owner that sought to prove it had not committed arson.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner fire captain, assigned to an arson team, investigated a fire that occurred at a theater. After a local television station reported that the fire was caused by arson, the theater owner filed a defamation suit against the station and hired petitioner to testify. Respondent, the State Ethics Commission, concluded that petitioner's work for the theater owner violated the provisions of the state ethics act, 65 P.S. &sect;&sect; 403(a) and 404(a), which applied to public officials and public employees. The court reversed respondent's order. Petitioner was not a public employee and thus not subject to the provisions of the state ethics act. 51 Pa. Code &sect; 1.1, which contained the definition of a public employee, stated that detectives were not public employees. Although neither the ethics act nor respondent's regulations defined the term &quot;detective,&quot; the common and approved usage of the term indicate that a detective was one who performed investigations and who detected lawbreakers. Petitioner's duties, which centered on investigation and detection, rendered petitioner a detective. Petitioner was a detective, not a public employee, and only public employees were subject to the ethics act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bar owners sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County (Pennsylvania), which forfeited to the state property owned by them together with all furnishings, equipment, and items of personalty found within on the basis that the bar operated on the premises was used or intended to be used to facilitate violations of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. &sect;&sect; 780-101 to 780-144.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Numerous raids by police at appellant owners' bar uncovered drugs concealed on patrons following pat-down searches. As a result, the lower court entered an order that the entire property and all contents, including the liquor license, be forfeited to the state on the basis that the bar was used or intended to be used to facilitate violations of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act (Act), 35 P.S. &sect;&sect; 780-101 to 780-144. The court found that testimony concerning the arrests made at appellants' bar, specific instances of unlawful drug activities, and physical evidence of drug-related materials on the premises supported the finding that the property was used to facilitate violations of the Act. Regardless, the court held that under the innocent owner defense, the lower court erred in entering an order forfeiting appellants' property because appellants did all that could reasonably be expected to prevent illegal use of their property where they reported illegal activities on their property to the police and warned bar patrons not to use drugs on the property. The court reversed the order forfeiting appellants' property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner collected millions of discarded tires and never obtained a permit or approval from respondent department of environmental resources for the storage or disposal of tires on his property. Respondent issued a closure order, which petitioner appealed to the environmental hearing board (board). The board dismissed the appeal, and petitioner sought review of that decision. The court affirmed the board's decision, holding that the tires posed a fire danger and harbored mosquitoes and other insects, thus constituting a public health hazard. The court held that the tires were municipal waste, subject to regulation. The court found that the dictionary definition of &quot;contain&quot; clearly contemplated the keeping of the tires in discrete piles directly on the ground within the confines of petitioner's property. The court held that the majority of the tires remained at the site for over one year, triggering the presumption that the accumulation of tires fell within the statutory presumption of disposal under the Solid Waste Management Act, 35 P.S. &sect; 6018.103. According to the court, petitioner failed to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company paid the retaliatory charge stated in a settlement but sought to recover it through administrative and judicial actions. Appellant claimed retaliatory charge computation should not have included annuity considerations, should have included all insurance companies doing business in Pennsylvania, and was violative of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the Board of Finance and Revenue, finding that the statute applied to insurance companies, not insurance products, so annuity considerations were properly included in the computation. The court also found that that statute was to be applied on an individual basis so it was possible that some companies would pay a charge and some would not. Finally, the court found that the statute was not violative of U.S. Const. amend XIV or U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, where the statute's classifications were rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of equalizing and deterring burdens on interstate insurance companies and were freed from commerce clause restrictions by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1011.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect; 6018.101 et seq., and the crimes code, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 101-9183. Petitioners had, allegedly, improperly blended solvent waste into reprocessed oil, which was determined to constitute illegal treatment and disposal of a hazardous waste. Petitioners contended that the informations failed to state offenses, SWMA was unconstitutionally vague, oil recycling had been pre-empted by federal law, selective prosecution, SWMA imposed unconstitutionally severe penalties for strict liability crimes, and SWMA violated the crimes code, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 305. The court affirmed. Used oil was a waste for purposes of the SWMA. The definitions of hazardous waste contained in the SWMA gave standards sufficient to allow an ordinary person to understand what conduct was proscribed. The existence of a federal regulatory or enforcement system did not imply the preemption of state law. No new crimes were created. The prosecution was not vindictive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bureau of liquor control challenged the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) which reversed a decision of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board which had affirmed a determination of an administrative law judge imposing a $ 50 fine on appellee licensee for violation of 47 P.S. &sect; 4-498(a). Appellee filed a precautionary cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case began when, after an investigation, appellant bureau of liquor control issued a citation alleging that appellee licensee had violated 47 P.S. &sect; 4-493(18). The administrative law judge concluded that because appellee had not displayed any advertisement for liquor on the outside of the licensed premises, there was no violation of &sect; 4-493(18), but sua sponte found a violation of 47 P.S. &sect; 4-498(a).On administrative appeal, the board rejected the constitutional arguments of appellee. Appellant filed a judicial appeal and asserted that it met its burden to demonstrate a violation of &sect; 4-493(18) and that no due process violation occurred when the administrative law judge raised the &sect; 4-498(a) violation sua sponte. The court held that the evidence did not as a matter of law demonstrate that appellee caused or permitted the violation of &sect; 4-498(a). In order for appellee to have acquiesced a violation of the Liquor Code it would have needed at least to have been aware that the trailer used was in the lot. Therefore, the order of the trial court which reversed the board's imposition of the penalty was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellee's precautionary cross-appeal was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth presented preliminary objections to two declaratory judgment actions brought by petitioners in the court's original jurisdiction to challenge the constitutionality of the State Employees' Retirement Code, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5995.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that the State Employees' Retirement Code, 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5995, violated Pa Const. art. III, &sect; 31 by impermissibly repealing part of Act 111 of 1968, 43 P.S. &sect;&sect; 217.1- 217.10 (Act 111). Petitioners argued that because the enactment of Act 111 was constitutionally mandated, its repeal or amendment would be unconstitutional. The court dismissed the petitions for review because the court found that petitioners failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could have been granted. Act 111 specifically included pensions within its list of terms and conditions of employment subject to collective bargaining. The court found that &sect; 5995 was an amendment to Act 111, and Act 111 merely permitted, but did not require the Pennsylvania General Assembly to enact Act 111. As such, the General Assembly was constitutionally authorized to amend Act 111 by later limiting petitioners' statutory collective bargaining rights. The court further found that &sect; 5955 was enacted later than Act 111, and it necessarily prevailed over any inconsistent provisions of Act 111.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the commonwealth's preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer for failure of petitioners to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, and dismissed the petitions for review, because the general assembly was not constitutionally prohibited from amending the statute, and petitioners' argument failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 26 consolidated cases, appellant developers sought review of the decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Wayne County (Pennsylvania) that affirmed the decision of appellee, County Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes, that imposed tax assessments upon 26 lots in a plan of subdivision owned by appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developers subdivided a large acreage of real property into 27 separate lots for a proposed residential development. Appellants sold one of the lots and paved a cul-de-sac for access to six of the lots. Appellee, County Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes, raised the assessment on the property based upon the subdivision, sale, and improvements. Appellee, upon a requested review by appellants, reduced the new valuations but not to the level assessed before the subdivision. The court of common pleas dismissed appellants' petition for appeal and affirmed appellee's assessment. The court affirmed the decision of the court of common pleas. The court held that appellee had authority to reassess all of the subdivided lots under Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5453.602a and the reassessment did not apply only when a lot was sold. The court held that once there had been a change in the condition of the property, such as a sale or improvement on a portion of it, appellee should allow reassessment of each new lot. The court held that this interpretation of the assessment statutes comported with Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect;1, which required uniformity of taxes for the same class of subjects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, borough and energy company, sought review of orders issued by the Environmental Hearing Board (Pennsylvania), which denied petitioner borough's motion to intervene, dismissed petitioner energy company's appeal, and granted petitioner energy company's motion to dismiss one of petitioner borough's objections. The action involved a permit issued by respondent, Pennsylvania Department of Energy Resources, pursuant to 53 P.S. &sect; 4001.511.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner energy company was given a permit by respondent, Department of Energy Resources, to build a solid waste facility in petitioner borough's community on the condition that a neighboring city agree to a waiver of the 53 P.S. &sect; 4000.511 prohibition against such a facility being constructed within 300 yards of a park. Petitioner borough contended that the permit should not have been issued prior to the grant of the waiver. The agency's grant of petitioner energy company's motion to dismiss this objection was reversed. The court held that petitioner borough's interest in protecting its environment justified its intervention and challenge. Thus, petitioner energy company's motion to quash the petition for review was denied. Petitioner energy company was required to comply with 53 P.S. &sect; 4000.511(a) permit requirements because it was a &quot;new&quot; facility. Although petitioner energy company experienced hardship as a result, the application of &sect; 4000.511(a) was not unconstitutional. Petitioner energy company lacked the standing to challenge the waiver in 53 P.S. &sect; 4000.511(d) because it could not be adversely affected by the provision. Finally, the court invalidated the permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order which denied petitioner borough's motion to intervene was reversed because it had a substantial interest in protecting its environment. The order which dismissed petitioner energy company's appeal was sustained because the application of the permit requirements was constitutional. The order which granted petitioner energy company's motion to dismiss one of petitioner borough's objections was reversed and the permit was declared invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth appealed an interlocutory order of the Common Pleas Court of Adams County (Pennsylvania), permitting defendant to redeem his interest in his house that had been forfeited, under 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to defendant's conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, the trial court ordered forfeiture of defendant's house pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6801(a)(6)(i)(C), concluding that it had been used to violate the law. The commonwealth challenged the trial court order granting defendant the right to redeem his property. The court found that defendant's motion to quash was without merit, for the redemption order was interlocutory and the commonwealth was not required to appeal until the court had resolved all issues. The court affirmed the forfeiture, but reversed the order granting defendant a right of redemption because an exercise of equitable powers was improper where the legislature provided a mandatory and exclusive statutory remedy and defendant failed to pursue it. The court held that the forfeiture statute did not exempt personal residences or provide an opportunity to redeem, and that forfeiture without redemption did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, because although the nature of defendant's violation was de minimis, the statutory requirements were met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order of the trial court forfeiting defendant's house pursuant to his conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver was affirmed, but the part of the order granting defendant a right to redeem his property was reversed, because the forfeiture statute provided an exclusive remedy of which defendant did not avail himself, and it did not provide for redemption as an equitable remedy for a de minimis violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners appealed from an order of the Common Pleas Court of Bucks County (Pennsylvania) that granted the motion of defendant township for judgment on the pleadings in a civil action for damages involving alleged defects in the construction of a house. The trial court entered judgment on the pleadings on the basis of governmental immunity and the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners filed an action against defendant township for damages relating to the construction of their home. The trial court granted defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that the action against defendant was barred by governmental immunity under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8541, and that the cause of action was time barred by the two-year statute of limitations under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5524. Plaintiffs appealed and the court reversed. The court held that the alleged negligent acts occurred during a gap between the judicial abrogation of governmental immunity and before its legislative reinstatement; therefore, there was no governmental immunity in existence at the time that the alleged negligent acts occurred. The court held that the discovery rule, which provided that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until plaintiffs discovered or, in the exercise of due diligence, should have discovered their injuries, applied to latent defects in residential construction cases. The court held that the ultimate resolution of whether plaintiffs' delay in discovering the defect was reasonable was a question for the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation failed to pay business privilege taxes assessed by appellee township by Cheltenham, Pa., Ordinance No. 1400 (1976). The trial court awarded to appellee the delinquent amount, and the court affirmed this award. Appellant contended that the business privilege tax violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 by taxing gross receipts derived from interstate services. The court disagreed, holding that the tax was not a direct tax on interstate commerce, but a tax upon the privilege of maintaining a business office within appellee township. The trial court correctly placed the burden of proof on appellant to show that the interstate portion of its revenues was exempt from the business privilege tax. The court also held that appellee's estimation of appellant's taxes was proper under the Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. &sect; 6902, because appellant refused to submit to an audit to determine the amount due. The court prevented appellant from raising the contention that appellee miscalculated the amount of the tax owed by appellant because appellant made no objection to the calculation at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment awarding appellee township the amount of business privilege taxes not paid by appellant corporation was affirmed. The tax was properly estimated when appellant refused to submit to an audit. The business privilege tax did not violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it taxed the privilege of maintaining a business within a township, rather than the revenues from any interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, owners of land adjacent to a shooting range owned by appellees, brought an action to enjoin the use of the property and alleged that it constituted a nuisance in fact because of the noise generated.

The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, finding that there were no noise ordinance regulations in place when the shooting range was constructed. On appeal, the court vacated the order and remanded the case for trial, holding that the statutory immunity only applied when there was a noise regulation in effect when the range was constructed and the range was at that time in compliance with the regulation.

Petitioner argued that respondent unlawfully continued its investigation of him during the Sunset period and that summary judgment was proper. Respondent argued that it had completed its investigation before Sunset and that nothing substantial occurred during the Sunset period. Respondent argued that the due process hearing after the termination date was merely a formality and not a significant act. The court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment and held that the language of &sect; 1795.6(f) of the Sunset Act was unequivocal as to termination. The court held that no functions or proceedings could be revived after the definitive declarations under &sect; 1795.6(f) of respondent's termination and nonexistence.

Respondent state department of revenue re-computed taxpayer's capital stock tax to be higher. After the petition for resettlement was refused by the Board of Appeals and the Board of Finance and Revenue, petitioner appealed. The court reversed, holding it could not ignore the explicit language of the code which mandated inclusion only of the &quot;income per books&quot; actually set forth on the investor's federal income tax return without inclusion of dividend income not actually reported as &quot;income per books.&quot; That statutory definition of &quot;average net income&quot; fully comported with sound and generally accepted accounting principles. 61 Pa.

The lease contained an option for appellees' granddaughter to buy the leased portion of the parcel. She exercised the option and assigned it to appellees. Appellants refused to convey the leased portion, arguing that under the Municipal Planning Code and a Township Ordinance the subdivision had to be approved by authorities. Appellees filed a petition for specific performance. The trial court granted the petition, stating that the statute and the ordinance could only restrict the use of the land, not its alienablity. Appellants challenged, arguing that the order compelled them to perform an illegal transaction. Because evidence was excluded on the issue of the viability of subdividing the property, the final decree was vacated and remanded for a determination of whether it was possible to subdivide the parcel as contemplated in the lease and purchase option. If subdivision was not possible, the trial court erred when it ordered specific performance of the sales contract.

The court held that appellee failed to pursue the remedial route mandated by 53 P.S. &sect; 11004, which was by way of a curative amendment proceeding before appellant. Hence, appellee's challenge before the trial court was improper because the it was based solely on the validity of the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, disability service providers and disabled residents, challenged the order from the Common Pleas Court of Erie County (Pennsylvania), which denied their request for attorney's fees and costs in their zoning appeal against appellant town zoning board. Appellant initially challenged the trial court's order, which reversed appellant and found the town's group home ordinance unconstitutional. Appellant then abandoned its appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Millcreek Township adopted an ordinance excluding certain types of group disability homes. Appellees, disability service providers and disabled residents, sought review with appellee town zoning board, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. Appellant rejected appellees' claims. The trial court reversed, finding a violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3604(f). Appellant sought review of the merits but abandoned its appeal. Appellees filed a cross-action for the trial court's denial of attorney's fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3613(c) as prevailing parties. The appellate court affirmed. The court held that under the latter two statutes, attorney fees were not available to an administrative appeal from a zoning board decision. Such a challenge was not a &quot;lawsuit.&quot; The Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply. Section 1988 fees could only be awarded in a lawsuit initiated by a complaint where a jury could be impaneled, and damages awarded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, sought review of the order from the Court of Common Pleas, Washington County (Pennsylvania), which held that 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 525 prevented the suspension of appellee driver's operating privilege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, suspended appellee driver's operating license for violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1785. Appellee challenged the suspension asserting that it would have frustrated his Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan as he depended on his driver's license for employment, and the trial court held that 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 525 prevented the suspension of appellee's license. On appeal, the court held that motor vehicle financial responsibility statutes were not discriminatory per se because state law might not make a discriminatory distinction based exclusively on the existence of a debt in bankruptcy, and they were valid as long as the law applied to all motorists regardless of their financial status. The court held that suspension was mandatory for a violation of &sect; 1785 even where unfairness to appellee or inequity might have resulted. The court reversed the order of the trial court, finding that &sect; 1785 did not violate the anti-discrimination provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1301-1330.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order from the trial court that held that the Bankruptcy Code prevented the suspension of appellee driver's operating privilege. The court held that suspension of appellee's license was mandatory under the motor vehicle financial responsibility statute, and that the statute was not discriminatorily based on the existence of appellee's debt in bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>

Its New York employees solicited and accepted orders. Petitioner sought a refund of the tax paid to the commonwealth for certain years on the basis that much of its income had been made out of state. Petitioner failed previously to inform the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue that it conducted business in New York because it did not believe that it was subject to taxation there and because it anticipated that the &quot;throw out&quot; rule would be used in apportioning its income. Petitioner thereafter sought application of the five-year limitation period in 72 P.S. &sect; 503(a)(4) for filing a claim refund. The Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Review refused the petitions for refund. The court affirmed. First, the cases relied upon by petitioner could not trigger the five-year limitation period because they did not involve an interpretation of the statute under which petitioner paid its corporate income tax to Pennsylvania. Second, petitioner should have known that it was subject to taxation in New York. Reliance on the &quot;throw-out&quot; rule could not save petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners operated a sanitation collection service on property, which was a non-conforming use. At the start, they hauled trash directly to the landfills and used the property for equipment storage. Thereafter, they found it necessary to store trash in their building until it could be transferred to landfills. Appellants received a permit from the Department of Environmental Resources (DER) to operate a trash transfer station. Appellee Zoning Hearing Board (the board) found that the trash transfer station was a permissible reasonable expansion of the pre-existing, non-conforming use as a sanitation collection service and imposed conditions to the continued operation of it. The trial court affirmed. The court affirmed and held that the board's findings were sufficient to support its conclusion that the trash transfer station was an expansion of the prior non-conforming use, in accordance with the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 10908(9). The court also affirmed certain conditions imposed to the transfer station such as hours of operation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the governor signed the General Appropriation Act of 1987, P.L. 459, the budget office concluded sufficient funds did not exist to increase the net operating rate ceilings as of January 1, 1988 and advised that the increase could not start until April 1, 1988. The legislature amended the act and included a deficiency appropriation. The governor signed the supplemental act but instructed the budget secretary to disregard the conditional language dealing with the effective date. He based his decision on a conviction that the starting date was substantive language, which Pa. Const. art. 3, &sect; 11prohibited in a general appropriation bill. Respondent department of public works issued an interim rate notice advising petitioner nursing home that the increase in net operating cost ceilings was retroactive to April 1, 1988. Petitioner filed an appeal with the Office of Hearing and Appeals contending the revised rates should have been retroactive to January 1, 1988. The examiner denied the petition.

The trial court granted appellee's motion for judgment n.o.v., and appellants sought review. The court reversed. The court stated that the trial court erred when it held that appellants were not afforded a good faith defense. The issue of a good faith defense depended upon whether the trooper violated a clearly established statutory or constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known. The limits to which disclosure might be made under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5717(a) were at best unclear when the trooper transferred the intercepted information to the IRS and PDR.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurer sought review of a decision of respondent Insurance Department of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which was affirmed by respondent insurance department commissioner, disapproving its extraordinary circumstances (except for underinsured motorist coverage) filing pursuant to the Act of February 7, 1990, P.L. 11 (Act 6), 75 Pa. Con. Stat. &sect; 1799.7(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurer submitted a filing for extraordinary circumstances pursuant to the Act of February 7, 1990, P.L. 11 (Act 6), 75 Pa. Con. Stat. &sect; 1799.7 (b)(3), as to why it increased its rates. Respondent Insurance Department of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania disapproved of this filing, which decision was overruled in a limited fashion by respondent insurance department commissioner. The court vacated and remanded respondents' decision, finding that the Casualty and Surety Rate Regulatory Act, Act of June 11, 1947, P.L. 538, as amended, 40 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1181-1199, applied to extraordinary circumstances filings. The court found no indication that petitioner faced administrative bias simply by respondent commissioner's statement that he believed that an insurer earning a 12 percent rate of return had not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances. The court also found that prosecutorial and adjudicatory roles cannot commingle in a rate-making matter because there had been no prosecution, as there was no allegation petitioner had violated a law or regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated and remanded respondent insurance department commissioner's decision for further consideration and proceedings, finding that the statute applied to extraordinary circumstances filings. The court found no indications of bias, nor did it find that petitioner insurer's due process rights had been violated by a commingling of prosecutorial and adjudicative functions, declaring that such commingling did not happen in rate cases.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion for peremptory judgment, ordered appellees to refrain from collecting school taxes, and refused to open the peremptory judgment. On appeal, the court reversed because fringe benefits were included in the salary exception in &sect; 6-672. The court determined that fringe benefits were treated as wages to employees. Because salary and wages were substantially the same, the court concluded that salary under &sect; 6-672 included payment for fringe benefits. The court's interpretation was supported by 24 P.S. &sect; 5-513, which authorized school districts to provide insurance and pension benefits to their employees and to deduct the cost of benefit payments from the employees' salary.</SPAN></P>

Claimant filed a petition that alleged his depression was a work-related psychological injury, and respondent State Agency Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board dismissed claimant's petition. The court affirmed, and found that claimant failed to objectively prove an abnormal working condition. The audit did not increase claimant's responsibilities or work load. His injury resulted from his subjective reaction to the audit. The treating physician's testimony was incompetent to prove a causal connection between the injury and the audit because the physician did not have a complete grasp on claimant's work situation. The additional, substantive burden of proving an abnormal work condition was reasonable to prevent fraudulent psychiatric injury claims based on normal work conditions and did not violate claimant's equal protection and due process rights. Because the burden of proof was a rule to guide respondent and did not mandate nor prohibit any behavior, the vagueness doctrine did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant apartment complex owner requested an exclusion for its 174 unit complex from appellee borough's garbage ordinance, which required collection by appellee's contractor. Appellee refused to grant exclusion and appellant filed an action to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional. The court found appellee's criteria for exclusion, specifically, production of more than six 21-gallon containers of garbage a week if it constituted an unreasonable burden on the collector, was reasonably related to the purpose of the ordinance because the criteria allowed appellee to control garbage collection and still exclude garbage generators that would overwhelm the system. The court found that appellee's fees, though high, were not unreasonable because collection for appellant was being subsidized by the other residents in the borough. Finally, the court found that appellant's treatment as one entity for the purposes of bid specifications and billing, and as 174 entities for purposes of the exclusion, was an unreasonable interpretation of the ordinance and remanded to the trial court to determine if collection of appellant's garbage constituted an unreasonable burden to the collector.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Department of Environmental Resources issued compliance orders against petitioner former and current operators, including the estate of an operator. The Environmental Hearing Board denied petitioner estate's request to dismiss respondent's action against it, and substituted deceased's personal representatives as parties.

The court held that although petitioner former operators had sold the mine prior to the compliance order, they acknowledged that it was not in compliance with the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. &sect; 691.1 et seq., while they operated it. The court held that 35 P.S. &sect; 691.315(a) did not permit estoppel to be raised against the commonwealth, so respondent was authorized to take action when it did. The court held that the trial court's order substituting the personal representatives of deceased for petitioner estate was binding. The court held that deceased allowed discharges from the mine site to enter the tributary, and that it was not necessary to establish a causal link between mining activities and stream pollution for liability to attach under &sect; 691.315(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, denied petitioner insurance companies extraordinary circumstances relief under 75 Pa.

Petitioner claimed that it was entitled to relief for an after-tax rate of return of less than 12 percent. On appeal, the court held that there was no basis for finding that the 12 percent threshold set by respondent was a &quot;regulation,&quot; in that it was not promulgated through statutory rulemaking procedures or adjudications and did not have the force of law, and found that the commissioner's discretion was not bound by the threshold. There was no abuse of discretion in the commissioner's rate of return determination because it comported with the Casualty &amp; Surety Rate Regulatory Act, 40 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1181-1199, and was nonconfiscatory under U.S. Const. amends. V,XIV. The court remanded for further proceedings, however, because there was not adequate support in the record for the premium trend used by the commissioner and the commissioner erred in using the figure of 16 percent for petitioner's rate of reduction, when it was actually 16.8 percent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a decision by the Common Pleas Court of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which awarded damages to appellees, injured child and parents, for a swimming pool injury at appellant's facility, and denied appellant's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, injured child and parents, recovered damages for injuries received by appellee injured child when she dove into a outdoor swimming pool at a recreational area operated by appellant city. On appeal, the court affirmed the award of damages and determined that appellant was not entitled to sovereign immunity under 68 P.S. &sect; 471-1, which only applied to unimproved land. The court also determined that the real property exception to government immunity under 42 P.S. &sect; 8546(b)(3), applied because the acts of the appellant made the property unsafe for the intended use of the property and was the supervening cause of the injury. The court determined that jury instructions regarding the standard of care for a young child were appropriate even though they were not the model jury instructions, because they adequately stated the law that applied to the evidence in the case. The court accepted the trial court's determination on juror perjury because appellant had failed to preserve the error by failing to request a transcript of voir dire and by failing to ask questions on the contested issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of damages to appellees, injured child and parents, in their action against the appellant city for damages after a swimming pool accident because the city did not have statutory governmental or recreational immunity because the property was improved upon and appellant had the duty to maintain the improvements and protect users against foreseeable injuries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant was employed as a school teacher by petitioner employer, a catholic church. There was no employment contract acknowledging petitioner's rights to terminate the employment for violating a law of the church. Claimant informed petitioner of her intent to marry a non-catholic man, who was previously divorced, and whose previous marriage was not annulled. Petitioner warned claimant that the marriage would violate the church's policy and result in termination. Prior to the marriage, the employment was terminated. Petitioner challenged respondent Unemployment Compensation Board of Review's decision granting compensation benefits to claimant. On appeal, the court reversed and held that claimant's actions constituted willful misconduct because, although there was no employment contract, she was informed and aware that the marriage violated respondent's policy and would result in termination but proceeded with the marriage, and claimant was terminated because of her marriage not because of violating a law of the church. Also, claimant's conduct directly reflected on her ability to perform her duties. Further, denial of benefits was not an excessive entanglement of religion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed respondent Unemployment Compensation Board of Review's award of compensation benefits to claimant because her going forward with the marriage after being informed that the marriage violated petitioner employer's policy and would result in termination of her employment constituted willful conduct. The denial of claimant's request for unemployment compensation benefits was not an unconstitutional establishment of religion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, petitioners, transportation authority and city, appealed from an order of respondent Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, which found that petitioners had certain maintenance responsibilities for a bridge that was part of a separated rail-highway crossing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, transportation authority and city, appealed respondent public utility commission's order requiring petitioners to maintain the bridge. An investigation by respondent revealed that no one was maintaining the bridge and commenced an investigation to determine ownership and to appoint maintenance responsibilities. After hearings to determine final maintenance responsibilities, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that petitioners were the owners of the bridge and assigned permanent maintenance responsibilities to petitioners. Respondent adopted the ALJ's decision with minor technical modifications. On appeal, the court found that petitioners were not exempt under 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 581(c)(5) from the imposition of maintenance responsibilities for the substructure and superstructure of the bridge. The court found that petitioners were not exempt from the maintenance responsibilities imposed by respondent under 55 P.S. &sect; 600.342. The court concluded that because the chain of title to the bridge was unbroken, petitioners were the owner and were therefore responsible for primary maintenance. The court affirmed but remanded for modification of the division of ownership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent coal mining companies applied for permits to operate underground bituminous mines in Pennsylvania. Petitioner, the Department of Environmental Resources (DER), approved the permits, subject to respondent's compliance with standard permit conditions contained therein. Respondents filed separate appeals against DER challenging the additional conditions, and the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB) consolidated and heard the appeals. It determined that DER had not complied with the statutory requirements of promulgating new regulations, and as a result, the regulations were invalid. DER challenged the decision of the EHB, but the court affirmed the decision. Even though DER called their additions &quot;conditions,&quot; the court found that they were actually regulations and as such were to be promulgated according to the Commonwealth Documents Law, 45 P. S. &sect;&sect; 1201, 1202. Because the regulations had the binding force of law, the fact that they could be considered generic did not relieve the necessity to provide the proper notice pursuant to statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant elector sought review of the order from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), dismissing his action in which appellant sought to have intervenor candidate be declared ineligible to seek the office of mayor in the municipal election for alleged violations of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter and the Pennsylvania Election Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor candidate campaigned to run for the office of mayor of Philadelphia. Appellant elector sought to have him declared ineligible for this candidacy, claiming that he violated both the Pennsylvania Election Code and the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter by beginning his campaign while he was still holding the office of district attorney for the city. Though intervenor had begun the planning stages of his campaign during that time, he had not publicly announced his intent to seek the office or attempt to raise campaign funds before he resigned from the district attorney position. The lower court dismissed appellant's petition, and he challenged this decision. At the same time, intervenor filed a motion to quash, claiming improper jurisdiction. The court denied the motion to quash but affirmed the lower court's dismissal of appellant's action in equity. The court found that intervenor had not acted to deceive the voters in any way, nor had he used his prior office to further his campaign. His candidacy activities did not begin until after his resignation, and signatures on his candidacy petition counted even though they might have been collected before his announcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied intervenor candidate's motion to quash because jurisdiction was proper. The court further affirmed the lower court's determination of dismissal because there was no evidence of intervenor's improper behavior during his campaign or prior to announcing his candidacy, as was alleged by appellant elector, and the lower court properly upheld the reporter's privilege in not forcing him to reveal his sources.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, husband and wife, filed an action for injuries appellee wife sustained when she stepped into a pothole located in a street railway roadbed. Appellants, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and city, were found liable. Appellee, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDot), was absolved of liability. The court affirmed the judgment as to appellants' liability. The court reversed the finding that PennDot was in contempt. Under a leaseback agreement between SEPTA and appellant city, SEPTA was responsible for leased property maintenance. The court found that pursuant to the agreement &quot;leased property&quot; included the roadbed between and adjacent to the street railway tracks, and that SEPTA was required to indemnify appellant city for the award. When agreeing to submit to &quot;high/low&quot; arbitration, SEPTA, PennDot, and appellant city agreed to pay one-third of the cost of the award, but PennDot refused to pay. Because the trial court failed to hold a hearing to determine whether PennDot believed that the agreement no longer existed, it was improper for the trial court to find PennDot in contempt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, State Board of Medicine, revoked petitioner physician's license to practice medicine. Respondent concluded that petitioner's conduct was unprofessional and immoral as proscribed by 63 P.S. &sect; 422.41(8)(i) and 49 Pa. Code &sect; 16.61(b)(2), and that he had abused a patient in violation of 49 Pa. Code &sect; 16.61(a)(16). Petitioner contended that his due process rights were violated, that respondent lacked impartiality and improperly commingled the adjudicative and prosecutorial functions, and that he was prejudiced by the unjustified delay in bringing the action. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that petitioner's due process rights were not violated because he was afforded a meaningful hearing before his license was revoked permanently. The court held, however, that the facts were sufficient to establish prejudice against petitioner due to the unjustified delay in bringing the action against him because the passage of time had diminished the victim's memory to a point that it had rendered her testimony so fluid that petitioner was severely prejudiced in preparing his defense, and several key witnesses were unavailable to testify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After active service, petitioner veterans were employed by the commonwealth and entered the Pennsylvania State Employee's' Retirement System (retirement system). Before retirement, petitioners sought to purchase retirement credit for military service but their requests were denied, pursuant to 71 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5304(b). After petitioners retired, a district court ruled that &sect; 5304(b) was unconstitutional because it conflicted with 10 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1336 and petitioners again sought to purchase service credit. Respondent State Employee's Retirement Board denied the request. The court affirmed respondent's decision and held that the caselaw that determined the unconstitutionality of &sect; 5304(b) was not to be applied retroactively. The court held that the caselaw decided an issue of first impression not clearly foreshadowed, that retroactive application of the caselaw would not further the purpose of &sect; 1336, and that retroactive application would impose a penalty on the retirement system due to the potential for fund instability. The court held that the retirement system did not intentionally or negligently misrepresent the law to petitioners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of the order of the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the preliminary objections of appellee township and dismissed appellants' mandamus and damages counts, in appellants action against appellee township. Appellee township's board of commissioners had refused to approve appellants' subdivision request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners applied for subdivision of a residentially zoned parcel of land. Appellee township's board of commissioners rejected the application. The trial court sustained preliminary objections by appellee and dismissed appellants' mandamus and damages counts. On appeal, the court reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded, holding that appellee's reasons for rejection were not sustainable as a matter of law. The court held that the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 10101-11202, expressly retained the mandamus remedy when entitlement to the issuance of a land use permit was clear. Because appellants had fully complied with zoning requirements, appellee had a nondiscretionary duty to approve their subdivision request. The court held that while mandamus damages were recoverable under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8303, appellants could have recovered only the damages that were incidental to the specific relief sought. Finally, the court held that compensation for temporary loss of the use of land was not recoverable, as there was a specific remedy for damages resulting from the breach of a nondiscretionary duty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the mandamus count, because appellant landowners had complied with township code; sustained the preliminary objections to the claim for interference with contract; and remanded for appellee township to grant approval of the preliminary plan and with processing of final subdivision plan when presented. The damage claim was to be confined to any loss of use from the period that appellee withheld approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order which rejected appellant developer's contention that the City of Philadelphia Zoning Code was unconstitutional in that it allegedly excluded mobile home park development. The court ruled that the zoning code was not de jure or de facto exclusionary of mobile home parks, as mobile home park development was provided for in seven other residentially zoned districts, but that appellant never sought permits for those allowed residential areas. The court found that the fact that the zoning code did not contain specific provision addressing mobile home park development was not, in and of itself, a basis for finding an unconstitutional exclusion of that use. The court also ruled that appellant did not meet his burden of proving the zoning code was unconstitutional by reason of the alleged de jure exclusion of any reference to a mobile home or trailer park district.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the issue was justiciable under the Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7531-7541. The court held that the action was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel, as the issue in the previous proceeding regarding contempt was not the same issue in this proceeding. The court found that the judiciary's control of county funds was secondary to that of the legislature or county salary board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, insurance commissioner, filed preliminary objections to the petition for review of petitioners, chiropractic board, chiropractors, and patient, who sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the amendment of &sect; 1797 of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa.

The court sustained preliminary objections one and eight, sustained in part and overruled in part objection four, and overruled objections two, three, five, six, seven, and nine. The court held that the amendments were all related to the single purpose of restructuring the regulation of motor vehicle insurance in the state and reducing the cost of insurance to policy holders and thus petitioners failed to state a violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The court held that respondent was a state actor subject to due process and equal protection constraints. The court held that 1990 Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurer submitted a request for a rate increase. Petitioner received a letter requesting more information. Thirty days thereafter, insurer sent a partial response. Respondent notified petitioner that its rate filing was deemed withdrawn by operation of law. The next day insurer petitioned for judicial review and filed a second request for a rate increase. Respondent moved to dismiss because insurer had not appealed the deemed withdrawal to the insurance commission. The court ruled the deemed withdrawal was a final adjudication and that it had jurisdiction. It also ruled the second filing did not render the question moot because the effective dates were different. In considering the merits, the court found that the letter requesting information could not trigger the deemed withdrawal pursuant to 31 Pa. Code &sect; 129.12 because the letter failed to state it was a formal request for information under 31 Pa. Code &sect; 129.11 and that a reply was required within 30 days. Because respondent improperly deemed the rate filing withdrawn or to take timely action, the rate increase was deemed approved.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 31, &sect; 700j-802(4). Petitioner consumers contended that retail minimum price controls of milk were an unconstitutional violation of their substantive due process rights because such price controls were an unreasonable exercise of police power, unduly oppressive, and without a real and substantial relation to the objectives of the law. The Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Board (Board) filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The court sustained the Board's demurrer. The court determined the law's legislative purpose was for the protection of the public health and welfare and for the prevention of fraud. The court ruled that retail minimum price controls were a rational means to be employed by the legislature to achieve the determined objections. Thus, the retail minimum price control scheme could not be said to be arbitrary, discriminatory, or irrelevant to the legislative policy. The law was rationally related to the objectives of the law and passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources filed preliminary objections, including a demurrer, to petitioner association's action for review of an executive order. Although petitioner at first did not comply with Pa. R. App. P. 1514(c), it cured an amendable defect with proper service by certified mail. Petitioner did not have to exhaust administrative remedies. The executive order could properly be challenged under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7531-7541, because petitioner presented issues premised on a constitutional violation and violations of the legislated regulatory scheme. Because petitioner had pled not only a discernibly adverse effect upon its members, but had also pled the immediacy of the order's effect, it had standing to bring the declaratory judgment action. However, neither petitioner nor its members had standing to seek mandamus. Concerning the declaratory judgment count, petitioner pled sufficient facts to withstand the demurrer, but on a separation of powers count, the court granted the demurrer. The court overruled the preliminary objections in part and sustained in part.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner association belatedly made proper service by certified mail. Petitioner did not have to exhaust administrative remedies. The immediate adverse effect of the order provided standing to bring the declaratory judgment action, but not for mandamus. Petitioner pled sufficient facts to withstand a demurrer on one count, but it had not done so on another count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insurer refused to renew automobile insurance policies of respondent insureds after each had been involved in two automobile accidents within a three-year period prior to the renewal date. Respondents requested a review by the state insurance department, which concluded that petitioner had violated 40 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1008.3(b), which precluded cancellation based upon one accident within the three-year period preceding the renewal date, and ordered policy reinstatement. Petitioner sought judicial review, arguing that the administrative agency erred in interpreting the work &quot;accident&quot; to mean only those incidents where the insurer was required to pay a claim. In affirming the administrative ruling, the court concluded that the statutory construction was not clearly erroneous but was reasonable. Cancellation or refusal to renew was statutorily precluded where the incidents were not the fault of the insured or the insurer was not required to make any payment. Where only one of the two incidents for each policyholder was one wherein petitioner was required to make payment or where the insured was liable, petitioner's refusal to renew the policy was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset County (Pennsylvania) that found it guilty of four separate summary offenses in violation of the Air Pollution Control Act and imposed fines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer received citations charging it with nuisance and violation of the Air Pollution Control Act in operating its facility. After a de novo trial, appellant was found guilty, and the trial court imposed fines. Appellant challenged the adverse judgment, arguing that the nuisance ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that the issuance of a citation based upon an officer's observation of a single could of dust was insufficient to support a charge of violating air pollution standards. In affirming, the court concluded that the language of the nuisance ordinance clearly set forth what conduct constituted a nuisance and was not so ambiguous that it would cause improper applications thereof. As such, appellant's overbreadth and vagueness challenge failed. Further, a violation of &sect; 123.2 of the Department of Environmental Resources regulations was committed when particle matter was omitted into the outdoor atmosphere that was visible outside of the individual's property. No special equipment was necessary to uphold a conviction, and the observation of a cloud of dust was sufficient to establish a violation of the air pollution regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed because the nuisance ordinance was not vague and overbroad where it adequately set forth the prohibited conduct. Further, where the air pollution regulations provided for a penalty whenever particle matter was emitted from a facility and was observable to passersby, the single cloud of dust emitted from appellant's facility was sufficient to support a conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner operated a licensed vehicle dealership. Although convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of federal law, petitioner continued to operate his dealership. Petitioner's application for a renewal of his license was denied after respondent administrative agency concluded that his convictions for drug offenses constituted crimes involving moral turpitude and provided a basis for license revocation under &sect; 104 of the Board of Vehicles Act, 63 P.S. &sect; 818.10(4). Petitioner sought judicial review. In affirming respondent's denial of the license renewal, the court concluded that respondent's interpretation of the term &quot;moral turpitude&quot; was not improper. Moral turpitude had been deemed anything contrary to honesty or good morals, and the organizing and selling of a controlled substance was an offense against public morals. Respondent was charged with regulating a business that affected the public welfare, and petitioner's past conduct was relevant to the issue of whether he possessed the integrity and good moral character necessary for the issuance of a license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found appellant township resident had violated a township ordinance prohibiting the storing of disabled motor vehicles upon any private property located within appellee township and sentenced appellant to fines and costs. Appellant sought review and asserted that appellee did not have the authority to declare or define the storage of junked or abandoned automobiles as nuisances per se. The court agreed and held that an ordinance that sought to abate the storage of wrecked, junked, or abandoned vehicles could not declare the mere presence of such vehicles on any given property to be a nuisance per se. The court held that appellee had the authority to prohibit, remove, or cause to be removed disabled vehicles on private property if they were, in fact, nuisances to the public. The court noted that where a reasonable interpretation of an ordinance could be made to save its constitutionality, the court was obliged to adopt it. The court therefore held that the ordinance would be interpreted as requiring appellee to prove a nuisance in fact to sustain a conviction under the ordinance. The court reversed the order imposing judgment of sentence upon appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a licensed funeral director and sold pre-arranged funeral service agreements. Respondent funeral directors board (board) filed an order to show cause against petitioner alleging his violation of their regulations by using a contract for pre-arranged funeral services which provided that 30 percent of the total purchase price for funeral services selected would be retained by the funeral home for consulting and arranging the funeral plans. Petitioner filed an answer denying the allegations. Respondent board issued an order revoking petitioner's funeral director and funeral supervisor licenses and fined him. Petitioner sought a stay which was granted pending his appeal's outcome. Respondent board filed a motion to strike petitioner's brief. The court concluded that the applicable regulation required that 100 percent of the funds collected by funeral directors for pre-need services and merchandise incidental to such services be placed in trust.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of a court order that granted appellee borough's preliminary objections to appellant's petition for declaratory judgment. Appellants argued that an ordinance enacted by appellee was unconstitutional because it imposed personal liability on landowners for their tenant's water utility payments. The ordinance made an owner leasing property personally liable for water service provided to tenants under a contract for service between the tenant and the borough water system. The court affirmed and held that under 53 P.S. &sect; 7107, municipalities had the power to enter liens against property for which water service had been rendered; a lien against property was an action in rem and did not authorize direct personal liability. The court held that the borough had the power to regulate the collection of unpaid water bills under 53 P.S. &sect; 46202. Therefore, the court held that the ordinance did no more than the state law allowed. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional because the legislation had a substantial relationship to the asserted governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

Appellant had been cited for violating a law against dumping solid waste without a permit on his farm and obstructing environmental agents. State environmental agents made an unannounced, warrantless inspection of appellant's farm, took a soil sample, and had a camera. Appellant forcibly removed the agents' camera and soil sample when he ordered them from the property. Appellant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the criminal charges contending the warrantless entry violated U.S. Const. amend. IV. The criminal charges were dismissed, then reinstated in the lower court by application of United States Supreme Court precedent allowing use of the open fields doctrine. Appellant was convicted, then filed post-conviction motions contending the warrantless entry violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The trial court found appellant waived this argument by not raising it in a pre-trial motion. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner had requested that respondent state insurance department grant it a hearing as to this rollback provision. Respondent denied a hearing. Petitioner appealed. The court found that petitioner had an interest, via its contract in the approved rate filing, and in receiving a fair return from policyholders for the coverage it provides them. The court noted that there was nothing wrong with petitioner's profit-making goal provided it did not achieve its ends by charging rates which would be excessive under the Rate Act (Act 6) , 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1701-1798. The court defined the government's interest was to curb escalating insurance costs. The court balanced the competing interests and looked at the procedural safeguards. The court affirmed the letter of the respondent denying a hearing to petitioner inasmuch as she lacked authority to conduct a hearing. The court concluded, however, that petitioner insurer was entitled to relief. The court also found the amendments to Act 6 were unconstitutional on its face insofar as it purported to roll back rates approved before Act 6 was effective.</SPAN></P>

School teachers that worked for public or private entities were able to receive unemployment compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant was employed as a teacher at an elementary school which was owned and operated by a parish. Claimant filed for unemployment compensation benefits, but because he was employed by a religious organization, both the referee and the respondent, unemployment compensation review board (board), found that he was not entitled to benefits pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 753. Claimant sought review alleging that the Unemployment Compensation Law was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court applied United States Supreme Court precedent that unless a classification was inherently suspect, such as those based on race, color, creed or national origin, a classification's validity was tested by assessing whether the classification has some reasonable basis. In this case, the reasonable basis was to ensure that the free exercise clause was not frustrated as United States Supreme Court precedent had found that Congress had not intended for parochial schools to pay unemployment taxes. The court found no violation of the claimant's equal protection rights and affirmed the decision of the respondent board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant sought review of a decision from respondent Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Pennsylvania), which affirmed an order denying her death benefit claim under 77 P. S. &sect; 411(1). Petitioner contended that the statutory time limitation that precluded appellant's claim violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, and the due process and equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant filed a fatal claim petition that resulted from the death of her husband, which the parties stipulated was caused by a death related injury. Respondent workmen's compensation appeal board affirmed an order that denied the claim based upon the time limitation imposed by 77 P. S. &sect; 411(1), which required that the death had to occur within 300 weeks after the injury. Petitioner sought review, contending the statute was in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, and the due process and equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. I. The court affirmed, finding that Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, permitted such time limitations, provided that they applied equally to corporations and individuals. The court determined that 77 P. S. &sect; 411(1) was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable and bore a reasonable relationship to the legitimate state objective of preserving the compensation fund for those most entitled to it by lessening the opportunity for intervening causes to become determinative factors in fatal claim petitions, thus concluding that there was a rational basis for treating work-related injuries differently from occupational ones.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that denied the death benefit claim of petitioner claimant, finding that the claim was barred by the statutory time period within which such claims had to be filed. The time period was constitutional, because it lessened the opportunity for intervening causes to weaken the causal connection between injury and death and preserved the compensation fund for those most entitled to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motorcyclist lost control of his motorcycle when he encountered potholes on a highway. Appellant filed a complaint against appellee, the state department of transportation, seeking to recover damages for his injuries. Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that appellant had failed to provide appellee with actual written notice of the pothole defects prior to the accident as required by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8522(b)(5). The trial court granted the motion, and appellant sought review, challenging the constitutionality of the notice requirement. The court noted that a statute was cloaked with a strong presumption of constitutionality, and one who attacked it bore the burden of demonstrating that the legislation clearly, palpably, and plainly violated the constitution. Appellant failed to show how the statute violated his constitutional rights. In addition, the statute's notice requirement had a legitimate basis, in that it gave appellee sufficient notice of a condition so that it was able to cure the defect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, voters, sought review of an order from the Common Pleas Court, Bucks County (Pennsylvania), which compelled reapportionment of the school district and adopted a phased-in implementation plan. Appellants argued that the order violated Section 303 of the School Code, 24 P.S. &sect; 3-303, and the constitutional &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, voters, filed suit pursuant to Section 303 of the Public School Code of 1949, 24 P.S. &sect; 3-303, to correct an imbalance in population among three regions which comprised the school district. The trial court adopted a reapportionment plan and ordered that it be phased in, beginning with a special election to fill the remaining years of the terms of three incumbents who no longer resided within the district from which they were elected. Appellants sought review and argued that the plan should be implemented immediately, electing an entire new board using the new voting regions at the first opportunity. The court found that the trial court's action struck a balance between two competing provisions of Section 303. Subsection (a) provided for staggered four year terms; subsection (b)(3) provided that three members should be elected every two years for terms of six years. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by devising an implementation plan that insured that each district would be represented by three resident directors and left intact the statutory scheme for staggering the elections. Therefore, the court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that condemnees' claim could not be raised in preliminary objections. Preliminary objections filed pursuant to &sect; 406(a) of the Eminent Domain Code, 26 P.S. &sect; 1-406(a), only authorized challenges to the condemnor's power or purpose to take the property which included compliance with statutorily mandated procedures, as well as technical challenges such as service or sufficiency of bond.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctor challenged the Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 P. S. &sect; 1301.701(e)(1), which required doctors who had a majority of their practice in Pennsylvania to pay a surcharge into a fund used to reimburse patients for malpractice. Petitioner claimed that the surcharge was a revenue-producing tax measure rather than a license fee or other permissible exercise of the Commonwealth's police power. The court disagreed and granted the motion for summary judgment filed by respondent state agencies. The court found that the surcharge funds were held in trust to compensate victims of medical malpractice and were not revenues used for general public purposes. The surcharge was applicable to doctors with a majority of their practice in the state and was a condition of practice in the state. In addition, the body administering the surcharge regulated petitioner to the extent it required participation in the program to alleviate a shortage of medical malpractice coverage. Finally, the surcharge was used in administering the fund, but also to pay actual claims to patients. Thus, the surcharge met the requirements of a license fee.</SPAN></P>

The surcharge challenged by petitioner was not an impermissible tax, but instead was a license fee imposed upon doctors to provide coverage for patients in the event of medical malpractice.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the suspension of his license and the trial court affirmed. Appellant then brought an appeal and the court affirmed the suspension. The court held that &sect; 1547 did not violate either U.S. Const. amend.

The court determined that the state could regulate the use of its highways, and in doing so could require chemical testing once a person was arrested for driving while under the influence and that person had no constitutional right to refuse a test and had no constitutional right to request a specific test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city challenged the order of the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which denied its motion for post-trial relief and entered judgment against defendants city and driver and in favor of plaintiffs, victims of car accident, in a personal injury case. The trial court found that plaintiffs' claims against defendant city were not barred by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8541. Plaintiffs cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, victims of car accident, filed a personal injury action after car accident that caused death and serious injuries to plaintiffs. Just before defendant driver reached a turn in the road where the accident occurred, there was a traffic directional sign, which had been erected by defendant city, warning defendant driver that the road ahead curved to the left. In fact, the road curved to the right. Defendant driver followed the traffic directional sign, curved to the left, crossed over the median, and struck plaintiffs' vehicle. In a separate criminal action, defendant driver pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol. The jury attributed 80 percent of the liability to defendant driver and the remaining 20 percent to defendant city. Thereafter, the trial court molded the jury verdict and denied defendant's city's motion for post-trial relief. The court reversed and held that defendant city was entitled to the immunity granted by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8541. The court found that the dangerous condition of the traffic directional sign, standing alone, did not cause harm to plaintiffs and that defendant city merely facilitated plaintiffs' injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of defendant city's post-trial motion and found that the personal injury claims brought by plaintiffs, victims of car accident, were barred against defendant city by governmental immunity. The court affirmed the judgment entered against defendant driver. The court dismissed the cross-appeal of plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part, concluding that petitioners were not entitled to manufacturing exemptions applicable to the capital stock tax, 72 P.S. &sect; 7602, or the sales and use tax, 72 P.S. &sect; 7201, because their provision of cable television services did not constitute &quot;manufacturing&quot; within the meaning of those sections. The court reversed in part, determining that petitioners were entitled to &quot;processing&quot; exemptions under &sect;&sect; 7602, 7201 because they were engaged in the broadcasting of television programs and they qualified as licensed commercial or educational stations. The court also found that the Board erred when it refused to accept a tax exemption petition that was timely filed under 72 P.S. &sect; 7234, but was filed with the wrong administrative tribunal. By analogy to the rule applicable to civil complaints, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5103, the court held that the Board should have treated the petition as if it was correctly filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Pennsylvania Sunshine Act, 71 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1795.1-1795.14, petitioner school district had filed a petition for review for declaratory relief against respondent Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (board) and teachers' union to enjoin the adjudication of two unfair labor practice charges. It then sought a preliminary injunction and claimed that respondent board no longer existed and had not been constitutionally reestablished. Before the sunset provision became effective the legislature extended the respondent board for one year. Before that year was up the state senate and state legislature by resolution reauthorized the agency. The court denied the preliminary injunction. The court found that 71 P.S. &sect; 1795.7(b), which authorized continuance of an agency by resolution approved in the senate and house was unconstitutional. This in effect, along with an earlier decision that the one-year extension was unconstitutional, rendered the entire law unconstitutional because the legislative intent was no longer expressed in the remaining provisions. Thus, the right to relief was no longer clear, and the preliminary injunction was denied.</SPAN></P>

The court held that two of the six women's complaint would be dismissed because the allegations of sexual misconduct occurred years earlier, and therefore would violate principles of fundamental fairness and due process.

The court also stated that respondent violated the Code of Judicial Conduct by having court-appointed employees engage in partisan political activity with regard to his election.

The New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles electronically reported appellant's conviction to respondent, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing. The report of conviction did not contain the identity of the court, or an identification of the plea, or whether the conviction resulted from a forfeiture of security. Respondent suspended appellant's operating privileges for one-year. Appellant sought review, contending that the compact, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581, was invalid and the report of conviction was not sufficient to support the suspension under the compact. The court reversed, because the report of conviction was deficient and failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the compact; and the December 21, 1998 amendment to the compact, 75 Pa.

The court rejected the Department's claim that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1584 lessened and/or revoked the requirements for reporting an out-of-state conviction. Since a report of defendant's conviction from Ohio failed to include the requisite information in accordance with the driver's license compact, the Department was without basis to suspend appellant's operating privileges.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution then notified defendant that his Pennsylvania driver's license would be suspended for one year pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731. Defendant appealed the suspension, and the trial court sustained defendant's statutory appeal and reinstated his driving privileges. The prosecution then appealed the reinstatement decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit against defendants, manufacturers of diet drugs, asserting a medical monitoring claim. They moved for class certification on behalf of all state residents who used the drugs. In certifying the class as all residents who had used the drugs but who had not been diagnosed with heart disease, the trial court concluded that the class was sufficiently numerous that joinder of all of its members would be impracticable, that common questions of law and fact existed, that the claims raised were typical of those belonging to absent class members, that plaintiffs and their counsel would adequately protect the interests of the class, and that allowing the suit to proceed as a class action would provide a fair and efficient method of adjudication. In excluding from the class those persons who used the drugs and had been diagnosed with heart disease, the trial court concluded that it was proper for the class to include only asymptomatic persons, as including both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons could affect the ability of symptomatic individuals from seeking compensatory damages for injuries caused by defendants' negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court approved consent decrees and final judgments in plaintiff state's suit against defendant tobacco manufacturers, petitioners, a group of hospitals and anti-tobacco organizations, moved to intervene and sought an interpretive opinion regarding whether future claims against the tobacco defendants would be barred or affected by the release provisions in the parties' settlement agreement. In denying the petitions to intervene, the trial court concluded that petitioners sought an interpretive opinion without asserting a claim against the defendants. Because petitioners sought determination of an issue that was not actual, their petition was not ripe, and they failed to present an actual case or controversy. Based upon the long-standing tenet of jurisprudence against providing advisory opinions, the petitions were denied. While the petitioners asserted a right to intervene based upon a legally enforceable interest, the trial court concluded that intervention could not be allowed where the alleged harm was not actual but was, at best, conjectural.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitions to intervene were denied, as the petitioners asserted no claim against the defendants but sought an advisory opinion regarding the effect of the terms of the parties' settlement agreement. Because the petitioners failed to present an actual case or controversy and because there was a long-standing tenet of jurisprudence against providing advisory opinions, intervention could not be permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of rape, statutory assault, indecent assault, and corruption of minors. He was adjudicated a sexual predator under Megan's Law, Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9794(a), and sentenced to prison terms in the aggravated range. In preparation for his direct appeal, defendant submitted two concise statements to the trial court. The first challenged the constitutionality of Megan's Law. The second discussed sufficiency of the evidence and of the court's articulated reasons for imposing sentences in the aggravated range. The court reviewed its own record, and found plentiful evidence, primarily from the victim, supporting defendant's conviction of sex offenses. It also found that it had provided sufficient reasons for sentencing defendant in the aggravated range. Because the court to which defendant would be appealing had recently found the burden of proof provisions of Megan's Law unconstitutional, however, it suggested that the higher court remand for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant licensee sought review of the decision of appellee, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), which suspended his operating privilege under the Driver's License Compact (Compact), 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1581, for a New Jersey conviction for driving under the influence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was arrested for driving while under the influence in New Jersey, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50(a). Thereafter, the Compact became effective. After the licensee was convicted as charged, PennDOT suspended the licensee's operating privilege. On appeal, the court held that the Compact applied to the licensee, regardless of the date of the New Jersey violation, because his New Jersey conviction occurred after the Compact's effective date. The Compact did not operate retrospectively because some predicate facts existed prior to its effective date. Further, &sect; 39:4-50(a) was substantially similar to Pennsylvania's driving under the influence statute,&nbsp;75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a). Moreover, although New Jersey's procedures and penalties for driving under the influenced differed from Pennsylvania's, the issue of substantial similarity related to the substantive elements of the New Jersey and Pennsylvania law, and not to the procedures or penalties for such violations. Finally, any arguments based on N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50(a)(2)(3),(4) were waived. Thus, the licensee's New Jersey conviction was a proper basis for the suspension of his operating privilege by PennDOT.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the licensee's appeal from PennDOT's decision. PennDOT was directed to reinstate the suspension of the licensee's operating privilege.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth invoked the Act, 42 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 9791, for the prescribed mandatory sentence. The court declined to apply the Act. On defendant's challenge, the court held that the procedures provided by 42 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9497, 9799.4 violated defendant's rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. 42 Pa. Const.

Stat. &sect; 9799.4(a) provided for the minimum sentences for sexually violent predators and &sect; 9799.4(c) stated that a subsequent violent sexual offense committed by a sexually violent predator required the imposition of a mandatory life sentence. The court held that 42 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 9497 improperly imposed the burden of clear and convincing evidence on defendant when he challenged the designation. A review of the legislative policy declaration supported the finding that the purpose of the Act was punitive and aimed at retribution.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, he had been receiving a service pension under Plan &quot;D&quot; from his former employment with the city. When the pensioner retired from his position with the district attorney's office, his retirement benefits were required to be suspended if he began to work for the city or any authority established by the city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 22 years old, took a 13-year-old female to a motel room and provided her with alcohol. Temporary impotence caused by intoxication thwarted sexual intercourse. Instead, he penetrated her vagina with his finger. Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated indecent assault, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3525(8), corruption of a minor, and furnishing intoxicants to a minor. He was notified that the assault charge required an assessment by the state sexual offenders assessment board to determine if he was a sexually violent predator. After defendant was so classified, he filed a motion for extraordinary relief, which challenged the constitutionality of Megan's Law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9791 et seq., which required the assessment. He also requested modification of his sentence. The court held that the conviction and sentence for aggravated indecent assault under &sect; 9791 as applied to 18 Pa. Cons.

He was fined on the corruption and alcohol convictions and assessed probation, with the sentences to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner drivers sought review of orders from respondent Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation (DOT), which suspended their Pennsylvania motor vehicle operator's licenses. The drivers contended that the DOT's suspension of operating privileges for one year, following a six-month New Jersey suspension, violated their federal and state constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court held that the holder of a motor vehicle operator's license was not to be deprived of that privilege by arbitrary action of the government. Upon its determination that such an action had occurred, the court granted a reversal of the operating licenses' suspensions. The court found that insofar as the suspensions imposed a punitive sanction substantially greater than that which would have been the case had the suspensions been imposed as concurrent, rather than consecutive to the suspensions of operating privileges in New Jersey or elsewhere, the drivers' constitutional rights had been undermined under the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, the provisions of Articles III and IV of the Driver's License Compact of 1961, 75 Pa. Const. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1581 et seq., had been applied improperly by the DOT, to the prejudice of the drivers. The court therefore directed the DOT to modify the term of the each driver's license suspension to total no more than one-year's suspension pursuant to the statute, as taken together with the out-of-state suspension. Such modifications were to be accomplished immediately.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff customers and defendants, insurers and agents, sought a determination of the applicability of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8371, in the customers lawsuits involving alleged improper sales practices of insurance companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigation involved three general categories of claims: vanishing premiums, replacement transactions, and retirement or savings plans. Defendants alleged that not all of the customers were current customers and that some of them lacked standing to sue, but the court held that the ill effects of the alleged improper sales practices had lasting effects and that the customers were entitled to bring suit. A cause of action did not exist an insurance agent under &sect; 8731. The section applied only where a court could find that an insurer acted in bad faith toward the insured. Defendants were entitled to dismissal of any bad faith claims based on transactions that occurred prior to July 1, 1990, the effective date of &sect; 8371. Section 8371 could not be applied to bad faith conduct occurring prior to its effective date. A &sect; 8371 claim could be raised against an insurance company based on an agent's fraudulent misrepresentations that induced existing policyholders to fund new policies with the policy reserves of their existing policies. Section 8371 was not restricted to lawsuits based on an insurer's failure to pay a claim under a policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that claims based on &sect; 8371 could not be raised against the agents, claims based on &sect; 8371 could not be based on any conduct occurring prior to the effective date of the legislation,&nbsp;&sect; 8371 was not limited to actions for an insurer's failure to pay a claim under a policy, and claims against insurers under &sect; 8371 could be based on alleged misrepresentations occurring during the sale and solicitation of an insurance policy.</SPAN></P>
