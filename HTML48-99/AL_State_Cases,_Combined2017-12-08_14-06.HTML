The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the ordinance was invalid. The court found that the only conceivable purpose for fixing the annual license fee at $ 5,000 was to totally prohibit the sale of beer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former inmate challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Alabama), which ruled in favor of respondent city, declared that a local law providing for punishments, Ala. Code &sect; 1567, was constitutional, and dismissed the inmate's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted in the recorder's court for the commission of misdemeanors arising out of a single transaction. His sentences were suspended, and he was placed on probation. Two months later, he was tried and convicted in the recorder's court for the commission of other misdemeanors arising from transactions other than those made the basis of his first convictions. His probation was revoked, and the suspended sentences were put into effect. The inmate then filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. The inmate next filed a complaint seeking declaratory judgment that &sect; 1567 was unconstitutional. On review, the court declared the appeal to be moot because the inmate had been released from custody. There was no question that at the time the inmate filed the suit there existed, between him and the city, a justiciable controversy involving &sect; 1567. However, by the time the appeal was taken under submission by the court, he had been discharged from custody. Because the appeal was not necessary and the case was moot, the court dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals (Alabama) to review and revise its decision to deny defendant's writ of habeas corpus and its judgment denying defendant bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on a charge of setting off explosives near a dwelling house in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 123. The magistrate issuing the warrant failed to set bail. Defendant argued that bail should have been granted because there were no longer any &quot;capital offenses&quot; in the state, as the United States Supreme Court decision in Furman declared the death penalty unconstitutional as it was then enforced. The court agreed with the majority view that offenses that were classified capital before Furman were still capital, thereby allowing bail to be constitutionally denied for those offenses. The gravity of the offense was the distinguishing feature and not the penalty that might be imposed in determining whether a crime was capital. However, the court found that the quality of proof against defendant was insufficient to approve bail. The court held that even with the corroborated statement of a coconspirator, the &quot;proof is evident or presumption great&quot; test was not met. The court held that the presumption of conviction for the crime, and the imposition of the maximum allowable sentence, was not so great as to comport with the constitutional exception for the denial of bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment denying defendant bail and directed that defendant be released from custody upon his furnishing bail.</SPAN></P>

Board), beer and wine association, retail association, and attorney general, to dismiss the residents' action to declare legislative acts unconstitutional and void under Ala. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acts permitted the sale of &quot;table wines&quot; by grocery stores and supermarkets in three counties. These wines were sold in &quot;wet&quot; counties only at A.B.C. Board stores. The residents, who did not reside in one of the three counties, attempted to show injury based on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss. The court affirmed. The court did not find any injury under their claim that the state denied them special privileges, which were given to citizens of three other counties. The residents alleged that the profits earned by the state through A.B.C. Board wine sales constituted a tax not required of citizens buying wine in the three counties. The court did not find this argument persuasive. The court was not convinced that the profit was a tax. The court held that the residents, who showed no injury and no expectation of benefit if the acts were voided, did not have standing to present the question of constitutionality. The court found no facts or positions to show standing. The court concluded that the residents could not prove a set of facts on which to base standing to pray for the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's injuries resulted proximately from the alleged negligence of the steel corporation. The wife sought damages for the loss of her husband's consortium. The trial court granted the corporation's dismissal motion, holding that a wife had no cause of action under Alabama's common law for the loss of consortium resulting from a third party's tortious act. The court reversed the trial court's decision and held that Ala. Code tit. 1, &sect; 3 reflected an invitation for change and growth in the common law of Alabama. Further, certain provisions of the Alabama constitution appeared to invite a wife's loss of consortium cause of action. Thus, nothing in tit. 1, &sect; 3 (1940) necessitated the conclusion that a wife had no claim for loss of consortium. Moreover, the continuing denial of a wife's consortium action was not required when precedent was no longer supported by contemporary knowledge. Finally, the potential for double recovery was remote because a spouse could not maintain a consortium action when the other spouse had already obtained damages for such loss. The court held that in Alabama, each spouse had a loss consortium claim based upon a tortious act of a third party.</SPAN></P>

The owner had a license from the city to operate a service station and did not apply for a grocery license or mini-mart license.

The city refused to issue a license to the owner for the sale of beer. The owner brought an action for mandamus, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and declaratory judgment. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the city. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance, Lipscomb, Ala., Ordinance No. 183, in question was not invalid for vagueness or ambiguity. It was not error for the trial court to find that the service station was within three city blocks of a church because the finding was supported by a witness of the owner, the general manager of the owner's corporation, who said that the service station was approximately a block and a half from a church.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first ordinance purported to effect an amendment to the water board's charter and proclaimed that the city desired to increase from three to five the number of directors of the water board and then ordained that the water board's charter was ipso facto amended to provide for such increase. The second ordinance purported to mandate the transfer of the water system owned by the water board to a newly created board under conditions which would have resulted in the diversion of a fixed percentage of the gross revenues from such water system to the city. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the first ordinance represented an unlawful assertion of power over the water board by the city because the governing body of the city could not, in violation of the water board's charter, unilaterally increase the number of directors of the water board for the purpose of immediately gaining a majority of directors who would be responsive to the will of the governing body.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ordinance 69-75 awarded a privilege to the city's contract wrecker service, allowing it to monitor by short ban radio the police department's calls for automobile accidents. The other wrecker services in the city were not allowed to monitor the police radio. The wrecker service filed a declaratory judgment action asserting that the city had created one set of regulations for its contract service, and another set for all other wrecker services, violating the equal protection privileges of the Fourteenth Amendment and Ala. Const. &sect; 22 (1901). The wrecker service asserted that it should have been permitted to maintain a short wave radio for the monitoring of police calls in the same manner and to the same extent as the contract wrecker service.The court held that Birmingham, Ala., City Ordinance No. 69-75 was constitutional because the city had a legitimate purpose in allowing its contract service to monitor calls: to allow it to head to the scene of the accident and expedite clearance of the city's streets. However, under the ordinance, no services, including the city's contract service, could &quot;chase wrecks&quot; and go to the scene of an accident before being summoned by police.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 42(c) (1940).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant title insurance company issued commitments for title insurance including descriptions of the estate to be covered by the policies preliminary to the issuance of the policies themselves. Appellee state alleged that appellant had rendered opinions of title as to the described real property and that this action was the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 42(c) (1940). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, but on appeal, the court reversed, holding that the commitments prepared by appellant, when read in their entirety, merely specified the estate to be covered in a title policy to be later issued. The court found that these commitments fell short of a title opinion, which included a analysis of the recorded instruments as they might have affected the claim of title down to a present owner. Thus, by looking at the entire instrument, the court concluded that appellant's activities did not constitute an intrusion into the practice of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated an adult bookstore. As a result of a magazine sale, he was indicted for selling hard-core pornography. A jury found him guilty and imposed a fine. The trial court imposed an additional punishment of hard labor. The court of criminal appeals affirmed the judgment. The court granted defendant's writ of certiorari and affirmed the conviction. Defendant's expert testified that the magazine did not appeal predominately to a prurient interest in sex or nudity and that the magazine had redeeming social value. From the verdict rendered, the court inferred that the jury attached little or no weight to the expert's testimony. The court found no reason to question the conclusion of the jury. Although one section of the obscenity statute under which defendant was convicted was held unconstitutional by a federal district court, the court held that 1969 Ala. Acts 698 in all parts other than Ala. Code &sect; 374(16m) was clear and unambiguous. The remaining portions sufficiently defined what was pornographic as to fully warn anyone of what was prohibited activity. The unconstitutional provision was severable from the remainder of the statute, which was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies filed two actions against appellants to obtain injunctions against the enforcement of Ala. Code &sect; 89 (1971), a criminal statute that specified the maximum weights for vehicles traveling on Alabama highways. The trial court ruled that there had been a sudden and strict enforcement of the truck weight laws and that this was inequitable, unfair, and unconstitutional. It issued an injunction against appellants to restrain them from arresting or prosecuting any drivers of vehicles for violating the statute. Appellants sought review, and the court reversed the judgment. The court determined that there was no implied repeal of the truck weight statute by the enactment of Ala. Code &sect; 697 because &sect; 697 did not specifically authorize weights in excess of the limits set forth in the truck weight statute but merely taxed trucks according to their declared weights. Thus, the issuance of a license under &sect; 697 did not bar the state from constitutionally prosecuting drivers under the truck weight statute. The court ruled that the mere nonenforcement of the statute over a period of time did not act to repeal the statute and that there was no unconstitutional entrapment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee beneficiary filed for probate the purported will of the testator. The contestants contested the will. Over the contestants' objection, the trial court struck a jury of six members as provided for by 1971 Ala. Acts. 1734, as amended by 1971 Ala. Acts 189. Following a verdict in favor of the beneficiary, the contestants appealed. The court reversed the judgment and held that the act allowing for a six-person jury was unconstitutional insofar as it applied to cases in which the right of trial by jury was preserved inviolate by the state's constitution. Because there had always been a right to trial by jury in a will contest, the provision in the state constitution of 1876, that the right of trial by jury remained inviolate, had to have been considered as perpetuating the right in cases in which, at the date of its adoption, it had been universally recognized and firmly established, as in will contests. Therefore, the right to trial by jury in a will contest fell within the protection of Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, and the legislature could not have abridged or limited the substance of that right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission argued that the circuit court did not possess inherent or statutory power under Ala. Code tit. 13, &sect; 125 (28a), to order them to put into effect the salary schedule fixed by the judges. The court agreed, maintaining that under the separation of powers doctrine the authority to appropriate public monies was centralized in the legislative branch. Therefore the court held that the circuit court erred in ordering the commission to put into effect the salaries scale set for clerical staff in the judges' proposed budget. The circuit court argued that its action was warranted by tit. 13, &sect; 125 which authorized them to fix clerical salaries. The court disagreed finding that the true intent of the legislature was to place the final approval in the commission as the party responsible for appropriating public monies. The court agreed with the commission that the circuit judges could not be considered impartial arbiters as their natural tendency would have been to create bias in favor of the correctness of their salary recommendations.

Plaintiff minor was injured in an elevator accident 10 years later, and the minor, by his next friend, brought a negligence action against the company. The company filed a motion that requested the general affirmative charge that the action was barred by the provisions of Ala. Code tit. 7, &sect; 23(1) (1969), which provided that no tort action could be brought against persons who designed or installed improvements to realty more than seven years after their final completion. The trial court denied the motion and the company appealed. The court held that: (1) Ala. Const. &sect; 45 (1901) limited legislation to a single subject and required that the subject be clearly expressed in the title; (2) the title of &sect; 23(1) purported to establish a traditional statute of limitations, a procedural right, but the act also abolished a substantive right, and violated the constitutional provision; and (3) the statute conflicted with the traditional rule that tolled the period of limitations until the minor was free of legal disability to bring an action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared at the door of an apartment that was being searched pursuant to a search warrant. The warrant did not name defendant and defendant was unknown to the executing officers. He was fully searched by the officers and drug evidence was found in his back pocket. The appellate court reversed his conviction, after finding that the search of defendant was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the search of defendant, who was not named or described in the warrant but came onto the premises being searched, was not made lawful simply by his presence at the apartment. Although they could have conducted a pat down of defendant under Terry, if they had been concerned for their safety, the law required that the officers have probable cause to believe that defendant had himself participated in criminal activity before they could search him. No probable cause existed to justify defendant's search, he was not named in the warrant nor did the officers know him, and nothing in defendant's appearance or conduct indicated his involvement in any crime.</SPAN></P>

The governor desired to appoint an individual to the position of circuit judge; however, that individual was the cousin of the governor's wife and, therefore, within the prohibited degree of affinity. The court concluded that the legislature had no authority to restrict by statute the qualifications for circuit judges stated in the Alabama Constitution or to impair the right of appointment of judges granted in the Constitution.

The wife filed a bill of review and an application for a rehearing, claiming that the husband knew her address because he sent two letters to her residence during the divorce proceedings. The trial court overruled the bill of review and denied the application for a rehearing.

The wife contended that the husband committed perjury because he knew her residence all along.

A cellmate testified that while he and defendant were locked up together, defendant told him the full story of the assault and rape. Defendant himself took the stand and denied everything. The jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged and imposed a 24-year penitentiary sentence. The court affirmed and held that defendant was tried on a valid indictment and that the confession was made to a cellmate and was admitted after a proper predicate had been laid to as its voluntariness. There was no evidence that any officer was present or heard the confession or that the cellmate was an undercover agent of any officer. Thus, the court held that there was no &quot;poisonous tree&quot; and no &quot;fruit&quot; of any illegal search or seizure or custodial interrogation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The movie distributor, a California corporation, rented films to Alabama television stations for broadcast. The revenue commissioner levied a privilege tax upon the movie distributor as one engaged in the business of renting tangible personal property. The movie distributor filed an action to prevent the revenue commissioner from imposing the tax. The lower court held that the movie distributor was not subject to the tax because the movie distributor was not doing business in Alabama and because the films were not tangible personal property. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's decree. The court determined that the films were tangible personal property despite the movie distributor's assertion that the contracts contemplated the transfer of an intangible right to publish. The court held that every rental of personal property necessarily carried with it the right to use that property for its intended purpose. Alabama had the power to levy a tax upon an activity before or after its movement in interstate commerce. The transferring possession of the films to the Alabama television stations following its shipment through interstate commerce was a local taxable event.</SPAN></P>

XIV, &sect; 263 because the cumulative impact of the relationship between the State and the religious schools as contemplated by Ala. H.B. 247 would constitute an excessive entanglement with religion and thus, be unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause. The court found that for Ala. H.B. 247 to pass constitutional muster under the Establishment Clause, it had to have a secular purpose; its primary effect had to neither advance nor inhibit religion; and it could not foster an excessive entanglement with religion. The court found that providing state aid to religious schools contravened the Establishment Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controversy involved the retirement system provided by the ordinance to provide retirement allowances for employees of the City under alternative options of equivalent actuarial value. Appellee's deceased husband elected to receive option number two which allowed him to draw modified retirement benefits and his named beneficiary, appellee, to receive a reduced retirement allowance for her life if the retired member died. Appellant denied appellee any benefits except a return of her late husband's contributions. The court held that the trial court could have found that as the retirement system was set up, i.e., with the 30-day clause, if an employee died within the 30-day period, a gain or windfall would have resulted to the advantage of the City. The trial court had the right under the evidence to find that the procedure provided by the ordinance was unduly oppressive and prohibitive, in view of the readily available alternative of a waiting period before, rather than after the retirement date. The trial court was not plainly erroneous in its findings that the 30-day clause following the effective retirement date was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The property owners disapproved of the rezoning so commenced an action. The trial court dismissed the property owners' complaint. The property owners appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held the final decree of the trial court upheld the validity and constitutionality of the zoning ordinance and did recognize that the action of the commission was not arbitrary and capricious. The court determined the trial court was not required to expressly state a declaration of the rights of the parties in the final decree. The court held there was no requirement that the commission conduct a study before it made its decision even though studies had been undertaken. The court ruled procedural due process was followed because there were extensive debates before the rezoning was ordered. The court held that the decision of the commission was not arbitrary and capricious. The court ruled that there could not have been any spot zoning when there was a comprehensive plan. The court ruled that the property owners did not have a legal right to insist that zoning classifications remain unchanged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover agent who was acquainted with defendant informed defendant that he wished to buy a pound of marijuana.

The court held that the Act did not violate the single subject clause, which provided that each law was to contain but one subject that was to be clearly expressed in its title. The Act was divided into five parts dealing with, inter alia, definitions, manufacturing, distribution, offenses and penalties, and enforcement. The component subjects combined into the grand and comprehensive subject of the regulation of controlled substances, and the title of the Act included all the component parts. The court applied four principles to determine that the classification of marijuana as a hard drug was valid. The Act imposed a single range of punishment for selling different controlled substances; the legislature could properly punish sales of marijuana equally with the sale of other controlled substances; and the Act was not subject to attack on the grounds of arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was sentenced to death for a rape offense, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari review and mandated out the death sentence. The question presented on remand to the court was whether defendant was entitled to a new trial on the issue of punishment only. The dissenting justices argued that a new trial was necessary because the possible punishment could have varied from a minimum of 10 years up to any number of years of imprisonment in the penitentiary pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 395 (1940). The court held however that a new trial was not necessary and it modified the sentence of the circuit court to reflect the imposition of a life sentence. The court reasoned that neither statutory nor common law power existed in Alabama authorizing such a bifurcated jury trial. The court considered numerous factors, including the safety of the public and the efficiency of conducting a new trial and determined that under the particular circumstances of the case, it was appropriate to correct the sentence to impose a life sentence in lieu of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal was originally hired as a principal and held that post for three successful years in the same system. He opposed his transfer by the board to the position of teacher and coach in another high school in the county.

The court held that the legislature intended in the 1951 amendment to &sect; 352 that any principal or supervisor could attain continuing service status after three years of successful service in the position in a system. However, at the same time, if the principal or supervisor had previously attained continuing service status in that system as an instructor, he would not lose the status as an instructor even if he were not successful as a principal or supervisor. The court further held that the action of the Board was not &quot;null and void&quot; and that the transfer was allowed under &sect; 355, provided that it was &quot;without loss of status or violation of contract&quot; and that the &quot;status&quot; applied to continuing service, basic salary, and not to the same position in another school.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment in part. The court held that 1969 Ala. Acts 1178 was valid because it impliedly repealed the last clause of 1947 Ala. Acts 344, &sect; 4. The court held that 1969 Ala. Acts 1177 was void because it did not provide a procedure for the residents to have notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the rezoning, in accordance with the requirements of due process of law.

The corporation contended that the commissioner's denial to issue a license to operate a movie theater on the conjecture, without proof, that it might exhibit obscene pictures, imposed a prior restraint on the freedom of expression in contravention of Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 and U.S. Const. amend. I. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment for the commissioner and concluded that the burden of proof was on the corporation to show that the application of the city ordinance was construed and applied in such an arbitrary manner as to violate its constitutional rights under the First Amendment. The court held that the corporation had failed to carry its burden of proof and the court had to accept the commissioner's answer to the petition for mandamus as being correct, including the statement that the issuance of the license would be contrary to the public safety. The court ruled that it could not take judicial notice of whether certain films the corporation intended to show were harmful to the public safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed a bill of complaint for a declaratory judgment, alleging that Act No. 1170, Acts of Alabama p. 2179 (1969) (Act), which provided that sheriffs be compensated by an annual salary, was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the Act was constitutional when freed of its unconstitutional exceptions by use of the Act's severability provision. The court affirmed, determining that certain exceptions in &sect; 2 of the Act were unconstitutional because each exception pertained to only one county and these constituted local laws that were not advertised as required by Ala. Const. &sect; 106 (1901). The provisions of the Act remaining after severance of the unconstitutional exceptions constituted a valid legislative enactment where the legislature intended the Act to be severable. The court held that the Act was not rendered unconstitutional as violating either Ala. Const. &sect; 281 (1901) or Ala. Const. amend. 92 (1901), but that those constitutional provisions prevented any changes in sheriffs' salaries until the beginning of the next succeeding term following a reclassification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county commission, sought review of the judgment of a trial court (Alabama), which ruled that appellee, a circuit judge for the county who filed a petition for mandamus, was to be paid $ 15,164.50 in supplemental salary by the commission. The commission claimed that the payment violated Ala. Const. amend. 92, that a judge's salary could not be increased, and that legislative acts authorizing salary increases were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was elected to fill an unexpired term of a judge who resigned from a two-county circuit, and was reelected; the Legislature divided the circuit into two. At trial, the judge claimed that he was entitled to the salary increase pursuant to several acts of the Legislature. On review, the court found that legislation was presumptively constitutional, that Ala. Const. amend. 92 was not violated by the creation of a one-county circuit, and that the judge was entitled to such supplemental salary if it was legally paid to other judges similarly situated. The court ruled that the judge actually served one term that was part of the &quot;unexpired term&quot; provided for in Ala. Const. &sect; 158, and as the successor chosen at election he continued to hold the office for the unexpired term until the new election. The court found that it was error to grant him a pay increase for a five-year term, that as a state official he was entitled to a supplement of $ 3,600 for each of three years, and that Ala. Const. &sect; 106 had no application to the acts creating a new circuit. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court as to the county supplement due for three years, and reversed the judgment in part where it stated that the judge was entitled to an increased supplement for three years or for any county supplement after an act's effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tobacco wholesaler filed an action to enjoin the commissioner from revoking or failing to renew its license as a tobacco wholesaler. The trial court granted the injunction and the commissioner appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the tobacco wholesaler had not sold cigarettes below its actual cost with intent to injure competitors and destroy or substantially lessen competition. The court found that the tobacco wholesaler actually sold a carton of cigarettes for a few cents more than its cost to the tobacco wholesaler. The court determined that the tobacco wholesaler was not required to include as an item of cost the full face value of the tax stamps because they did not pay the full face value of the stamps. The court held that the cost to the tobacco wholesaler was the actual cost and not a theoretical or fictitious cost based upon discounts which the tobacco wholesaler received for prompt payment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled in favor of appellees, and on appeal the court affirmed because (1) the municipality was not amending the zoning ordinance through &quot;contract zoning&quot; because the only evidence of such was a letter dated more than four months after the adoption of the ordinance; (2) the zoning ordinance was not vague in its terms in defining a parkway and even if it was, the landowners were not in a position to be injured by such vagueness; (3) the rezoning of the land did not amount to &quot;spot&quot; zoning when the comprehensive plan of the municipality was considered as the other nonconforming land uses in the vicinity were a mall and a proposed parkway; and, (4) the contention that the municipality did not follow statutory procedure in enacting the ordinance was groundless as the ordinance was reduced to writing and read in its entirety as required by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ABC Board notified the employee that he was dismissed from his position. A hearing before the State Personnel Board was scheduled. However, before such hearing could be held, the employee filed an action for declaratory judgment to enjoin the ABC Board from dismissing him. The trial court issued a final decree against appellants. On appeal, the court found that under Title 55, &sect; 300, Code of Alabama (recompiled 1958), the Personnel Board could have adopted rules, not inconsistent with the laws of the state, to give effect to the provisions and purposes of the Merit System Act and that those rules would have the force and effect of the law if they did not conflict with state law. The court held that the plain language of the Personnel Board's rule for dismissals did not conflict with Tit. 55, &sect; 315, Code of Alabama (recompiled 1958) relating to dismissals because both contemplated the dismissal of an employee before any hearing on the charges. Because the statute was valid, the rule was valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient brought suit against defendant doctor alleging that a &quot;bulldog&quot; clamp was left in his body during an operation performed by the doctor. The complaint was filed almost four years after the surgery and stated counts for breach of contract, trespass, and assault and battery. The jury found for the doctor, and the trial court (Alabama) entered judgment accordingly. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's main argument was directed at a portion of the trial court's oral charge wherein the trial court instructed the jury that if the jury was reasonably satisfied from the evidence that the leaving of the clamp in the patient's body was unintentional, that the two year statute of limitation would apply and their verdict would be for the doctor. The evidence was clear to the conclusion that the cause of action was governed by the two-year statute of limitation. The charge of assault and battery was based on nothing more than that the bulldog clamp was left in his body during the operation. Any error resulting from the charge would be harmless. The patient did not file his action within the period required by 1953 Ala. Acts 766. The substance of the action unquestionably was for malpractice. Such actions, whether sounding in contract or tort, were controlled by the limitations spelled out in the Act. The Act was a valid classification created pursuant to the inherent power of the legislature. The two-year time limit in which to bring actions for malpractice was not so arbitrary or unreasonable as to be violative of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county commission members sought to overturn the order of a circuit court (Alabama), which required the members to pay an increased salary to appellee solicitor pursuant to the Act of Sept. 13, 1969, No. 1176, 1969 Ala. Acts 2193.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the solicitor was serving a six-year term of office, the court with which he was serving was abolished by Act No. 1176. The new replacement court was very similar to the abolished court, and the solicitor's salary was raised in his position with the new court. The county commission members objected to the increased salary on the ground that Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 68, 281 (1901) and Ala. Const. amend. 92 prohibited salary increases during the solicitor's term of office. The lower court issued a writ of mandamus requiring the county commission members to pay the solicitor, and the court affirmed the lower court's order. The court held that the county commission members had the burden of clearly establishing the invalidity of the legislation raising the solicitor's salary and that they had failed to do so. The court ruled that the abolishment of the old court was not merely a pretext because new provisions were added to the Act which changed the manner in which the new court was to function as compared to the old court.</SPAN></P>

The Lee County Circuit Court (Alabama) denied appellants relief and decreed that appellees were legally liable for the privilege license fee or occupation as imposed by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the trial court judgment that denied them relief and held that the ordinance that imposed an occupation and privilege tax was legal and enforceable. Appellants argued that the city's imposition of the tax was a burden on or an interference with government because the taxed individuals were performing essential functions for the operation of the government. The court determined that the imposition of the tax or license fee on the individual appellants did not place a tax burden on the governmental entities that employed them. The tax was not levied on the employer-employee relationship, but on the taxable event of rendering services, following a trade, business, or profession. The ordinance placed the tax on appellants' privilege of working within the city limits, regardless of the employer or the place of residence. The court concluded that the ordinance was constitutional and valid because it applied to civil employees who performed services in the city limits, and was not an income tax.</SPAN></P>

Commission members inspected the property and recommended against rezoning. The Commission then called a public hearing at which the residents, neighborhood property owners, opposed the petition. After the hearing, the Commission recommended that the petition be denied. However, the County convened in special session and granted the petition. The court opined that the trial judge could find, from the testimony, that the recommendations of the Commission were received by the County. The court rejected the residents' contention that the decision of the County was arbitrary and capricious, constituting spot zoning. The court pointed out the strong presumption in favor of the trial court's findings where evidence was taken ore tenus, and the court would not say that those findings were plainly and palpably wrong and unjust. The court noted that no authority was cited by the residents for their assertions. The court concluded that nothing required the County to reach a decision during a public meeting.</SPAN></P>

The court held that these statutes did not require any notice to the person alleged to have been insane, before the order of commitment was signed. The court reasoned that the order of commitment settled nothing finally or conclusively against the patient. The court held that the patient was entitled to institute judicial proceedings under the statutes, to determine the necessity and propriety of his confinement. The court held that because the patient had the right at any time to proceed to a trial of his present sanity, he was not confined without due process of law, and the trial court did not err in refusing to order his discharge from the hospital.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alabama House of Representatives propounded two questions to the Justices of the Alabama Supreme Court. The first sought an opinion as to whether H.B. 1077 conflicted in any way with Ala. Const. amend. LXXIII. The second was whether H.B. 1077 conflicted with the provision in Ala. Const. amend. LXXIII that granted the county governing body of Jefferson County the sole authority to fix sewer service charges in Jefferson County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purpose of H.B. 1077 was to delete from 1949 Ala. Acts 619 the provisions that where a service charge was based upon the consumption of water alone, such service charge should not exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of the water bill rendered with respect to the property involved. There were also proposed amendments to H.B. 1077, which were both designed to restrict the governing body of Jefferson County as to the rates and charges that it could exact for the use of the sewerage system. The court held that H.B. 1077 did not offend Ala. Const. amend. LXXIII because H.B. 1077 did not actually restrict or alter the provisions of Ala. Const. amend. LXXIII, which amendment by its terms was self-executing. The proposed amendments to H.B. 1077 ran counter to Ala. Const. amend. LXXIII and, therefore, were unconstitutional because Ala. Const. amend. LXXIII gave to the governing body of Jefferson County alone the power and authority to adopt reasonable and nondiscriminatory rules and regulations fixing rates and charges for the use of the sewerage system and that the Alabama Legislature could not dictate to the county governing body in regard to the amount of such rates and charges.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that there was no legal duty and no ministerial act involved in the failure to reinstate a revocable permit for ingress and egress over the proposed road that was sought by the landowner. In addition, the landowner had no legal right to any established right of way which could be enforced against the State of Alabama. Accordingly, he had no right which could be protected by injunction. The court held that no official duty was unperformed, no ministerial act was involved, the constitutionality of no statute was involved, and no legal duty by any official was shown to be owed to the landowner.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Alabama Constitution reiterated the right of the sovereign to take property by means of eminent domain over the property of corporations as well as individuals as long as there was just compensation, that the right could be extended to private entities for certain purposes, and that the courts were not to interfere with the legislature's determination as to who had the right of eminent domain. The Alabama legislature had historically approved and encouraged the industrial development of Alabama. The use of the proposed pipeline was in the furtherance of industrial development in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the circuit court granting the oil company the right of eminent domain over the property of the landowners for the construction of a pipeline and holding that the statute granting the oil company the power of eminent domain was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Crenshaw County (Alabama) held that the Act was constitutional, and the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer challenged the validity of the Act, which authorized the establishment of public corporations having the power to cooperate with and lend financial assistance and other aid to municipalities, communities, counties, industries and public and private corporations in matters and undertakings pertaining to the control, abatement or prevention of water, air, or general environmental pollution. The public corporations were empowered by the Act to issue revenue bonds and to construct, acquire and lease equipment, facilities and systems in connection with the overall purposes of combating ecological damage. Following the reasoning of the trial court, the court held that the Act was valid and did not violate the raised constitutional provisions. Specifically, prohibitions contained in Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 93, 94, 213, 45, 42, 43, and 44 were complied with and the Act was not in violation of any of the sections. Several of the prohibitions in the sections were directed toward the state and not to public corporations and were therefore inapplicable. The court relied on the separate entity concept in its decision to uphold the Act as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was identified by the victim from a photo line-up and arrested. He was convicted of rape and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed. The court held that (1) defendant had failed to establish racial discrimination in the composition of the jury roll returning the indictment; (2) the sentence of death for rape was not an unconstitutional sentence in that it did not amount to a cruel and unusual punishment; and (3) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a reduction of sentence. The trial court failed to further question four veniremen who indicated that they did not &quot;believe&quot; in capital punishment. The trial court simply dismissed them. Each venireman must be further examined to sufficiently show that he would automatically vote against the imposition of the death penalty no matter what the evidence introduced at the trial might reveal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation, a seller of advertising specialties, was incorporated in Texas. Upon accepting in Texas an order for specialties, the corporation told the manufacturer to ship the goods directly to the buyer; the manufacturer billed the corporation. The buyers paid the corporation, which paid commissions to the salesmen in the various states, including Alabama. The corporation sought judicial review of the department's use tax assessment and prevailed at the trial level, but the decision was reversed. The corporation petitioned for a writ of certiorari, and the court affirmed the lower appellate court's judgment. The court held that the corporation came within the intent of Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 792(c) (1940). The corporation's salesmen were just as much its representatives as if they were salaried employee salesmen. Section 792(c) required simply solicitation of orders for the seller by persons within the state who were characterized as &quot;agents or salesmen.&quot; Neither the absence of written contracts nor the absence of assigned territories resulted in changing the local function of solicitation nor bore upon the salesmen's effectiveness in securing a flow of goods into Alabama.</SPAN></P>

The state oil and gas board argued that the trial court erred because upon such a challenge to the validity of any rule, regulation, or order, the presumption was that the order was prima facie valid. The court reversed and remanded the judgment invalidating the pooling unit enlargement order, concluding that the reversal and remand was erroneous because reviewing courts did not make independent determinations of the matters before an administrative authority. The court observed that the trial court lacked the power to make findings or to annul an administrative finding of fact on the ground that the evidence warranted a contrary finding. The court observed that the appropriate judicial inquiry was limited to ascertaining whether evidence supported the findings. The court concluded that the record was replete with evidence that established that the unit enlargement order met the applicable statutory requirements and was not made in a manner that deprived the contiguous tractowners or others due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was no evidence that the jury was not drawn from a fair cross section of the community and, therefore, defendant failed to meet the burden of proof cast upon him to establish discrimination. The court further held the Alabama case that held that the statute excluding woman from jury service was unconstitutional was decided after defendant's trial and conviction and that the decision was not retroactive. The court further found defendant did not present evidence that the general public in the county where the trial occurred was so adverse that he could not receive a fair trial.

Defendant was convicted of the rape and sentenced to death. Subsequently, a legal intern from the NAACP examined the county's court files to ascertain the number of African-Americans appearing on the jury venires from 1950 to 1962, the year defendant was found guilty. Defendant, in his writ of error coram nobis sought to introduce the data into evidence. The trial court denied the writ. The court affirmed the judgment and held that a writ of error coram nobis did not lie to permit defendant to review an alleged error because the error allegedly grew out of matters already litigated and adjudicated on their merits. When the effort was undertaken to produce evidence disputing evidence produced in the trial relative to the exclusion of African-Americans from the juries in the county, the matter had already been fully and finally litigated. The trial court properly rejected the data produced by the legal intern, and the statistical study made thereon. The court also held that Alabama law did not preclude the same jury that convicted defendant from sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the litigation was pending at the time the Act went into effect, that the Act was remedial in nature and applied to matters of form and not substance, and that a retrospective application of the Act did not affect any vested right of respondents. The court also held that the retrospective application of the Act did not violate Ala.

The issue before the court was whether a certain act of the legislature violated the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The dispute arose as a result of the church splitting into two churches. The members of the parent church contended they were entitled to the land at issue because the church trustees held it in trust. The former parishioners contended that pursuant to Act No. 79, Ala. Code tit. 58, &sect;&sect; 104-113, they were entitled to possession and ownership of the land. The parent church contended there was insufficient evidence to support the finding of the trial court. The court reversed and remanded, determining that the challenge to the sufficiency of evidence was not properly set forth, therefore it deemed the challenge waived. The court concluded that Act No. 79 transferred control of the parent church's property from the hierarchy to a majority composed of 65 percent or more of the adult members of the parent church. The court determined that Act. No. 79 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The property owner challenged appellants' determination that his building was non-conforming. The Housing Board of Adjustments and Appeals affirmed appellants' determination. The landowner's further appeal was dismissed and he brought this declaratory judgment action. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment and held that Ordinance No. 3227 was constitutional. The court held that the ordinance was properly enacted within the city's police powers to promote the public welfare. The court further found that the ordinance provided for, and the property owner received, notice of the defects in his building. In addition, the court found that the ordinance provided for appeals of appellants' determination to the Housing Board of Adjustments and Appeals; the ordinance also provided that the Board's decisions were subject to such remedies that were available at law or in equity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1967 Ala. Acts 345 &sect; 8, imposed a tax on the gross premium receipts on all fire, lightning, extended coverage, inland marine, allied lines and windstorm insurance policies written during a calendar year, payable to the state fire fighters' pension fund. 1967 Ala. Acts 345 &sect; 8, also provided that knowing or willful failure to pay the tax would result in the state's immediate revocation of the delinquent's license to do business in the state. Appellee insurance company contended that 1967 Ala. Acts 345 &sect; 8, violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it permitted revocation of an insurance company's license with no provision for a right to hearing. The court agreed that 1967 Ala. Acts 345 &sect; 8, provided for no notice or opportunity to be heard, since it made no provision for an administrative hearing, or for judicial review of the acts of the state, and affirmed the trial court's judgment that 1967 Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant's only evidence in support of his insanity defense was a psychiatrist's opinion that defendant had paranoid tendencies but the probability of paranoia did not effect his ability to distinguish between right and wrong. Defendant was convicted of burglary in the first degree with the intent to ravish and was sentenced to life imprisonment, and sought review. The court held that: (1) burglary, like trespass, was an offense against the possession and the test to determine in whom the ownership of the premises should be laid in an indictment was not the title but the occupancy or possession at the time the offense was committed; (2) the state made a prima facie case and the trial judge properly allowed the case to go to a jury to consider all the circumstances and evidence; (3) the question of intent was always a jury question; (4) defendant was sane and competent to stand trial under Alabama law; and (5) defendant had a motion to quash the indictment based on the same grounds as his subsequent motion to dismiss the indictment, and no new grounds were shown or federal or state constitutional rights shown to have been violated.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that at the time of assessment, the corporation was defunct and insolvent and that the corporate shares were without actual value. The taxpayer argued that they were not individually assessed the tax and that the collection of tax without assessment deprived them of due process of law. The court rejected the argument and affirmed the judgment. It reasoned that the corporate assessment, which was not appealed, was valid and binding on the individual shareholders and that the insolvency of the corporation to pay the tax did not relieve the individual shareholder of liability for tax on his individually held shares. Notice to the corporation, given as required by the statute, satisfied the requirement for notice to the stockholders and further notice to the individual stockholders was not necessary. The statute, Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 25 (1940), made the corporation agent for the stockholders in the matter of assessment of tax on the respective shares of the stockholders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning commissioner denied the landowners' application to use their property for the removal of chert, stone, clay, coal, iron, and other ores on grounds that the zoning regulation they cited did not apply to the permanent quarrying operation they proposed. The zoning commissioner advised that their proposed use came under provisions dealing with mining and quarrying, uses not permitted under their land's zoning classification. They sought review of the denial by mandamus, contending that because their application was couched in the terms of the zoning resolution, the denial of their permit raised a legal question only. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the petition because the landowners had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The denial of their permit was not solely a legal question because the zoning administrator had not construed the zoning resolution, he had used his discretion to determine the facts and the applicability of those facts to the appropriate provisions of the zoning resolution. Mandamus was not the proper remedy because the landowners had another adequate remedy; they could seek review by the zoning adjustment board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously held that the Alabama Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, 1951 Ala.

The original act provided that it was unlawful for any wholesaler or retailer, with intent to injure competitors, to destroy or substantially lessen competition, to advertise, offer to sell, or sell at wholesale or retail cigarettes at less than cost to such wholesaler or retailer. The amended act provided that it was unlawful for any wholesaler or retailer with intent to injure competitors, destroy or substantially lessen competition, or with the effect thereof, to advertise, offer to sell or sell at wholesale or retail cigarettes at less than cost to such wholesaler or retailer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only question raised was whether the receipts from the rental of bowling shoes by the taxpayer were a part of the &quot;gross receipts&quot; of the bowling alley, subject to the tax levied under &sect; 786(3)(b), Title 51, Code of Ala. Recompiled 1958. The trial court found that the receipts from the rental of the shoes were properly included in the audit and were a part of the gross receipts of the bowling alley, subject to the tax levied by &sect; 786(3)(b). Although the gross receipts of the bowling alley, as defined by the audit, included the receipts from the rental of the shoes, the tax imposed by &sect; 786(3)(b) was upon the privilege of &quot;operating a place of amusement&quot; and not on the rental of personal property. The burden of the gross receipts tax did not fall upon the taxpayer, as that tax was required by law to be added to the total gross receipts and passed on to it customers. Thus, the burden of the sales tax fell upon the taxpayer when he bought the shoes and the gross receipts tax upon the taxpayer's customers when they rented the shoes. Although there was double taxation in the sense that two taxes have been paid on the same item, the two taxes did not fall upon the same person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the ballot provided in the election in 1958, the question submitted to the voters was whether the proposed tax should be levied for the tax year beginning on October 1, 1966, and become due and payable on that date. The court below found that the majority of the votes cast were in favor of the tax. Ala. Code &sect; 274(7) (1940) was enacted to validate certain elections held since June 4, 1951, for the purpose of authorizing a special school tax for school purposes. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the act was unconstitutional because it contained more than one subject. He also asserted that the legislature exercised a judicial function. The court held that the title of the act was a fair expression of the single general subject of the act. The provisions of the act were all germane to the title. The only condition precedent for the application of the validity effect of the act was that a majority of the votes cast in the election favored the special tax. The court ruled that no probable injury to the taxpayer's substantial rights could have resulted from the rulings even though some technical error may have accompanied some of the rulings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a Negro, was convicted of the first degree murder of a seven-year-old Negro girl. The same jury imposed the death penalty. The court affirmed the conviction. A petition for leave to file a writ of error coram nobis was then filed with the trial court on the ground that the conviction was illegal because of the use of a confession. The court denied that petition. Shortly before the date of execution, new counsel filed another petition for writ of error coram nobis and the trial court stayed the execution. Counsel failed to appear for the hearing and the court dismissed the writ. Subsequently, the new counsel filed a motion to vacate the order of dismissal, which was overruled. A notice of appeal was filed. Although the court found that the trial court did not commit reversible error in dismissing the writ of error, it addressed the grounds for the writ. The court held that Ala. Code tit. 14 &sect; 318 (1940), which provided that the death penalty could have been imposed on a defendant convicted of first degree murder at the discretion of the jury, was not unconstitutional on the ground of lack of standards by which the jury was to exercise its discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that &sect; 697(b) applied to leased vehicles which were used to haul the property of a lessee and imposed a license tax on the taxpayer's vehicle. The court ruled that the fact that the taxpayer received a notice that his vehicle would be taxed under Ala. Code &sect; 697(a) was not controlling. The language of Ala.

It was reasonable and permissible to classify the taxpayer's vehicle with other vehicles which used the public highways to make a profit for the vehicle owner by transporting the property of others.

The bill for declaratory judgment was then filed by the landowners. In affirming the dismissal of the bill, the court stated that, although the legislature of Alabama delegated legislative authority to municipalities to pass general zoning ordinances and to establish planning and zoning commissions, the power to zone involved legislative functions that could not be so delegated under constitutional principles of separation of governmental powers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimants sued defendant insurers because the plaintiffs objected to the disposition of a surplus accumulated by one of the defendants at the time of its conversion to a stock company under the provisions of 28 Ala. Code &sect; 242 (1940). The plaintiffs contended that the surplus should have been returned to the policyholders. The trial court found against plaintiffs and dismissed the bill. On appeal, the plaintiffs claimed the trial court erred in not decreeing that the surplus be returned to the policyholders, in cash or stock, because a decree in a previous case had held that such a distribution should be made. Plaintiffs argued that the holding was binding on the trial court. The court held that the principle of res judicata did not apply because the parties in both cases were not the same. The evidence established that the conversion was effectuated in accordance with the provisions of 28 Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 231-2448 (1940). The plaintiffs did not have a divisible and vested interest in the surplus. The plaintiffs' property interests, as policyholders, were not an ownership interest, but a fiduciary interest. The decree of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unlicensed pharmacists filed a class action against respondents, claiming that their sudden enforcement of rules regarding the licensing of pharmacists would have caused them irreparable injury. Pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect; 234, the unlicensed pharmacists were permitted to practice pharmacy if they were properly supervised. A temporary injunction was issued, which restrained respondents from enforcing the rules against the employers. Respondents' motions to discharge and dissolve the temporary injunction were denied. In affirming, the court determined that the motion to discharge was properly denied because there was no irregularity or error in the mode of granting or issuing the injunction. Moreover, the court refused to consider some of respondents' other assignments of error because they were uncertain and indefinite. The trial court was not bound to deny protection to the unlicensed pharmacists because they had a right to engage in their profession. In addition, the court determined that the unlicensed pharmacists did not have an adequate remedy at law because the original complaints were brought against their employers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute provided that an elector was not allowed to vote a straight ticket in certain elections held in a county with a population of 500,000 or more. The citizen attacked the statute on the ground that it was a local law and therefore violative of the Ala. Const. &sect; 104(29). Section 104(29) provided that the legislature should not pass laws providing for conduct of elections. The court held that the statute related to the conduct of elections. The next question was whether it was a general law or a local law. The court held that the statute was a local law because it attempted to make an arbitrary classification without proper relation to the subject matter. The court also held that the statute violated the uniformity requirement of Ala. Const. &sect; 190. Section 190 provided that elections laws within the state were to be uniform.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 26, &sect; 375 (1958). The employee sought review of the trial court's decision, rendered on respondents' application for rehearing, to reduce his money award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight months after the employee was hired as a moving picture machine operator, he was expelled from the union for refusal to comply with union rules.

Although the replacement had more &quot;seniority&quot; than the employee, the employee had been employed for a longer period. The court affirmed the judgment for the employee. The court held that the trial court did not err in finding that respondents violated &sect; 375(3), which provided that membership in a union could not be required as a condition of employment continuation. The court concluded that the contract between the employer and the union, as construed and applied with respect to the employee's right to continuation of employment, violated &sect; 375(3) because requiring longevity of union membership as a condition of continuation of employment was the same as requiring union membership as such condition. The court reversed the reduction of the employee's money award because the application for rehearing had been discontinued and the trial court did not retain jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants, the Board of Education of Montgomery County (board), board members, and school superintendent, appealed an order of the trial court (Alabama), which permanently enjoined respondents, members of the Alabama Public School and College Authority, members of the Alabama Building Commission (commission), director of the commission, and architects, from awarding a proposed contract to construct a school building in Montgomery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the proposed contract for construction of a school building, respondents required any contractor who worked on the construction of the building to pay all laborers, mechanics, carpenters, masons, and other specified classes of employees a predetermined minimum wage according to a rate schedule. The trial court permanently enjoined respondents from requiring the predetermined wages in the construction of the school and any other construction in Montgomery. It ordered respondents to distribute the construction funds allocated by the legislature for construction of the school to the board and ordered the issuance of new advertisement for construction bids without inclusion of the wage requirement. On appeal, the court affirmed, ruling that the contract provision requiring contractors to pay a predetermined, minimum, hourly wage violated the Alabama Competitive Bid Law. The court reasoned that there was no express grant of authority to the commission to require a bidder to agree to pay a predetermined, minimum wage to the bidder's employees and that the legislature had not delegated to the commission its discretion to specify that a contractor pay a minimum wage.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of the United States remanded the case. Defendant contended that there was a systematic exclusion of persons of color from the jury rolls. On appeal, the court determined that the grand jury pool and the petit jury pool all contained persons of color. The court concluded that defendant had not discharged his burden of showing a systematic exclusion of members of his race and that the evidence supported the findings made by the trial court. The court stated that based on the evidence, it seemed that every effort required was made to select impartially from both races those who were qualified for service and the trial court had ruled correctly on that issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed a decree from a lower court (Alabama), which sustained defendant neighbors demurrers and dismissed the landowner's request for an injunction to order her neighbors to remove a wall to permit the natural drainage of surface water. The lower court held that Montgomery, Ala., Code, art. I, ch. 13 &sect; 7, conflicted with state laws by giving one landowner rights in the land of another landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner sought to enjoin her neighbors from building a wall that restricted the natural flow of surface water from her property and caused her land to flood. She based her action on a local ordinance that prohibited the wall. Without the ordinance, the landowner had no right to complain. The lower court found the ordinance invalid and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court held that the lower court correctly held the ordinance invalid. State law permitted the neighbors to build the wall. The lower proprietor in an incorporated town or city could build a wall or on his property extending to the line between it and higher property and thereby prevent water from passing from the higher property over his property. Therefore, the local ordinance, Montgomery, Ala., Code, art. I, ch. 13 &sect; 7, impermissibly conflicted with the long declared policy of the state governing urban property rights with respect to surface waters. A municipal corporation was a creature of the state, existing under and by virtue of authority and power granted by the state. The court held the ordinance was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The city asserted that the trial court erred in issuing its injunction and lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company proposed to operate a quarry to mine and crush limestone on the land in question, and it submitted an application to the city for a permit granting that use because the land on which the quarry site was located was within the police jurisdiction and subject to the zoning ordinance of the city. After investigation, the permit was denied, but the company nevertheless commenced its operations. The city began arresting the company employees and otherwise attempted to halt the company's operations. The company sought a temporary injunction restraining the city from interfering with its quarrying business. The petition was denied, but the employees then filed a second suit seeking to prevent interference with their right to earn a living; the trial court granted the injunction. The city asserted that the trial court erred in issuing its injunction because the company failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, individually and as a citizen of the State of Alabama, sought a declaration that 1965 Ala. Act No. 662 was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the taxpayer relief. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In reaching its decision, the court first considered the taxpayer's challenge on the basis of Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 93, which prohibited the state from engaging in works of internal improvement. The court held that 1965 Ala. Act No. 662 did not authorize either the state or the State Industrial Authority to engage in works of internal improvement in violation of Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 93. The court explained that the act authorized the State Industrial Authority to make grants to local public bodies which could, in turn, choose to use the grants in whole or in part for a work of internal improvement. Next, the court considered the taxpayer's claim as to Ala. Const. art. 11, &sect; 213, which prohibited the state's creation of a new debt. The court held that the appropriation and pledge in the act for servicing bonds did not create a new debt under &sect; 213. Thus, the court found no constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

The demonstrators contended that Birmingham, Ala., General City Code &sect; 1158, which regulated street parades, was void because it violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court disagreed and affirmed, holding that the demonstrators were named in the injunction and were served with a copy. They were also active in inciting others to parade and actively participated in the parades or marches after they were served with a copy of the injunction. The court quashed the contempt against two other demonstrators because it did not find in the record that they were served with a copy of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certiorari review, defendant appealed a judgment of an appellate court (Alabama), which affirmed a trial court's judgment of conviction against defendant, who was found guilty of changing or concealing his name with the purpose of concealing his identity in violation of Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 229.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the offense of which he was convicted was the offense created by the third alternative of &sect; 229 and that the third alternative was void and unconstitutional because it was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The third alternative of the statute made a person who changed their name to conceal his or her identity guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine if convicted. In agreement with defendant, the court reversed the conviction because the statute was so vague and indefinite and because a person could lawfully change his name without resort to legal proceedings where it was not done for a fraudulent purpose and in the absence of statutory restriction. The court gave several examples of a lawful change of a person's name to conceal identity such as the name of an adopted child, the name of a foster parent, and the name of a divorced wife. Thus, the court declared the third alternative to the statute unconstitutional as it improperly made criminal name changes that were neither evil in nature nor detrimental to the public interest. The statute also denied the requirements of due process due to its vagueness.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the automatic appeal law, defendant sought review. On appeal, the court held that the invitation to enter defendant's room, extended by defendant to the person who knocked on his door, did not constitute a consent to the search of his room so as to constitute a waiver of defendant's right to complaint that the search and resulting seizure were committed in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V. The law enforcement officials did not identify themselves and did not ask to be allowed to search the premises. Further, the court stated that when a police officer arrested without a warrant, and the defendant objected to the introduction of evidence claimed to be incident to such an arrest, the burden was on the state to show that the arrest was lawful. The court held that appellee, the State of Alabama, did not meet that burden. However, the court held that photographs and evidence showing defendant's confessions were admitted without error.

The proposed statute, in providing an alliterative method to contract corporation limits, was not a suspension of law in violation of Ala. Const. &sect; 21.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local citizen swore out a criminal complaint against the local newspaper when it published an article that allegedly constituted &quot;electioneering&quot; or soliciting votes in support of a proposition that was being voted on the day that the election affecting such proposition was being held. The issue on appeal was whether the state legislature, in an effort to maintain orderly elections, reasonably used its police power in limiting full free speech and freedom of the press by denying to all persons the right to solicit votes, or electioneer, while the electorate recorded their wishes at the polling booths on election day. The court held that: (1) &sect; 285 was within the field that the legislature could properly and constitutionally exercise its police power; (2) the Corrupt Practices Act (Act) did not so clearly appear to be an unwarrantable interference with the guaranteed constitutional right that it was within the power of the court to declare it void; and (3) the Act's provisions were clear, unambiguous, and not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rejected that contention, and the court affirmed. The court held that the contractor was liable for a use tax, pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 788 (1940), because all purchases were made by contractor for use in Alabama, and title to them remained in the contractor until they were used and accepted by the government. The court further held that the contractors were not acting as agents of the government in bringing the building materials into Alabama, but that they brought them into Alabama for their own beneficial use in completing the contracted project.</SPAN></P>

The optometrist asserted that Ala.

The optometrist claimed that the requirement constituted unlawful discrimination against all licensed optometrists who were not members of the Association. He also argued that Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect; 206 was unconstitutional because it provided for an unlawful delegation of authority to the Association. The trial court held that Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant developer brought an action against respondents, a city and its commissioners (city respondents) and a county tax collector, for a declaration that city respondents unlawfully assessed ad valorem taxes. The developer sought to restrain the tax collector from collecting the taxes. City respondents appealed from the decrees of a trial court (Alabama) that sustained the developer's demurrers to their cross-bill and jury trial demand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer filed a motion to dismiss the appeal from the decree sustaining its demurrer to the petition to intervene of putative intervenor, the city's Board of Water and Sewer Commissioners. Section 3 of Act No. 18, 1956 Ala. Laws 279 provided that the city could not levy or collect taxes to annexed property being served by existing water and/or sewer lines until the city or Board reimbursed the owners for installation costs. The developer installed lines before the Act's enactment. The city annexed the property and did not reimburse the developer. After the developer conveyed the property to grantees, ad valorem taxes were assessed. The court held that the interests of the Board were the same as those of city respondents and dismissed the Board's appeal. The Board and the grantees were necessary parties, as a court was going to have to decide whether the Board could collect taxes from the grantees. The developer was not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief. It was not the owner at the time of its complaint or the Act's effective date. City respondents had the right to demand a jury trial, as the developer's action was known at common law as one to collect a debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a negro, sought review by writ of certiorari of a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Alabama), which affirmed without opinion his conviction for violating Birmingham, Ala., Gen. City Code &sect; 1436 (1944), as amended, proscribing any person from remaining upon the premises of another after having been warned not to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed without opinion petitioner's conviction for violating &sect; 1436. He argued that there was no evidence that he was forbidden to remain on the premises of a motel by the innkeeper, that &sect; 1436 was unconstitutionally vague, that he was actually sentenced to jail and fines for violating the city's segregation policy, and that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the petit jury on the ground that he made a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of negroes. The court denied the writ sought by petitioner. A warning directed to the entire group to leave was sufficient to meet the warning requirements of &sect; 1436. Section 1436 clearly specified that the conduct made a criminal offense was trespass after warning. It could not be said that there had been a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because the evidence did not support a finding that petitioner or any of his associates entered the restaurant, or sought to enter it, or sought to obtain a room in the motel. Evidence which merely showed that no more than two negroes had been observed sitting on a jury was not sufficient to make a prima facie showing of exclusion from the jury boxes because of race.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) there was no bar to the assessment and collection of a use tax on the items in controversy under either the federal or state constitutions; (2) the use tax was uniform, non-discriminatory, and was levied on all sales alike regardless of the use to which the property was put; (3) the tax liability attached after the act of transportation ended and the property came to rest in the state for use or consumption, unless there was a contractual intent to the contrary; and (4) personal property, purchased at retail outside of Alabama, even though used exclusively by a religious group in their religious services, was not exempt from the use tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Covington County (Alabama), which granted defendant's motion to quash based upon its finding that Act No. 149, Local Acts 1927, page 64 was unconstitutional. Defendant had been charged by affidavit with the offense of obtaining property by means of a bad check.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the motion to quash was properly granted because Local Act No. 149 violated the Ala. Const. &sect; 5. The court noted that, while it was true that the local act upon which the affidavit was issued was silent as to the constitutional requirement that such affidavits had to be based upon probable cause, it was the law of the State of Alabama that when a statute was silent on the subject of a constitutional mandate, the presumption was that the legislature intended for the constitutional requirement to be complied with. Reversing, the court held that the presumption was that the legislature intended for the affiant to make the affidavit in compliance with the Alabama Constitution, not in violation of it. The affidavit itself did confirm that there was probable cause for believing that defendant had committed the crime that he had been charged with. The court noted that the motion to quash would have been properly granted had the affidavit upon which the warrant was issued not been based upon probable cause. If that had been the case, the affidavit and warrant would have been a mere nullity and defendant's motion would have been properly granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's grant of defendant's motion to quash and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court judgment, holding that the son's wanton misconduct could be imputed to the father, just as the negligence of a driver could be imputed to a car's owner, where, as here, the owner had a right to exercise control over the car.

Code tit. 4, &sect;&sect; 63-76 (1958). The owners claimed the ordinance was unconstitutional because it limited the use of the owners' land to agricultural and residential uses and prohibited every use above 35 feet.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the owners brought an action, attacking the ordinance's constitutionality. Following an unfavorable judgment, the owners sought review. Although a literal application of the ordinance was potentially unreasonable to some of the zoned area but not to other parts of the area, the court held the city could not be required under the Act to: (1) spell out the dimensions of buildings constituting a hazard; (2) say at what point in the area various types of buildings could be erected; or (3) designate in what area the heights of buildings and trees should vary. Moreover, in the light of the Act's provisions, the court held the city had been empowered to adopt an ordinance containing a blanket or uniform restriction as to height and to limit the types of structures that could be erected in such area. Finally, in upholding the ordinance's validity, the court held that if the ordinance's general restrictions worked an injustice or imposed any unfair restraint on an individual property owner, such an owner had a statutory remedy for relief.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that in enacting the zoning ordinance, the county commission was engaged in a legislative function and was not engaged in contracting. The court held that the zoning ordinance of the county did not result in a contract between the county and the landowners, thereby creating a vested right that was free from the action of the city in rezoning the area. The court held that the forfeiture of the landowners' investment was of minor weight and importance in comparison with the city's duty to foresee the traffic and to protect pedestrians and motorists. The court held that the establishment of vested rights in the city to the naked lots was dependent on the reasonable necessity for protecting and promoting the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the public, and the landowners did not acquire a vested right to the lots in question so as to make them immune from the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board issued a general price fixing order covering five milk classifications, which was made applicable to the distributor, a Mississippi corporation, by another order, and claimed that the distributor had underpaid its producers during two paid periods for milk sold under government contract and to another distributor. The distributor claimed that the Board was without jurisdiction to enforce its price regulations because they would be an undue burden on interstate commerce. On review, the court found that the Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries could act as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Board and his participation did not render its orders invalid, that the Board's orders did not deny the distributor due process because a second meeting was a continuation of an earlier meeting, and that the effect of the Board's orders on interstate commerce was only incidental or indirect and therefore not unconstitutional because there was no overriding action by Congress on the subject.

The court held that: the stockholders had sufficiently pleaded their complaint; the statute was not too general to set standards for corporate behavior; the penalty prescribed in the statute was not unreasonable and arbitrary; and the stockholders were not required to plead actual damages as damages were presumed when the complaint charged a breach of duty.

The life insurance company further argued that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional and affirmed the judgment in favor of the bank. Section 74 did not prohibit the investment of trust funds in the bonds of a private corporation, but stated that the legislature could not authorize such an investment. The court concluded that the legislature, by enacting the Act, was not authorizing an investment, but was merely providing a more expedient means of attaining the same result as a trust instrument.

The court thought that reasonable construction gave effect to 1953 Ala. Acts 518, and 1955 Ala. Acts 434, and 452 and each of them, and that the legislature in enacting 1955 Ala. Acts 452 did not intend to repeal 1955 Ala. Acts 434. The three acts provided three alternative methods permitting the voters to decide what form of city government they desired. The permitting of one method was not inconsistent with permitting also another method or methods. The court further stated that 1955 Ala. Acts 452 did not repeal 1955 Ala. Acts 434, that they were not in conflict as to the form of ballot, and that the November 6, 1962, election was legal and valid. The issue as to when the terms of those to be elected mayor and councilman would begin was to be judicially determined in a proceeding in quo warranto between the real parties in interest who were not parties in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grocer sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Alabama), which denied the grocer's petition for a writ of mandamus against appellees, a county board of health, each member thereof in his official capacity, and a county health officer. The petition sought to compel appellees to issue the grocer a health permit, which had been refused because of the grocer's failure to comply with a local health regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A door connecting the grocer's living quarters and his store violated a health regulation adopted pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 22, &sect; 85 (1940). The grocer claimed that &sect; 85 was an unlawful delegation of legislative power and that the regulation was unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory, and unjust, and served no useful purpose in conserving, protecting, or promoting the public health in part because direct access to the living quarters was a matter of practical necessity to protect the safety of those who operated small grocery stores in dangerous neighborhoods. Affirming the denial of the writ, the court held that the implied limitation against the delegation of the lawmaking power did not prevent the legislature from authorizing its own appointed agency to make minor rules and regulations as were necessary or appropriate for the administration and enforcement of general laws. The court found that the grocer's right to conduct his business was subject to reasonable regulation and, based upon the testimony of medical and sanitary experts, was unable to say that the regulation was so unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory, or unjust as to render it invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 57, &sect; 77 et seq. (1940).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The watch company sought injunctive relief to prevent the jewelry company from selling watches. The trial court sustained the demurrer filed by the jewelry company and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the decree and held that the Fair Trade Regulations, especially the &quot;non-signer&quot; provision of Ala. Code tit. 57, &sect; 82, were unconstitutional because they violated Ala. Const. &sect;&sect; 1, 35. The court determined that the legislature could regulate competitive prices or prohibit bona fide price cutting only if the business regulated was affected with a public interest. The court concluded that the sale of jewelry, watches, and related items was not so affected with a public interest as to allow a curtailing of free competition and the right to contract by price setting among retailers by the manufacturer. The court further determined that for a business to have been affected with a public interest, the community at large had to have had some pecuniary or legal interest in the manner in which the business was conducted. The court noted that the businesses of barbering and operating a gasoline station were not affected with a public interest but the milk industry was.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper, based in New York, published an advertisement in an attempt to gather support for the civil rights movement in the late 1950's, which stated that students were mistreated by police at an African-American university in Montgomery following a peaceful protest. The Commissioner filed an action asserting libel arising from the advertisement. The newspaper contested personal jurisdiction and asserted that the Commissioner could not maintain an action because he was not personally named in the advertisement. The trial court found that it had personal jurisdiction because the newspaper had agents in the state to collect news, and that the paper solicited advertising and had a circulation in Alabama. The jury found for the Commissioner and awarded him damages. The court held the trial court had jurisdiction because the newspaper maintained sufficient contacts with the state to meet the minimal standards for personal jurisdiction, and that the newspaper waived its contest by filing a motion to dismiss on the merits. The court also held that the jury could have linked the police to the Commissioner and found that the article was directed at him as an individual.</SPAN></P>

The school board made concessions that her child would be allowed to wear clothing the parent considered modest and that she would be excused from performing objectionable exercises; the trial court adopted the concessions and denied the petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to going to work one day, defendant found several handbills scattered in the street. He picked them up and took them with him to a restaurant and handed them to several other people to read. The handouts called for a boycott of the transit system. He was arrested and charged with a violation of Ala. Code tit, 14, &sect; 56 (1940). He claimed that &sect; 56 was unconstitutional and void as violative of U.S. Const. amend. 14 and Ala. Const. 1901 art. 1, &sect; 4. The court found that the constitutional questions raised by defendant were without merit. Further, the information filed in the case was in the language of the statute and was sufficient. The motion to strike the information and the demurrer interposed to it were overruled without error. However, the court felt impelled to reverse and remand on the ground that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence and for the refusal of the trial court to grant a new trial based on that ground. The court concluded that the judgment was wrong and unjust.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the legislative intent in enacting the statute was not for the judicial branch to determine.

A judgment of involuntary nonsuit was entered almost six months before the father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One count alleged that the company had an unused or abandoned well or cistern off of a road and on its premises for a long time, which was not covered, filled, or substantially enclosed. It alleged that the father's son was either killed by falling into it or died after falling in, being unable to extricate himself from it. It was further alleged that the presence of the cistern violated Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 384 (1940), which required the company to guard against injuries to persons or livestock caused by such cisterns, and that such an allegation was sufficient to show negligence per se. The second count alleged that the company allowed a dangerous instrumentality to remain in a position where children, known to frequent the premises, might be hurt. On review, the court found that the complaint did not state facts showing a duty because &quot;off of a road&quot; was not an allegation that the cistern adjoined a public highway, which was required to show that the company had a legal duty to the minor. The court noted that to hold a landowner to a duty to protect children who were not invitees from water hazards on its property would create an intolerable burden on the ownership of property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 3a of the Act provided that it was unlawful for a seller, with intent to injure competitors, destroy or substantially lessen competition, to sell cigarettes at less than the seller's cost. The court held that the provision did not deprive the seller of equal protection or due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, because the states were free in the exercise of their police power to regulate prices charged by an industry if the legislature determined that the public interest required such regulation. However, the court held that under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 35, Ala. Const.&nbsp;art. I, &sect; 36, and Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 103, in a business not affected with the public interest, the legislature could not regulate competitive pricing policies by declared standards of fair competition. However the legislature could exercise its police power to inhibit creation of monopolies, whether the business of concern was affected with a public interest or not.

Petitioners then filed an application for a writ of prohibition on the ground that &sect; 6 was unconstitutional because it violated Ala.

The enactment of the zoning ordinance was strictly a legislative function, and by allowing a de novo review, &sect; 6 granted the circuit court legislative power beyond the proper function of the court. The only review, which the circuit court could properly undertake, was to determine whether the board acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unlawfully in enacting the ordinance.

The court affirmed, finding that jurisdiction under the Act was not limited to equity courts because the legislature provided for equitable relief under Ala.

The heirs filed a writ of mandamus seeking to review the order. Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 827(2) (1955), upon payment of a transcript fee, the party desiring the appeal was entitled to have the court report promptly transcribe the evidence. The court held that nothing in &sect;&sect; 827(1) to 827(6) prevented any party from appealing upon the record without a transcript of the evidence. However, until payment was made, the court reporter was not required to transcribe such evidence record. The court determined that, under Ala. Const. &sect; 10, no person was to be barred from prosecuting or defending before any tribunal in the state. Nonetheless, the court found that review by appeal was entirely a creature of the legislature and further found that no party had a vested right to an appeal order other than what the legislature may care to confer. The court held that the legislature was allowed to limit and restrict the right to appeal without violating the Fourteenth Amendment. The court denied the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

The board granted the variance for use of the land as a parking lot. The neighbors appealed. The circuit court affirmed the board's decision. The neighbors again appealed. The court reversed and held that (1) the applicant, as a conditional purchaser, was entitled to apply for a variance as the agent and with the consent of the holder of the legal title; (2) evidence was sufficient to support a finding that unnecessary hardship would result from literal enforcement of the ordinance and that the variance granted observed the spirit of the ordinance; and (3) Ala.

The judge's order was made 14 days after the judgment was rendered in the Court of General Sessions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the abolition of the terms of circuit courts in 1936, the time within which a circuit court could exercise its discretionary power to set aside a default judgment had been limited to a period of 30 days from the date such judgment was rendered. The judge argued that he had the same discretionary power to set aside a default judgment. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. Act 40, 1956 Ala. Acts p. 328, which created the Court of General Sessions, provided that the practice and procedure of the court, in the exercise of the civil jurisdiction conferred by the act, should conform to and be governed by the laws applicable to the practice and procedure in the courts of justices of the peace. While the Court of General Sessions was designated as a court of record, this did not show a legislative intent to give the court a power over its judgments after their rendition different from that possessed by justices of the peace. In the absence of a statute providing otherwise, a justice of the peace had no control over a judgment after the day of its rendition. Thus, the Court of General Sessions was without power to set aside the default judgment in favor of the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court upheld the state's license tax assessment against the contractor. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the license tax was validly levied against the contractor as a consequence of its performance of a contract with the United States for maintenance dredging of a channel in an Alabama bay. The court held that &sect; 496 required a license on the performance of a contract and not just on its acceptance. The court held that the local activity of performing the contract in Alabama was realistically separate from the interstate process or flow of commerce and the tax incidence was the performance of the contract in Alabama. Because the performance of the contract admittedly was wholly within Alabama territory, without any possibility of any other state imposing a tax on such performance, the court found no unconstitutional burden or discrimination in the application of the license, which applied to resident and nonresident contractors. The court held that the license tax was not an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The court held that the mere possession of a federal license did not immunize the contractor from the state tax.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the owner argued that there was no proof that the town was a municipal corporation, that the ordinance was not posted or published as required by Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ala. Code tit. 51, &sect; 481 (1940) imposed a tax on the use or consumption of carbonic acid gas in manufacturing, compounding, producing, or bottling certain drinks, including soft drinks, in bottles or other closed containers. The bottling company, which used carbon dioxide gas in its manufacture of a soft drink, argued that the class that was designated in the statute was arbitrary and capricious and not based on any real distinction or difference from other persons using carbonic acid gas. The trial court held that the tax was unconstitutional in that it constituted a substantial burden that was not imposed when the beverages were not produced or bottled in closed containers. The court reversed the trial court. It held that the power to tax was essentially an attribute of sovereignty and was vested in the legislative department. Legislative classifications in tax matters were presumably valid and the burden was on the challenger to prove that such classifications did not rest on a reasonable basis. A license tax on certain manufacturer was a valid exercise of the legislative power. The statute, effectively, made a reasonable distinction between wholesalers and retailers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a log manufacturer, was assessed a deficiency in it's severance tax payment. The taxpayer claimed that the State improperly construed the tax in assessing the deficiency, but the trial court upheld the deficiency. On appeal, the taxpayer also challenged the constitutionality of 1945 Ala. Acts 169, as amended by 1953 Ala. Acts 695, but the court overruled the challenge. The court held that the trial court correctly interpreted the tax in upholding the assessment. The court further held that the State properly determined that the taxpayer was liable for the tax based on its log tally as opposed to the log scale standard of measurement. The court also rejected the taxpayer's equal protection claim holding that the tax did not unconstitutionally discriminate against those who manufactured logs within the state. The court also held that the State's imposition of a higher tax rate on resident log manufacturers was based on the privilege that they enjoyed by manufacturing the logs in the state. Finally, the court held that the classification employed in the statute had a rational basis and did not deny the taxpayer the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

The Ordinance, promulgated by appellee city, sought to regulate the practices of optometrists and the optometrist had sought construction of the Ordinance and prayed that it be declared invalid in its entirety or in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city promulgated Ordinance No. 1112, which was intended to regulate optometrists. The optometrist challenged the Ordinance and the circuit court ultimately held that the Ordinance was within the city's police power, was not inconsistent with the laws of Alabama, was not unreasonable, and was entirely valid. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that &sect; 3 of the Ordinance, which required applicants to present &quot;satisfactory evidence&quot; to the city clerk that he was qualified to serve as an optometrist, and &sect; 4 of the Ordinance, which provided for a board to assess such evidence, were void for their vesting of arbitrary discretion in a municipal official. Sections 3E, 3F, 3G, 3I of the Ordinance, which dealt with advertising by optometrists, were in conflict with the legislative policy of Alabama as set forth in Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect;&sect; 210, 211 (1940) and were therefore void. Sections 3B, 3D of the Ordinance, which concerned office location, were patently in conflict with Ala. Code tit. 46, &sect;&sect; 210 (1940) and were therefore void. The remaining portions of the Ordinance were valid, pursuant to the saving clause in &sect; 8 of the Ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee entered into a workmen's compensation settlement agreement with his employer. The trial court approved the settlement. The employee died from unrelated causes and left a wife and two children. He had not received the total amount of his benefits at the time of his death. The employer claimed that the wife and her children were not entitled to the part of the compensation award that had not accrued at the time of the employee's death. The trial court ruled in favor of the wife, and the employer appealed. The court reversed the judgment and held that 1955 Ala. Acts 279(F) created new substantive rights in favor of the wife and her children by adding to the employer's obligation a requirement that it pay money that it was previously not obligated to pay. The court held that the amendment, which was construed so as to give the wife the right to the unaccrued installments, contravened the provisions of the state and federal constitutions forbidding legislation impairing the obligations of contracts. The court agreed with the premise that a workmen's compensation act was contractual in nature and that any legislation changing terms of the contract was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the applicant's contention that &sect; 88 made approval by the board of revenue and road commissioners merely a ministerial function after an application had been approved by the board of health. Section 88 provided that when a report was received from the board of health concerning its investigation from a sanitary standpoint, a governing body would either grant or deny the application, giving due weight in reaching either conclusion to the views expressed by the board of health.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lawsuit was concerned with the constitutional validity and enforcement of the &quot;Solomon Bill,&quot; 1953 Ala. Acts 974, which effectively took away from a state employee, merit system privileges and benefits if such employee became a member of a labor union. Prior litigation involved the predecessors of the association and the Board. The court affirmed and held that the bill lacked equity by failing to show a justiciable controversy. Without specifying the facts amounting to a controversy, the court could not proceed to declare a justiciable controversy upon a bare allegation of apprehension, anticipation, or fear of unauthorized, illegal, or unconstitutional acts by public officers to be committed in future. Viewing the bill overall, it apparently attempted to seek relief based upon facts that occurred between the association's predecessor and the former members and administrator of the Board, under a presumption that the incumbents would act in a similar manner. The acts of the Board's predecessors would not be imputed to the Board in such a way that without any further affirmative act or threat by the incumbents, a controversy still existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant fell from a scaffold and was injured. He filed suit to recover workmen's compensation benefits. In addition, the claimant, who was between 16 and 17 years of age at the time of the accident, alleged that he was entitled to double benefits under tit. 26, &sect; 258 because the employer failed to file an employment certificate with respect to the claimant, as required by &sect; 352 of the Child Labor Law, Ala. Code tit. 26, &sect; 352. The trial court awarded benefits to the claimant, but denied his request for double benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the claimant was not entitled to double benefits for the employer's violation of the Child Labor Law because the employment was not per se unlawful, the violation was purely procedural, and there was no relationship between the violation and the claimant's injury. The court also concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding compensation that exceeded the claimant's average weekly earnings. The court noted that under Ala. Code tit. 26, &sect; 279(G), the trial court had discretion to base the award on the claimant's average weekly earnings or to award a higher amount, as justice required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant merchants sought review of the judgment from the trial court (Alabama) that sustained appellee city's demurrer to the merchants' bill seeking a declaration of rights and challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance adopted by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The merchants filed a class action challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance adopted by the city. The merchants sought a declaratory judgment, praying for a declaration of the constitutionality, legality, and effect of that ordinance; a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the ordinance; and that the relief prayed for be granted to all merchants similarly situated. The trial court sustained the city's demurrers. In affirming, the court held that the ordinance did not deny equal protection because the entire attempt of the ordinance was to tax the gross proceeds of the city's sales transactions on an equal basis. The court further rejected the contention of the merchants that the taxing ordinance was not validly enacted.</SPAN></P>
