</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were twin brothers, sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), which convicted them both of aggravated rape, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42, and sentenced them to life imprisonment and death by electrocution, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants committed the rapes consecutively on one victim. They were both convicted and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the refusal of the trial judge to grant a continuance or a recess was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable because counsel for defendants did not falter in presenting defendants' testimony and they were alert and competent in their questioning. The court ruled that the granting or refusing of a continuance in a criminal case rested in the sound discretion of the trial judge. The court found that the death sentence was not violative of the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment because the jury saw defendants, observed their demeanor, and heard their testimony on direct and cross-examination. The court further held that defendants failed to present any law that required the death sentence to be vacated. The court concluded that defendants were properly denied a new trial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 851 because counsel for defendants did not show that the averred newly discovered evidence if it had been presented at trial would probably have changed the verdict of the jury.</SPAN></P>

Defendant got in his car and started to drive away. The police officer ordered him to stop and followed him. Defendant pulled into a driveway. When he got out of the car, the officer continued to write up the ticket. Defendant called the officer an offensive name and the officer arrested him. Defendant then ran into the house and when the officer followed him inside, physically resisted arrest. On appeal of his conviction for resisting arrest, the court set aside the conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the bill of information and the bill of particulars informed the trial court and defendant of the charges against him and would support a plea of former jeopardy. Defendant was not prejudiced by the fact that the State announced that it was prosecuting defendant under all paragraphs of &sect; 14:08 but adduced no evidence to support some ways in which the statute might have been violated. The trial judge abused his discretion by excluding a 12-year old girl from testifying as a defense witness where she stated that she knew it was a crime to tell a lie.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review by certiorari a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit (Louisiana), which affirmed a judgment decreeing that his six minor children were neglected children within the purview of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:1561-1580 and in need of protection of the State. The father presented several arguments against the judgment on review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's sons were removed from his home shortly after an incident occurred with one of the sons where the father fired a gun in the air. The father claimed that he simply fired the gun in order to cause his son to come back home to see what made the noise. The son initially alleged that the father fired the gun at him, but he later conceded that the father fired the gun into the air. The father's daughters were also removed from his home after one of his daughters ran away from home. The district court thereafter rendered judgment declaring the father's children to be neglected under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:1561-1580 and awarded their care to the department of welfare. The court reversed the judgment. Specifically, the court held that the children should be returned to the custody of the father because the entire case against the father consisted of hearsay and no medical evidence was introduced tending to establish the father's mental instability, as seemingly suggested by the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment placing the custody of the father's minor children with the State and the judgment affirming it. The court ordered that the minor children be returned to the custody of the father immediately upon rendition of judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentence to 10 years and 211 days imprisonment for aggravated criminal damage to property. The court affirmed. Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 401, the trial judge did not err by excusing two prospective jurors who were unable to read and write the English language to the trial court's satisfaction. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 401 was constitutional and did not deny defendant equal protection and due process. The requirement that a person be able to read and write the English language to be qualified for jury service was reasonable and nondiscriminatory. The statute operated equally against all persons tried by jury and afforded no advantage to the State, which was not afforded to the accused. Literacy was more apt to assure an understanding of the evidence and the law and would bring about a fair trial for both the accused and the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff voters appealed a judgment entered in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which dismissed their action to have certain tax statutes of defendant city declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters sought to have declared unconstitutional certain statutes, which authorize the imposition of local sales and use taxes by the governing authorities of the Cities of Baton Rouge and Baker and the Parish of East Baton Rouge, without prior approval of the voters of those political subdivisions. Also attacked as invalid were the ordinances passed by the respective governing bodies, which levy sales and use taxes pursuant to the statutes. The voters showed that general legislation on sales and use taxes required voter approval, but that the legislature has allowed exceptions for governing bodies of defendant subdivisions. The voters charged that the exception was illegal because it operated unfairly and discriminated against them as residents. The subdivision asserted that the voters' appeal was not timely under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;13:4452. On review, the court held that the subdivisions' contention was sound and that the time limit of that statute applied, even though the suit did not specifically involve the validity of bonds addressed in the statute. The sales tax was to be used to pay off the bond obligation and the court held that this fact made the provision govern.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed a judgment of the District Court (Louisiana), after a jury trial, which convicted defendants of the sale of marijuana to a person over the age of 21 years, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:962(A) of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:961 et seq. Both defendants were sentenced under 1970 La. Acts 457, La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981, in effect when the crime was committed, there were two different sentencing ranges for defendants over and under the age of 21. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:971(b)(2), enacted later, had no age distinction or minimum sentence and allowed for a fine. Defendants asserted that the bill of information was defective for not alleging their age, that a fine under &sect; 40:971(b)(2) was unconstitutional, and that the prosecutor's reference to a lack of rebuttal while pointing at defendants was grounds for mistrial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the age of defendants, while a factor in sentencing, was not an element of the offense. The court noted that under 1970 La. Acts. 457 the effective law on the date of the crime governed, but the district court was allowed discretion to impose a lower sentence under &sect; 40:971(b)(2). The court found that &sect; 40:971(b)(2) benefitted defendants, and no fine was imposed; thus, they lacked standing to contest its constitutionality. The court ruled that the remark was not a reference to defendants' failure to testify, thus, a mistrial was not required under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants filed a motion to quash the bill of information where defendants where charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute. The district court sustained the motion, and the State appealed. The court held that crimes requiring specific intent had long been part of the criminal law and had been codified in Louisiana Criminal Code. Analogous statutes had many times been upheld by the court. Defendants argued that the law, insofar as it dealt with marijuana, was unconstitutional because the body of the act was broader than its title. Defendants argued that simple possession of marijuana was now a misdemeanor, whereas it was formerly a felony, and a new crime, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, had been created, but that neither of these substantive changes was mentioned in the title of the act. The court rejected that argument, holding that the title of an act was not to be strictly or technically construed. All that was required was that the title of a statute should be indicative of its object. La. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 had to be construed broadly with the view of effectuating, not frustrating, the legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court also granted certiorari to review the district court's contempt judgment, which sentenced the legislator to 10 days in jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A joint legislative committee was established to investigate organized crime in Louisiana as it related to government officials. The legislator testified before the committee about an alleged attempt to unlawfully influence his vote. Subsequently, the legislator made public statements that he possessed relevant evidence, including tape recordings, not presented to the committee. The committee issued a subpoena ordering him to bring the tapes, and when the legislator did not appear, the committee instituted contempt proceedings. The court held that the appellate court correctly concluded that it had no jurisdiction because contempt of the legislature was akin to criminal, not civil, contempt, and so not appealable in the absence of a statutory or constitutional provision for review. The court then affirmed the district court's judgment, holding, inter alia, that venue for the contempt proceedings had been properly laid and that the appropriate procedures were followed; and rejecting, inter alia, the legislator's claims that a member of the legislature could not be punished by a joint committee and that the constitutional principle of separation of powers had been violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish ordinance, which prohibited the manufacture, sale, or consumption of beverages of an alcoholic content greater than one-half of one percent by volume, regulated more broadly than state law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:588, which provided that beverages containing more than one-half of one percent alcohol by volume and not more than 3.2 percent alcohol by weight could not be prohibited. Defendant claimed that to allow the parish to enforce the ordinance resulted in a denial of equal protection and due process of law as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The court first held that the ordinance was still in effect. The court then noted that the only criterion for whether a local parish imposed restrictions more stringent than those imposed by the state was when the parish had called a local option referendum. Classifications based upon this criterion alone could not withstand equal protection scrutiny. Therefore, the court held that insofar as the ordinance prohibited the business of producing, manufacturing, rectifying, using, distributing, storing, or consuming of beverages of an alcoholic content of less than 3.2 per cent by weight, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers brought the class action against defendants, the department of agriculture and an advertising and development commission, challenging the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:451. The buyers prayed that the statute be declared illegal, unconstitutional, and violative of La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8 (1921). The statute levied a tax on sweet potatoes. The buyers appealed from a judgment that dismissed their demands and held that the statute was not unconstitutional because of legislative and jurisprudential exclusion of certain groups from the sweet potato tax imposed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the classification was not arbitrary, invidious, unreasonable, or oppressive. The court further reasoned that there was neither discrimination nor classification among the shippers involved and there was a reasonable basis for the classification between shippers and growers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence that followed from the second trial. The court rejected all his claims of error.

Defendant's claim that the jury venire was improperly drawn was not supported because no group had been intentionally excluded. Defendant's motion was properly denied for a transcript of the first trial because the motion was filed too late, and the refusal to provide the requested transcript did not result from the financial inability of defendant to pay for it. The trial court did not err in refusing to transcribe testimony from the first trial from witnesses who were not present at the second trial where there was no evidence that defendant attempted to locate them. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial based on prejudicial comments by a prosecution witness where the comments were responsive to the questions propounded by defense counsel, and defense counsel made no request for a jury instruction to disregard the testimony.</SPAN></P>

The firemen sued to enjoin their employer, the city and its officers, from applying to them a state statute requiring their retirement at age 65. La. Rev. Stat.

The district court held that the statute was unconstitutional insofar as affecting firemen in municipalities of 13,000 to 250,000 in population. The lower court held that such firemen enjoyed tenure until death and, until then, were removable only for cause. On appeal, the court held that the constitutional enactment providing civil service protection for firemen of the municipalities in question was not intended to and did not within its scope encompass the regulation of retirement, mandatory or otherwise.

The court reasoned that the division's act was analogous to a taking as to which the property owner deserved proper notice and a hearing. The court also held that none of the division's correspondence with the property unequivocally informed the property owner of an intent to have the cited defects repaired at the property owner's expense. The court further noted that &sect; 30-12(2) provided for notice and a hearing before assessing the liability for the repairs to realty and that the division did not follow that procedure in such a manner as to satisfy the due process requirements of reasonable notice and of an adequate hearing.</SPAN></P>

It was the jury's duty to decide whether the gun offered in evidence was the one pointed at the storeowner. The trial court properly overruled defendants' objection that certain evidence offered during trial was tainted by the fact that witnesses who could not identify defendants at trial were shown photographs of the accused prior to the lineup and prior to their testimony because the photographs were shown for the purpose of refreshing their memories and not for the creation in their minds of a mental impression of men never before seen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision from the trial court (Louisiana) which quashed a bill of information on the ground that the statute charging the crime was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision holding that a statute was unconstitutional, the court annulled and set aside the decision. Defendant was charged under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:971(c), Act 457 of 1970, as amended by Act 59 of 1971, in that he knowingly and intentionally possessed a controlled dangerous substance, to-wit: LSD. The State argued that Act 457 of 1970 as amended by Act 59 of 1971 was now constitutional for charging the possession of a controlled dangerous substance, LSD, since the title of the act as amended was sufficiently broad to include within the object of the act the intention to regulate all dangerous drugs and substances of a pharmacological nature, including LSD. The court held that all legislative acts were presumed constitutional. Further, the 1971 act sufficiently indicated its purpose in its title so as to amend the title of the former act, amend and reenact the sections specifically mentioned in the new title, and retain in effect all other sections of the former act not amended and reenacted. Since the new title was broad enough to include the sections which dealt with dangerous drugs and substances other than narcotics, those sections were now constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bill of information charged defendant with violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40-971(a), as amended by 1970 La. Acts 457, by possessing a controlled dangerous substance, a hallucinogen (LSD), with the intent to distribute. A trial court sustained defendant's motion to quash the information on the ground that the amendatory statute was unconstitutional, and the State appealed. The court ruled that the trial court correctly ruled that 1970 La. Acts 457 was unconstitutional insofar as affecting the present prosecution for possession of LSD. It was only the regulation of amphetamines, barbiturates, and hallucinogens that exceeded the title of sub-part A, as re-enacted by 1970 La. Acts 457. Thus, the court said, the amendatory law was unconstitutional insofar as it attempted to regulate these latter substances. While quashing the information was proper, the court added, the motion to quash could be cured by amendment or by a new information or indictment charging defendant under the correct statute. Thus, the State was entitled to file a new or amended bill of information within the delay allowed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to one year in prison. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress the drugs seized at his premises because the evidence was allegedly seized under an illegally issued search warrant. Defendant argued that the search warrant was illegally issued because the application for the search warrant was executed by only one affiant even though La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:972 required two affiants in an application for a search warrant to search any dwelling for narcotics. The search warrant was issued upon the affidavit of a police officer showing an adequate factual basis for probable cause. It complied with the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 162. On appeal, the court further found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:972 regulated only the issuance of warrants for searches and seizures to be made through a peace officer by the president of the state board of health. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The victim testified that defendant supplied him with glue often, and that it figured in his relationship with her.

The court noted that the State had the duty to inform defendant of the intention to use inculpatory statements in advance of trial, but the tape recordings were not inculpatory.

Following several continuances, he again appeared with his counsel and withdrew his former plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty.

The bill of information was not read at the time of arraignment because such reading was waived by defense counsel. But the trial court questioned defendant in detail as to the voluntariness of his plea, called to his attention the fact that he was waiving his right to trial, and informed him of the maximum penalty for the offense. Under the circumstances, the court found no abuse of discretion. His counsel stated unequivocally that he knew that the charge was simple kidnapping, and that the guilty plea was entered only after a full discussion of the matter with defendant.

Defendant was sentenced within the statutory range. Defendant argued that &sect; 14:110.2 violated his constitutional rights by providing a more severe penalty for penitentiary escapees. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:110 (amended 1970) provided lesser punishments for all other escapees. The court agreed that penitentiary prisoners were not similarly situated to other prisoners, particularly those prisoners sentenced for misdemeanors. Prison escape was detrimental to the escapee, the prison, and the adjacent community. The legislature's separate classification for penitentiary prisoners was not arbitrary and there was a rational basis for the differing punishments. The range was not so excessive as to shock the conscience. The disparate sentencing structure did not violate defendant's equal protection and due process rights or the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment or La.

In addition, the court noted that the state could abandon the graver offense and proceed on the lesser offense if it desired.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A metal fragment lodged in the claimant's eye during the course of his duties for his employer. The fragment was removed the same day and the claimant returned to work after three weeks. He received compensation for that period and medical expenses. More than two years later, the claimant's retina detached and he lost all of the vision in that eye. The causal connection between the accident and the retina detachment was undisputed. The trial court dismissed his suit for permanent and total disability as barred by &sect; 23:1209 because the claimant's disability arose more than two years after the causative accident. The court of appeal affirmed. On review by writ of certiorari, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 23:1209 was constitutional. The state was not constitutionally required to provide a cause of action in its workmen's compensation statute for long-delayed disabilities and losses arising more than two years after an accident. The failure of the Louisiana Workmen's Compensation Act to afford full recovery for all losses recoverable in tort did not impair its validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the district court of the possession of an opium derivative and received a 12-year prison sentence. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. The court noted that defendant failed to make a motion to suppress the two hypodermic needles and other material found on him when he was arrested. The court concluded his objection at trial when the items were offered into evidence came too late to raise the issue of an unconstitutional search and seizure. The court noted that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 703(A) provided that defendant aggrieved by an unconstitutional search or seizure might move to suppress the items. And that the motion must be filed no later than three judicial days before the trial on the merits began, unless the opportunity therefor did not exist or defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion. The court held the question of the unconstitutionality of a search and seizure and the admissibility of evidence seized thereunder was a legal question, which should have been heard by the judge. Because defendant failed to file a suppression motion, he could not attack the evidence's admissibility by objections at the trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he asserted three bills of exceptions; the failure of the trial judge to sustain his motion to quash the indictment, that &sect; 14:87 was unconstitutional, and the ruling of the trial judge allowing a doctor to testify that he heard a &quot;fetal heartbeat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with performing an illegal abortion. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence. The court held that if an offense could be committed by doing one or more of several acts, the crime may be charged conjunctively in a single count of an indictment and proof of any one of the acts set forth would support a conviction. And conjunctive charges of acts and intent were not a violation of the constitutional guarantee that defendant be informed of the nature of the charge. The court noted that defendant cited no authority for his controversial position that &sect; 14:87 restricting the right of a woman to obtain an abortion was unconstitutional and in fact there was none. The testimony of the doctor that the victim's pregnancy had reached the state of fetus was irrelevant, but harmless to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Enabling legislation touched upon the creation of hospital service districts. A relationship developed between a public trust designated and a hospital authority which involved a funding scheme.

The citizens filed a class action suit to have a trust declared invalid. The citizens also asserted that the trust was prohibited from issuing revenue bonds without an action by a majority of the taxpayers of the district. The trial court ruled in favor of the trust and the citizens sought review. On review, the court noted that the bonds were to be secured by the self-generated revenue of a lease proposed between a hospital service district as lessor, and the trust as lessee. The court found that the trust was valid and that it could issue revenue bonds without an election by a majority of the taxpayers of the district. The court found that the action taken was an acceptable alternative to a plan that required a referendum to approve the issuance of tax-supported bonds. The decision was left undisturbed.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were accused and convicted of aggravated rape. All of defendants except for one were sentenced to death; other defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendants appealed and asserted numerous arguments.

The court also rejected the contention that the effect of the joint trial denied them the assistance of counsel in violation of both the state and federal constitutions. Also, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a severance. All other errors asserted as to the case merits were rejected. As to the sentencing, the court ruled that the sentence of death could not be carried out as the jury did not impose or recommend it and the judge's decision to do so was unconstitutional. The death sentences were modified to life sentences.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had granted the injunction prayed for and had declared that the amendments to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:821-15:839 and 15:901-15:907 and a special act were unconstitutional. The court had issued a judgment reversing the trial court's judgment and declaring that the acts were constitutional. The court then withdrew its judgement and granted a rehearing. After the rehearing, the court reinstated the former decree as the final judgment of the court. The court held that it was proper for the legislature to authorize a director to purchase property for the proper use of its department and in the same act also authorize the sale or transfer to any other state agency state property under the jurisdiction of the department. The court held that it was not the purpose of La. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The maritime worker, while working on an offshore platform, had drowned when he attempted to rescue a boat belonging to the employer.

The appellate court found that the trial court's awards were excessive and remanded the case for a new trial. The court reversed and re-instated the trial court's decision. The court noted that state appellate review of jury awards under maritime and the Jones Act was, as in the federal court, extremely limited. The awards must stand unless the appellate court determined that there was no law and no evidence to sustain them. The court concluded that the appellate court, in concluding that the jury awards to the minor and two adult sons were grossly excessive, erred in restricting the basis of that recovery to the actual pecuniary benefits that they might have received had the seaman lived his allotted time. The death also came under the purview of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. They were entitled to damages for grief, anguish, and loss of love, companionship, and guidance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Classified employees of the fire department had instituted the suit challenging their forced retirement under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:691. The district court sitting en banc as a three-judge court, found that &sect; 42:691 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Defendants had contended that civil service review boards had jurisdiction in cases involving employee terminations. The court noted that the civil service review boards could not challenge the constitutionality of a statute and that the district court was the proper and only body, which could grant the employees' demands. The court stated that it had studied &sect; 42:691 in the light of the constitutional mandates and found that it was in conflict with La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 15.1(30)(a). The court noted that both the constitutional provision and the statute were clear and free from ambiguity. The retirement contemplated herein was a definite removal or separation from the classified service for a cause not set forth in &sect; 15.1(30). And age, not physical disability, was the prevailing factor for retirement. Such a factor was contrary to tenure during good behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgement from the district court that had held that the forced retirement of classified fire department employees violated the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted their motion to quash the charges and held that the 1970 amendment to &sect; 40:971 was unconstitutional insofar as it purported to apply to the control and use of barbiturate, amphetamine, and hallucinogenic drugs because its title was not sufficiently indicative of its object as required by La. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 . The provisions in the amendment that related to the listed drugs exceeded the limitations of the title to the enactment. The court confirmed the trial court's holding that the act was unconstitutional insofar as it attempted to regulate amphetamines and barbiturates. The court held that the trial court's judgment ordering defendants discharged was in error and that the prosecution should have been given a reasonable time within which to amend the bill of particulars or to file a new information.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1634. The district court had concluded the suit, which sought review of a board of review decision, was an appeal and that the district court lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was adversely affected by a decision of the board that he was disqualified for unemployment benefits. He brought suit in the district court for review of the adverse ruling. The district court on its own motion concluded that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the action. The court concluded that the suit was an appeal and that the district court lacked appellate jurisdiction. The court reversed and remanded the suit for further proceedings. The court held that La. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 provided that the courts must be open to every person for adequate remedy by due process of law. Although administrative bodies had the power to determine as original propositions the matters assigned to them under statute, a party whose legal rights had been adversely affected by that determination could have tested its legal correctness in the courts. The court also noted that judicial review of administrative determinations should not have been confused with judicial appeals. A district court's review of an administrative determination was not an appeal; it was in fact an original judicial action.</SPAN></P>

Shortly, thereafter a movement awakened her on her bed. She turned to face a man who grabbed her arm and held a metal object she believed to be a knife to her throat. He threatened her and warned her against any outcry, all the while holding the object to her throat and holding her left arm while her right arm was pinned beneath her. The assailant then raped her. The assailant then left by the front door. The victim stated to the police that as the result of an exposed flame in her bedroom she saw the rapist clearly. Several days later a man broke into a residence near the victim's home and tried to assault a small child. The man however dropped his wallet containing his driver's license with his picture, identification card, and papers. The items belonged to defendant. Another incident like the second incident had occurred previously in the same area. Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal the court affirmed.

The court held that the testimony was admissible under La. Rev. Stat.

On review, defendants raised 19 alleged errors by the trial court. The court examined each of the alleged errors and found no basis. For example, the court rejected the argument that the police did not have sufficient probable cause to make the warrantless arrest of defendants. Here, police had received detailed information from an informant that fit the specifics of a crime they were investigating. The court concluded that this, and other information, provided the police with probable cause to make the arrests without a warrant. The court also rejected the argument that defendants' confessions should have been suppressed because defendants were not advised of their right to use the telephone. The court found that neither Miranda nor La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 230 required specific notice of the right to make a phone call.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff registered voters sought a declaratory judgment that 1970 La. Acts 155, legislation that parishes divided by the Mississippi River with a population of more than 200,000 were to have three tax assessors, was unconstitutional. The legislation would create one assessor for one side of the river and two assessors for the other side of the river, for a total of three assessors. The parish in which the voters resided had one assessor prior to this legislation. The trial court held for the voters. Defendant parish committee appealed. The court affirmed noting La. Const. art.

Acts. 353, &sect; 902(4); 1970 La. Acts 452; and 1968 La. Acts. 192, &sect; 834 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1968 Acts at issue merged the Louisiana Board of Institutions and the Department of Institutions and consolidated the functions in the Department of Corrections; and authorized the Department of Institutions to create and establish a juvenile correctional institute. The 1970 Acts repealed the statutory provisions dealing with the defunct Department of Institution's operation of juvenile facilities, but authorized the Department of Corrections to establish and maintain a juvenile correctional facility in the greater New Orleans area; and authorized the Department to purchase the specific site at issue. The court reversed the trial court's findings of unconstitutionality. The court noted that all the parts of the acts in question, those repealing statutory provisions and those adding provisions, had to be construed with a reference to each other; and that doing so removed the constitutional arguments that the bills had been structured and named improperly. Finally, the court held that there was no constitutional problem in the state legislature's choice of the specific site because the legislature was not subordinated to parish authorities with respect to zoning.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the legislature was required to designate each loan's purpose and amount with sufficient particularity to properly identify the use to which the funds were to be put and that an &quot;appropriation&quot; contemplated that the sums authorized to be paid out by the legislature would have been derived from funds that were in the State's treasury when the appropriation was made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant held up a general store with a pistol and left. Shortly thereafter, defendant was arrest and brought to the store, where a store employee identified him as the robber. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and appealed his conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant a preliminary hearing, because the matter was within the discretion of the trial court, which discretion was not abused. The court also determined that defendant's request for a bill of particulars was sufficiently answered by the state, and defendant was not entitled to additional information, because discovery was not permitted under the criminal rules of procedure. In addition, the court observed that the trial court correctly limited defense counsel's question of potential jurors, because it was not the counsel's duty to question jurors about their opinions concerning evidence to be offered at trial. Finally, the court concluded that the identification of defendant shortly after the incident was legal, because it occurred shortly after the arrest, and the witness did not hesitate in identifying the defendant. The court upheld defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipality charged defendant with refusing a chemical breath test for intoxication in violation of a city code applicable to automobile drivers. Defendant filed a motion to quash the affidavit alleging that the ordinance on which the charge was based was unconstitutional. Defendant and the municipality's attorney filed a joint stipulation of facts. The trial judge declared the ordinance unconstitutional and sustained the motion to quash. The municipality had not reserved any bills of exception at the time of the ruling and the trial judge filed no per curiam to either of the bills of exceptions. The municipality appealed. Defendant contended that there was no reviewable question because no bill of exceptions had been reserved as to the ruling on the motion to quash. The court noted that it was not able to consider evidence in a criminal case unless it was incorporated in a bill of exceptions. The court also held that the posture of the case was such that the constitutionality of the ordinance was not ripe for review. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling solely because of the absence of a reviewable bill of exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The murder investigation led officers to arrest defendant at his home. Defendant made certain inculpatory statements after he was given his Miranda warnings. Subsequently, defendant gave two recorded statements that established his joint participation in the crime with an accomplice. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the statements and to suppress the comparison of defendant's fingerprints with a print found on the victim's personal check. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting defendant's contention that the evidence was obtained as a result of an illegal arrest without a warrant and without probable cause. The court held that the warrantless arrest was proper under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 213(3) because the officers had reasonable cause to believe defendant committed an offense. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the manner in which the venire was selected systematically excluded various classes of the population. Finally, the court held that the trial court's ruling in the jury's presence on the denial of defendant's motion for a directed verdict was not a prohibited comment upon the evidence.</SPAN></P>

In reversing, the court rejected defendants' argument that the corporation, not the individuals, damaged the property. The court stated that the letter included with the bill of particulars indicating that the lessee was a corporation was irrelevant. The court further rejected defendants' argument that no criminal liability attached under &sect; 14:56 when a landlord-tenant relation existed. The court stated that there was no immunity from criminal prosecution merely because the complainant had the option of pursuing a civil remedy as a landlord.</SPAN></P>

In partitioning the community property, the trial court awarded the wife one half of the amount of the settlement, excluding the husband's recovery for medical expenses, and subject to payment of her share of the community debts. The husband contended that the award to the wife violated the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment, but the appellate court rejected his claims. However, the appellate court remanded the matter because the settlement had not been itemized. The court agreed with the appellate court that the constitutional claims were without merit and that the settlement should have been itemized because the wife was not entitled to participate in that portion of the settlement funds that compensated the husband for damages accruing after the dissolution of the marriage. However, six years had passed since the husband's injury, and because of the passage of time, the court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the appellate court's judgment and remanded the action to the district court with instructions to dismiss the action if the applicant filed an amended petition that challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court concluded that although it was enacted after the application was filed, the ordinance applied to the applicant because the permit was not issued before its passage. The court also held that the arguments that the applicant could not have challenged the ordinance's constitutionality lacked merit, noting that he had a right to have his constitutional rights protected and that deciding the constitutional issue in the mandamus proceeding promoted judicial economy.

The 1851 governmental survey of the township showed certain &quot;factional half-sections&quot; and &quot;fractional quarters&quot; on the shores of a lake. These included &quot;fractional share 21&quot;, consisting of 45 acres of swamp land. Except through a clerical error the &quot;fl. sec. 21&quot; applied for was shown on the 1881 patent as &quot;fl.

The court held the description on the 1881 patent was erroneous and ambiguous, if not void, because it described a non-existent area with regard to section 21.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the developers were entitled to less than market value. The trial judge concluded that the evidence failed to show that the developers knew the exact location of the extension of the highway and found that the developers had not acted in &quot;bad faith.&quot; The court of appeal reversed. The court held that the trial court's assessment was correct. There was no evidence that the developers had actual knowledge that the highway would be extended through their subdivision. The acquisition of these lots by exercising their rights under their development contract was a natural and normal extension of a plan of development planned and plotted years before. The lots were adjacent to land already owned by the developers and some of them lay on partially improved streets. The construction of houses was timely and met an actual demand that existed in the market. The developers advertised the houses aggressively before they were notified by the highway department of the impending expropriation. Consequently, the measure of compensation for the taking of the houses was their market value at the time of taking, and not the &quot;salvage value.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the trial court properly applied La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 110.2 in affixing the penalty, because a subsequent statute did not supercede the penalty provision of this statute. The court ruled that defendant was not placed in double jeopardy as result of the action taken by the prison's disciplinary board, in placing defendant in isolation for 10 days and forfeiting one-year's good time from his record. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in admitting testimony of witnesses that established the defendant's location when he was apprehended after his escape.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the state attorney general and other officials, sought review of a judgment from the lower court (Louisiana), which decreed that 1970 La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that 1970 La. Acts 33 was unconstitutional in several respects. The Act, which had the effect of raising the pay for state troopers, was found to be unconstitutional by the lower court. On review, the court affirmed. It found that the troopers were subject to the civil service laws and that Act 33 was in conflict with the civil service laws because it ascribed to the legislature a power which was taken away from it by the electorate's adoption of a constitutional amendment which the legislature had passed by joint resolution. According to the court, it was not possible for the legislature to pass Act 33 as an amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1394, which at its inception had no relation to civil service, because in 1970 1952 La. Acts. 299 had been superseded by the Civil Service Amendment set forth in La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 15. The court noted its support for the troopers, but stated that it was incumbent on them to make their demands for higher wages to the proper members of the Civil Service Commission rather than to members of the state legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that declared legislation that raised the pay of state troopers to be unconstitutional, null, void, and of no effect, and granted permanent injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The tax was demanded and collected on behalf of a waterway district pursuant to La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 30.5 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:2301 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waterway district comprised seven parishes. All of the railroads owned property in one of the parishes and one of them owned property in each of the other six. They claimed that district taxpayers were subject to unfair discrimination in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because three other parishes fronted on the river served by the waterway district and benefited from it while paying no taxes. Intervenor waterway commission joined the action to resist the railways' claims. The court agreed with the railways that the exclusion of the three parishes violated the Equal Protection Clause because the record reflected no reasonable basis for excluding them. It held that a map presented to the court did not provide a reasonable basis for the parishes' omission because the map did not reflect the topographical and economic differences which the sheriff and the commission argued justified the exclusion. The court refused to conclude, without other explanatory evidence, that the proximity of cities to the river was pertinent to the classification's reasonableness. It held that the allegations of the petition set forth a cause of action with respect to the asserted illegality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1421, the legislature purported to set uniform salaries based upon parish population for sheriffs throughout the state, with the sole exception of Orleans Parish. Although the title of a 1969 reenactment of &sect; 33:1421 stated that the compensation of sheriffs was to be based upon applicable parish population, except only for Orleans Parish, the amendment included a proviso fixing the salary of the sheriff of Iberia Parish at less than the amount stipulated for sheriffs of parishes in the same population classification. The sheriff of Iberia Parish sued for declaratory judgment that the proviso violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, but was severable from the remainder of the statute. The court affirmed a judgment for the sheriff. The proviso conflicted with the title of the statute, failed to carry out the purpose of the statute, and was in direct opposition to the purpose of the statute. Accordingly, it established an unreasonable, arbitrary classification that denied the sheriff equal protection of the laws. The proviso was severable from the remainder of the statute, which continued in full force and effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant encountered her husband with the victim and, in the ensuing fight, stabbed her to death.

VI, that the trial court erred in permitting an unsequestered witness to testify, and that the district attorney improperly commented on defendant's failure to call her husband to testify. In affirming, the court ruled that the state requirement of an affirmative vote of only nine jurors to convict was not unconstitutional. The court also ruled that, although the witness called to testify should have been excluded during the previous testimony, she testified to only a single fact to which no other witness testified and that, therefore, the error was not prejudicial. The court noted that, unlike former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:371, La. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a property taxpayer and registered voter in a parish road district, sought review by a direct appeal, pursuant to La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10(1), from the judgment of the District Court (Louisiana), which upheld the validity of a special bond and tax election and dismissed his suit against defendant parish police jury. He sought, inter alia, to have the election declared null and void, and contested the constitutionality of the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All registered voters in the road district, not just the property taxpayers, were permitted to vote in a special election in a parish road district. The election concerned the issuance of bonds for the construction and maintenance of roads in the district and the levying of a tax on property in the district for the same purpose. The election was called pursuant to La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10, art. XIV, &sect; 14, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:520. The court reversed the district court, which had upheld the election, and declared such election null and void, as the constitutional requirement, restricting voting to property taxpayers in the road district, was constitutional and was violated. The court held that the provision of La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 14, which limited voting in the election to a &quot;property taxpayer qualified to vote&quot; under the constitution and laws of the state, was in no way repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, as the election concerned purely local roads, not federal, or state, highways or parish thoroughfares. Further, such restriction was reasonable, as the local property owners, rather than the taxpayers of the parish generally, paid for the local roads.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court. The court rendered judgment in favor of the property taxpayer and against the police jury, declaring the special bond and tax election in the road district null and void, and enjoining the police jury from selling the bonds and enforcing the tax purportedly approved at said election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment from the district court (Louisiana), which dismissed his suit to enjoin defendants, a city and parish, from collecting sales and use taxes levied under Baton Rouge, La., Ordinance 2473 (March 25, 1970) and East Baton Rouge Parish, La., Ordinance 3400 (July 22, 1970) and from funding bonds with the tax proceeds pursuant to East Baton Rouge Parish, La., Res. 8968 (1970), Baton Rouge, La., Res. 8968 (1970).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In dismissing the suit, the district court held that the city and parish plan of government did not conflict with the city's authority under 1898 La. Acts 169, &sect; 23 (amended by 1946 La. Acts 334) to impose taxes. Taxing authority granted to the city and parish was not an abandonment of the state's taxing power in violation of La. Const. of 1921, art. X, &sect; 1. The city ordinance set a one and one-fourth percent sales tax. Two-thirds of the tax was to be spent for capital improvements. The balance was for general city purposes. The city was exempt from the general repealing clause of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2712 (1950), which limited a municipality's taxing power to a one percent sales tax. The general statute did not affect the city's special power granted by its charter to collect taxes imposed pursuant to its police power. 1970 La. Acts 559 authorized the parish to levy the two percent tax imposed by its ordinance. The sales and use taxes were valid, but the bond resolutions were invalid. Under La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 14(a), bond resolutions could only be passed with the approval of taxpayers in a bond election. Taxpayers had to consent to the incurring of the debt to be funded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment allowing bonds to be funded by the use and sales tax proceeds was reversed and set aside and the resolutions were declared null and void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water and sewerage board sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Louisiana) that dismissed the board's petition for confirmation of a drainage plan. The plan was based on the Drainage Act Amendment, La. Const. art. XIV, &sect;&sect; 23.13 to 23.27, which the trial court declared unconstitutional. Appellees were landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court ruled that the Drainage Act Amendment did not deny equal protection. Pre-amendment, millage taxes were imposed on the entire city to drain land. However, with the amendment, the board was empowered to require the landowners to pay for their own drainage via special assessment for the cost of drainage although previously drained land in the same area- -area A per the Drainage Act Amendment- -had been paid for by millage taxes. Differences and distinctions in treatment violated the equal-protection guarantee only when the variations were arbitrary and without a rational basis that was reasonably related to a valid governmental purpose. According to the court, the legislative determination was that the largely undrained sections of the city in area A should bear the cost of their own drainage unlike the already drained sections in area B, and this was within legislative discretion. Significant to the court was that there was no showing of an intent to assess the lands in area A alone with drainage costs while contemporaneously draining similarly classified lands through general tax revenues without any reasonable basis for the distinction in treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ruling in favor of the board and against the landowners, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that the taxpayers could not maintain the suit because they had failed to filed a sworn list of property as required by La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a witness for the State at defendants' trial for aggravated arson denied having a conversation with one of defendants, the trial court allowed the State to impeach the witness by introducing a prior statement in which the witness had said that one defendant admitted participating in the arson. Defendants failed to ask the trial court for a limiting instruction to the jury that the statement was admitted solely to impeach the witness and not as evidence of defendants' guilt. After holding that the State was entitled to use the statement to impeach the witness under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:487, because the witness was hostile, the court reversed the convictions and remanded because the trial judge failed to give a cautionary instruction. However, the court held that in the future it would require a criminal defendant to specifically request a limiting instruction in order to preserve the failure to give the instruction as an issue for appeal. To this extent the court specifically overruled State v. Barbar, 250 La. 509 (1967). The fact that evidence of the arson was introduced in a prior trial for a different arson to show system and intent did not result in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that 1970 La. Acts 216 was constitutional and the representatives appealed. The appellate court found that 1970 La.

No provision was made in &sect; 33 for interim appointment of judges; thus, the exclusion of interim appointments was intended. Section 33 provided that a special election should be called for the election of new judges. The portions of 1970 La. Acts. 216 that were in conflict with La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues before the court demanded an interpretation of La. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 23 and 26.

The appealing parties argued that, because the full complement of the court did not hear their cases and because less than a majority of the complement of the court ruled in favor of the appellees, the judgments violated La. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 23 and 26. Specifically the judgments were rendered by three members of a five- judge court sitting en banc. The court agreed and reversed the judgment, finding that the court of appeal could sit en banc with less than its full complement of judges, but that such judgments had to be rendered by a majority vote. The court explained that the court of appeal consisted of six judges and that, therefore, a majority decision and judgment had to be concurred in by four members of the court of appeal or its complement when it was sitting en banc.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were charged with murder, and they filed motions to quash a grand jury's indictment, arguing that the procedure used to select the grand jury and petit juries in the parish where they would be tried violated their rights under the Louisiana and United States Constitutions. Evidence showed that the trial court issued an order that instructed the clerk of the court and the jury commission to select a grand jury and petit jury by placing cards with the names of people who were customers of an electric company and people who were registered to vote into a box, by periodically drawing names from the box, by sending questionnaires to people whose names were drawn to determine if they were qualified to serve on a jury, and by randomly selecting the names of people who were qualified to serve to form grand juries and petit juries. That system was used from 1964 until 1969, when a new system that employed voter registration lists was put into place. The state supreme court held that defendants failed to show that the methods used from 1964 until 1969 to select grand juries and petit juries were arbitrary and worked irreparable injury to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged in separate bills of information with trawling in inside waters of the State of Louisiana during the closed season, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:495.1. The trial court (Louisiana) granted defendants' motion to quash the bills of information, finding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:495, as amended by 1962 La. Acts 452, which defined inside and outside waters, was unconstitutionally vague. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that defendants trawled in Caillou Bay, Parish of Terrebonne, Louisiana. Defendants claimed that the statutory description of the inside waters was inadequate to place them on guard as to the location of the inside waters either by the recitals of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:495, as amended by 1962 La. Acts 452, or on a sketch that was annexed to the statute. The appellate court found that the recitals of the statute describing inside and outside waters conflicted with the line drawn on the sketch in the Caillou Bay area. Therefore, persons trawling in Caillou Bay during the closed season had no way of knowing when they were in the inside waters. The appellate court rejected the State's argument that the sketch controlled, and that, when the recitals and the sketch were read together, the location of the inside waters was clear despite the conflict. The conflict could not be resolved by giving preference to one provision over the other, absent a statement in the statute to that effect. Even if the sketch prevailed, the sketch did not describe the inside waters with the degree of certainty required of a penal statute. Thus, the trial court's ruling was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After removal, the relators moved to remand in federal court. This motion was denied. The relators contended that the state court erred in deferring to the federal removal, arguing that the federal court was without jurisdiction and that its judgment was a nullity, because the procedures under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1441 were not followed. The United States argued that it removed the case under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1651(a). The court held that: (1) the prior federal ruling that the suit was properly removed had become definitive, as it was not appealed; (2) the federal court was competent to decide whether or not it had jurisdiction of the case sought to be removed, and its determination, even if erroneous, was not a nullity; and (3) res judicata under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2286 applied, as the requisite identities of the parties was present, as the relators, the United States, and the defendant school board were also parties to the decision and determination in federal court of the motion to remand filed there by the relators, and because the cause of action and the object of the demand were the same, where both sought a decision that the removal was improper.</SPAN></P>

Acts 223 of 1970 was the enabling act, and Act 314 of 1970 was the appropriating act to spend tax funds for secular educational services from teachers employed by nonpublic schools. The trial court issued a rule nisi. The supreme court declared the acts unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court issued this opinion to reduce to writing its reasons for its prior decree declaring both acts unconstitutional and permanently restraining the treasurer and educational superintendent from acting under, or expending funds through, the acts. Its decision was based exclusively on the application of Louisiana, not federal, constitutional provisions. The supreme court was of the opinion that the acts violated three provisions of the Louisiana Constitution of 1921: (1) the prohibition against the enactment of any law &quot;respecting an establishment of religion;&quot; (2) the prohibition against the expenditure of any money from public sources, directly or indirectly, &quot;in aid&quot; of any religious group or &quot;in aid&quot; of anyone engaged in the capacity of minister or teacher of such group; and (3) the prohibition against appropriating funds to &quot;any private or sectarian school.&quot; The supreme court found the purpose of the acts was to use public money to fund sectarian schools by relieving them of their primary financial burden of paying teacher salaries. This would assure the continued advancement of the faiths the schools represented in violation of the establishment clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court explained that they previously held that both acts were unconstitutional, as they violated the establishment clause and two other provisions of the state constitution prohibiting appropriation of any public funds to aid religious or non-public schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The abortion was performed with a tube known as a French catheter. Defendant did not support her argument with precedent from other states that such abortion charges were generally being considered unconstitutional by courts in other states, that such statutes were similar to Louisiana's, or that Louisiana should follow precedent in those other states. The supreme court had to follow the legislature's pronouncements in the statute versus public opinion. The trial court properly allowed the introduction of a note, allegedly handwritten by defendant giving the victim instructions, and two sheets of paper from defendant's office that were the same size as the note to show the source of the note and to compare handwriting, but properly did not allow defendant to look into the victim's purse to find exculpatory evidence, as there was no foundation that the purse was the same purse the victim put the note into such that the note might pick up (or not pick up) lipstick or other residue to show that the note did not come from defendant.

The cross-examination of the deputy sheriff as to the search of another house was improper, as the marijuana was taken from defendant's person.

Defendant's motion to quash his indictment was not an appropriate vehicle for alleging an unconstitutional search and seizure. Defendant was searched incident to a lawful arrest.

The Supreme Court assumed, for argument purposes, that those defects existed, but nevertheless ruled that the assumed defects did not make the removal ineffective. The Supreme Court stated that the federal district court was competent to determine its own jurisdiction and that the federal district court's determination remained in effect until it was reversed on appeal by a proper federal tribunal. The Supreme Court further noted the principal of comity, that, here, a state court was to refrain from upholding its jurisdiction over that of a federal court when the subject matter was already the subject of decrees of that federal court; that principal of comity was necessary to avoid continuous and chaotic conflicts between state and federal courts, which would in turn place litigants and state courts in an obviously untenable and impossible position--acting in defiance of federal court orders.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff electric power company sued to acquire a servitude 100 feet wide across the properties of defendant landowners. The suits were consolidated. The trial court granted servitudes for transmission lines across the properties and fixed the amounts due for the expropriation. The landowners appealed to the Louisiana Court of Appeal that affirmed the granting of the servitudes, but increased the amounts awarded. Both sides sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court's original opinion denied the power company's right to expropriate on the theory that the public need had not been shown. Feeling that it erred, the supreme court granted a rehearing. Contending that the expropriation statutes did not give them sufficient notice or time to prepare a defense and take discovery, the landowners said that, as applied, the statutes offended the constitutional guarantee of due process. The supreme court found that the fact that continuances were granted did not support a finding that due process requirements were offended and the statute was unconstitutionally applied. The second defense was that the statutes established a condition to expropriation that was not complied with. The supreme court disagreed finding that the appraisals and opinions of their expert land appraisers removed the power company's case from the bad faith contemplated as a bar to the right to expropriate. The power company's offer to acquire the property, when rejected, was sufficient to permit it to invoke expropriation. The supreme court found no abuse in the taking in light of the clearly demonstrated public need for better service by home and industrial users.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of having committed the crime of abortion in violation of the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:87(2). The trial court sentenced defendant to serve four years at hard labor in a state prison. On appeal, the court found that the issue of the trial court's refusal to order a preliminary hearing became moot after the verdict of conviction was rendered because defendant failed to show that the denial of any of the rights sought to be safeguarded by a preliminary hearing caused some specific prejudice which resulted in an unfair trial. The court found that the trial court overruled defendant's motion for a bill of particulars containing interrogatories or requests for information because they were either irrelevant or evidentiary in nature. The court also found that the trial court properly permitted a state witness to establish prior acts of abortion by defendant because such evidence was admissible to show intent. Finally, the court found that statements made by the accused to the arresting officer concerning similar acts was not inadmissible hearsay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was dismissed from her permanent position as a nurse's aide at a hospital. The Louisiana State Civil Service Commission upheld the dismissal, and the nurse challenged the decision of the Commission in the appellate court, and asserted that the Commission erred in upholding the constitutionality and legality of La. Civ. Serv. R. 12.10. The appellate court held that rule 12.10 was unconstitutional. Defendant, the state department of hospitals, filed a record of appeal as well as an application for writs of certiorari, which the court granted. The court considered the matter as upon certiorari, and disregarded the attempted appeal. The court reversed and held that Rule 12.10 complied with La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 15(N)(1) and that a rule providing for the permissible termination of an employee who was unable to perform his duties by reason of illness, and who had exhausted his sick leave, expressed a legal cause for dismissal. The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion that the discharge of the absent employee under the facts of the case was a proper exercise of the discretionary removal power by the appointing authority under La. Civ. Serv. R. 12.10.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the appeal as moot. The court stated that nothing it could do in the present proceeding would affect the parolee's custody or the rights of the litigants in respect to it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' petition set forth their chain of title and claimed that the property in dispute was land in the form of water bottoms. Defendants, without filing an answer, moved for summary judgment, contending that the property was actually the bed of navigable waters, and further that the property was sold to the State for unpaid taxes and that an attempted redemption by plaintiffs' ancestor in title was null. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, holding that defendants' documentary evidence established that the land was the beds and bottoms of navigable waters, and ruling that the property in question was thus owned by the State and was inalienable pursuant to the Oyster Statutes, 1910 La. Acts 189 and its predecessors and the statutes that replaced it. On appeal, the court annulled the summary judgment. It held that there were genuine disputed issues of fact as to the status of the property as land or water bottoms, as to the sufficiency of the patents in the plaintiffs' alleged chain of title, and as to the validity of the alleged tax redemption.

The court held that on further examination of the case, it was without the authority to consider whether defendant's requested charge was covered by the general charge where defense counsel did not make the general charge, by attachment or otherwise, a part of the bill of exceptions. As such, the court held that it was required to accept the trial court's ruling that the instruction was not necessary on the basis that the substance was contained in the general charge because under La.

Attempted murder and murder were separate offenses, were not different grades of the same offense, and one offense was not included in the other. Defendant argued that his change of venue motion was erroneously denied because the victim was an officer and the attendant publicity prejudiced his right to a fair trial. Defendant did not meet his burden under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 622 of proving that a change of venue was warranted. Only one witness stated he could not deliver a fair verdict because of pre-trial publicity, which had subsided in the 11 months since the officer was attacked. Defendant did not make out a prima facie case of discrimination to prove that the grand jury was illegally constituted where the venire was selected from the parish list of registered voters.

The prosecutor's reference was not a prohibited &quot;remark or comment&quot; made within the hearing of the jury impermissibly referring to an inadmissible crime committed by defendant under La.

Police searched defendant's home and car pursuant to a search warrant, seizing narcotics and burglar tools. On appeal, the court held that the affidavit underlying the warrant recited adequate probable cause because the informant's tip was corroborated by police investigation. Because guilty knowledge was an essential element of the crime of possession of narcotic drugs, the trial court properly permitted the prosecution to display to the jury the large amount of narcotics and paraphernalia seized as well as a surveillance film showing quantities of drugs inside defendant's home. Hospital records revealing that defendant was transported the day after his arrest for treatment of drug withdrawal symptoms were prima facie proof of defendant's guilty knowledge and admissible under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3714. Section 13:3714 did not violate defendant's right to confront witnesses or the physician-patient privilege and was an exception to the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1968 La. Acts 434. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3:455, purported to levy a tax on all Louisiana sweet potatoes inspected for shipment to market and to processing plants out of state. Louisiana sweet potato growers instituted proceedings to declare the Act unconstitutional in that it contravened La. Const. art. X, &sect; 8, which prohibited imposition of a license tax on persons engaged in agricultural pursuits. The trial court found that the tax was, in effect, a disguised occupational license tax on an agricultural pursuit and held for the sweet potato growers. The court affirmed. The tax was imposed as an exercise of the state's police power and was not a tax on the property itself. Insofar as the proceeds of the tax were used to advertise sweet potatoes and to promote the growth of that industry, it was not a revenue tax. By including a farmer or grower as a shipper, and requiring them to pay a tax every time they loaded their trucks for transport to market, a necessary element of an agricultural pursuit, the statute subjected farmers and growers to payment of a license tax in violation of the constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firefighters brought a declaratory judgment action against the parish to have a statutory pension plan recognized as valid and enforceable after the parish refused to implement the plan.

The firefighters appealed, contending that the plan was constitutional and that the parish was estopped from asserting a plea of unconstitutionality because several councilmen and other parish officials attended the meeting that developed the plan. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the acts that created the plan contravened the existing pension system insofar as it applied to the firefighters, and therefore, had changed the structure and organization of the parish government. The court held that the establishment and operation of a pension system formed an integral part of the structure and organization of local government and was an internal matter under the exclusive control of the parish.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge then overruled the State's motions to vacate the sentences. On application of the State under the court's supervisory jurisdiction, the court annulled and set aside the sentences and remanded for the imposition of legal sentences and the forfeiture of the trawls consistent with La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants each confessed to having raped the teenage victim and named each other as participants. The State was not required to produce any evidence other than defendants' written confessions. There was no authority for suppressing evidence before the grand jury. Officers had reasonable cause to arrest defendants without warrants under La. Crim. Code art. 60 (1928) based on information supplied by the victim and other investigative leads. Defendants were Mirandized before being questioned. Defendant four asked for an attorney before confessing but was not provided one; thus, defendant four did not intelligently waive his Fifth Amendment rights and his confession was inadmissible. Admitting the confessions was, at most, harmless error because each defendant admitted his own guilt. Any hearsay that implicated a co-defendant was corroborated by each confession. The State substantially complied with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 768 by advising defendants before trial that the confessions would be used against them. Defendants' requested jury charge on admissibility of the confessions was properly denied because this determination was within the exclusive province of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The state agency resisted the demand, pleading an exception of no cause of action and answering that the taxing ordinance was unconstitutional insofar as it purported to impose a tax on a state agency. The court affirmed a trial court judgment for the state agency. The language of La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 22, which granted the City the right to adopt a home rule charter, expressly provided that nothing in the section gave the City any power or authority over any state boards, commissions, or funds. The language of the limitation was of the broadest scope, and the fact that it did not expressly deprive the City of authority to tax state agencies did not justify and interpretation that authority to impose such a tax was not withheld.

The conviction of co-defendant was set aside and he was granted a new trial. Two patrolmen received a radio dispatch to proceed to a grocery store. They found the glass portion of the front door had been broken. Shortly thereafter, defendants were arrested. Defendant proceeded to voluntarily make a statement to the officers. Defendant told the officers that he and co-defendant burglarized the store. Co-defendant made no inculpatory statement. The court held that in the Bruton decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an accused's right of cross-examination secured by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment was violated at his joint trial with a codefendant who did not testify by the admission of the codefendant's confession inculpating the accused. This ruling was retroactively applicable in both federal and state prosecutions. The court held that this mandate required that the conviction of co-defendant be set aside. The unreliability of such evidence was intolerably compounded when the alleged accomplice did not testify..</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant presented four exceptions challenging the selection of the jury, the manner in which the tales jurors were selected, the denial his motion for a mistrial and the denial of his motion for a new trial. Defendant contended that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 831(3) was violated, because having been charged with a felony, he should have been present at the calling, examination, challenging, empanelling, and swearing of the jury and at any subsequent proceeding for the discharge of the jury or of a juror. The court concluded that it was not an abuse of discretion nor reversible error in overruling defense counsel's objection to the proceedings when a juror was excused. The court further noted that defense counsel was not deprived of his voir dire rights which he was entitled to assert and did assert after the commencement of trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a stadium building commission and various state officials, sought review of a judgment from the lower court that enjoined a lease and management contract that was executed for purposes of constructing and operating a stadium. The judgment from the lower court (Louisiana) held that the contract violated the Louisiana Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented by this suit was whether the transactions executed to effectuate the planning, financing, construction, and operation of a domed stadium project were contrary to the constitutional amendment adopted in 1966 authorizing the project, La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 47. After a lease was executed, this suit was filed by a taxpayer seeking an injunction to prevent the carrying out of the provisions of the lease and the management and operating agreement, from issuing and selling any of the bonds in accordance with the bond resolution, and from expending any sums in the execution of the lease. The trial court declared the lease, the management and operating agreement, and the bond resolution to be illegal and unconstitutional and, accordingly, granted an injunction. On review, the court reversed because it rejected the contention that the lease constituted the incurring of a debt by the State without the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the legislature as required by La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. According to the court, the lease in question was not executed upon legislative authority, but, to the contrary, was explicitly authorized by La. Const. art. 14 &sect; 47(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment below that found a lease to be unconstitutional, and recalled the injunction issued pursuant thereto.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the trial court (Louisiana) judgment that refused to recall the suspended sentences imposed on defendants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were sentenced to five years at hard labor and the sentences were suspended. The trial court refused to recall the sentences and the State sought review. Defendants were sentenced under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981, which provided in subsections (1), (2), and (3) that sentences imposed were to be without benefit of parole or suspension. Subsections (4) and (5) of &sect; 40:981 provided sentences of less severity for all other offenses, including manufacturing, possessing, and controlling of narcotic drugs, and allowed parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for those violations for a first offender. Contrary to defendants' contention, the court held that &sect; 40:981(5) was not a general provision modifying &sect; 40:981 in its entirety; therefore, all first offenders were not given the benefit of parole, probation, and suspension of sentence. Defendants argued that &sect; 40:981(3), which deprived an offender of the benefit of suspension of sentence, probation, and parole, imposed excessive, cruel, and unusual punishment and was thus unconstitutional. The court held there was no merit in that argument. Because the trial court imposed illegal sentences, the case had to be remanded.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. XIV, &sect; 30.2(B) on the grounds that the provision was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved a provision in the Louisiana Constitution that established a commission for a particular district and permitted the members to be selected by the Governor from nominees sent up by various different groups. The trial court declared La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 30.2(B) unconstitutional because it deprived plaintiff residents of the right to participate in the selection of the commissioners and therefore denied them equal protection of the laws. The trial court reasoned that the residents had absolutely no choice in the selection of the board members who had the right to tax them, which was taxation without representation. On review, the court reversed because it found that the body established by the amendment was an administrative body and that its commissioners possessed in the greatest part administrative powers. It found that the selection process evidenced a sense of fairness to the representative groups. Also, the amendment was voted on by the electorate. Under such circumstance, the court found no denial of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

In response to defendant's bills of exceptions, the court first found that the trial court properly overruled a motion to quash filed by defendant because, contrary to defendant's contention, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:961 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981 were not unconstitutional. The court found that the trial court properly overruled defense counsel's motion for a unanimous jury verdict because La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 41 (1921) required that only nine of the 12 jurors concur with a verdict of guilty. The court also found that the trial court properly refused to give a special jury charge because the subject matter was covered by the general charge. Finally, the court found that the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion in arrest of judgment because, contrary to defendant's contention, La. Rev. Stat.

Defendant appealed. Defendant's counsel, both orally and in brief, conceded that no formal bills of exception were timely filed and therefore the appeal was limited solely to errors patent on the face of the record. The court affirmed and held that there were no discernable errors appearing on the face of the record. The court held that the trial judge was without right or authority to sign the bills of exception when presented to him or grant defendant's motion for additional time within which to do so, because the express provisions of La.

The court held that the Structural Pest Control Law was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant forced an 18-year-old woman into his car, took her to a deserted location, and brutally raped her. He was charged with and convicted of aggravated rape in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 and was sentenced to death by electrocution. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that he was denied pretrial discovery. While defendant was entitled to production of written or videotaped confessions, the State had no confession, and defendant had no right to require the production of any other items of evidence. The court further rejected defendant's argument that the State was improperly allowed to introduce evidence that he had committed another rape in a similar manner. Evidence of a similar recent act was admissible for corroboration and to show intent and defendant's licentious disposition. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's claim that the death sentence for rape was unconstitutional.&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 authorized the death penalty for rape cases, and capital punishment for rape was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested for murder, convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court held that the first defendant was not denied his right to a preliminary hearing because a grand jury was deliberating on the same matter. The State did not deprive the first defendant of his right to inspect documents because evidence in the possession of the district attorney was privileged, and not subject to inspection until it was introduced at trial. The first defendant was not entitled to severance because he did not show that the second defendant's defense was antagonistic. Jurors who expressed that they did not believe in the death penalty were properly dismissed for cause. A police officer's testimony regarding the victim's statements were admissible as part of the res gestae because the declarations were made moments after the victim was fatally. A photograph of the victim was properly admitted because it was relevant to the coroner's testimony regarding the cause of death and it was used to identify the victim. The trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury with the first defendant's requested charges because they were vague and incorrect.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:961, 40:962 did not penalize the status or condition of addiction but rather the habitual use of narcotics leading to such a status. The court found that the intentional use of such drugs, or their use with guilty knowledge, was a necessary element of the crime of becoming an addict, which had to be proved by the State just as criminal intent was required to be shown in most other prosecutions. Thus, the court determined that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:962, 40:961 could have no application in the prosecution of a person for the mere status or condition of addiction that might possibly arise unintentionally or involuntarily.</SPAN></P>

The district court rendered judgment in favor of the taxpayer, holding that the imposition of the tax upon the taxpayer violated the federal Commerce Clause. The court transferred the Collector's appeal to the court of appeal. La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury commissioner testified that, in the selection of the grand and petit jury venires, the members of the jury commission made the selections from people they knew. Defendant argued that, by selecting the jurors from those they knew, the jury commissioners necessarily made their selections from a restricted segment of the population; and, therefore, a systematic exclusion took place and jurors were not drawn from a venire representing a cross-section of the community. The court found that such vague testimony was inadequate to support a contention of discrimination. In any event, because the parish had a population of only 29,939, it did not follow that a system of exclusion took place if they selected only from those they knew. It was entirely probable that between them they &quot;knew&quot; substantially all of the citizens of age who were eligible for jury duty. Moreover, blacks were selected in the same manner as whites, which refuted the argument that the action of the jury commission was discriminatory. The court held that, although the system employed did not produce proportional representation, it did not meet the test of invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:962. On appeal, the court found that the trial judge properly overruled a motion to suppress the evidence that served as the foundation for the prosecution, which had been predicated upon the contention that the objects were the fruits of an illegal search and seizure, because the arresting officers were justified in their belief that a felony was being committed by defendants. The court also found that the officers, being well trained in their profession and being knowledgeable of the methods and procedure of the drug trade, were justified in searching the house from which they had observed one defendant emerge under the circumstances above related in the belief that it was his place of operation and from which they would find the supply as fruits for which the arrest was made. The court found that it would have been unreasonable to require the officers to first secure a search warrant because someone else on the premises could have easily destroyed the evidence. Accordingly, defendants' convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was before the court on a writ of certiorari issued to the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit (Louisiana) to determine whether an employer who was obligated to pay compensation to an employee's surviving illegitimate children could recover such payments from the person responsible for the employee's death (the tort feasor), even though the children had no right to assert a tort claim against the tort feasor under La. Civ. Code art. 2315.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee, while driving a truck in the course and scope of his employment was involved in an accident with a car in which both drivers were killed. Relator natural tutrix instituted proceedings against respondent employer to recover workmen's compensation benefits due to the illegitimate children. The employer filed a third party demand against the tutrix's public liability insurer, seeking whatever compensation it would have been required to pay. Judgment was rendered in favor of the employer against the liability insurer for burial expenses and for any additional payments it would have been required to make in the future by reason of the compensation judgment. On review, the court rendered a judgment in favor of the employer, concluding that the employer could sue the tort feasor directly and recover workmen's compensation benefits paid to the deceased employee's illegitimate dependent child, even though the child did not have a tort remedy. The effect of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1101, 1103 was to give the employer the right to claim directly any compensation benefits he was obligated to pay as an element of damages resulting from the original tort against the employee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from a decision of the district court (Louisiana), which quashed an indictment that charged defendant with public bribery and declared the bribery statute,&nbsp;La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with public bribery for offering to give $ 25,000 to a public employee of the state, with the intent to influence his conduct in relation to his position as aide to the governor. The trial court based its decision on a Louisiana Supreme Court opinion that found the jury tampering statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:129, to be unconstitutional as being indefinite. The court held that the opinion was not controlling and that the bribery statute was constitutional. Defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because there was no word in &sect; 14:118 to modify &quot;influence,&quot; or &quot;position, employment, or duty,&quot; was without merit. The language of the statute made it plain that it applied only to persons who give or offer to give, or receive or offer to receive, something of value to a public employee or official specifically designated, for the purpose of influencing his conduct in the exercise of the duties of his position, employment or duty. Requiring the word &quot;official&quot; before position or the word &quot;corrupt&quot; before influence was redundant, for the statute itself conveyed the impropriety of the act denounced in commonly understandable language.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and held that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father brought a suit in the trial court (Louisiana) against the city, claiming medical expenses he incurred and damages on behalf of his minor son, arising from personal injuries suffered by the minor. The injuries arose when the son fell and lacerated his knee on a broken soft drink bottle while playing football in a park, which was owned and operated by the city. At issue was the validity of the passage of a relevant resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As La. Const. art. 19, &sect; 26 barred any suit against any municipal corporation in park operation matters, before filing suit the father had obtained the passage of a senate resolution granting the right to sue. The resolution, in addition to granting the right to sue, denied the city the right to file a plea of prescription or preemption barring the father's claim. Immunity of the city was specifically waived by the resolution. The issue presented was whether the legislature followed prescribed procedure in the passage of the resolution. The court found that the constitutionality of the resolution should have been upheld. The consent of more than three-fourths of the elected members of each house was obtained to extend the budget session to the subject matter of the resolution. If a separate preliminary proposal were necessary to consider the resolution's substantive matter, the court presumed that the proposal was voted upon and approved, for there was no requirement that action on a preliminary proposal be entered in the Journals or the Legislative Calendar. The Houses of the Legislature might have entered the action in their discretion. Silence of the journals was not evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed herein.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant was mentally competent. Two doctors examined him for two hours and concluded that he was able to understand the proceedings against him and to assist his counsel. Moreover, his answers were clear and rational. The court further found that defendant's confessions were given freely and voluntarily. He was fully advised of his rights. He was intelligent and sufficiently educated to understand these rights and unequivocally stated at repeated stages that he did not want an attorney.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Louisiana) that convicted him of aggravated burglary of a dwelling, arguing that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to quash the bill of information where the jury commission purposely excluded potential jurors who did not speak English and who were women and erred in admitting unlawfully seized evidence for the jury's consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of aggravated burglary. In affirming, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the bill of information. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 172 required that a petit juror be able to read and write the English language, and art. 172.1 excluded women from jury service unless a woman filed with the district court clerk a written declaration of her desire to be subject to jury service. The former requirement was a reasonable and nondiscriminatory regulation that operated equally against all persons tried by juries and afforded no advantage to the State that it did not offer to the accused. The latter exemption of women from jury service was a reasonable classification as women by nature are the center of home and family life. Acting in pursuit of the general welfare, the State may properly relieve women from the civic duty of jury service. Further, the incriminating evidence was properly admitted where defendant's wife consented to the search. Defendant's wife verbally acquiesced to the search and consented to the removal of the objects discovered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An ordinance was adopted that prohibited the sale of food on Sundays by large grocery stores and imposed a fine or imprisonment for each violation. The result of this ordinance was that all grocery stores but three were required to close on Sundays. A grocer who operated a large store filed suit to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. The district court granted the injunction, but the district court's decision was reversed on appeal. The grocer petitioned for a hearing. On rehearing, the court concluded that it previously erred in concluding that the grocer had an adequate remedy at law where he could raise the issue of unconstitutionality as a defense to prosecution. In vacating its prior decision and reinstating the injunction issued by the district court, the court concluded that the ordinance threatened an irreparable injury to the grocer because it interfered with his property right in the pursuit of his occupation. Because the ordinance interfered with the pursuit of a lawful occupation, the defense of a prosecution was not an adequate remedy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a sexual deviant with an intellectual deficiency, was charged with the murder of his neighbor, whom he bludgeoned with a hammer.

In affirming, the court rejected defendant's contention that his confession was improperly admitted where it was the product of physical mistreatment and coercion. While defendant's mother exhorted him to tell the truth prior to his confession, the evidence failed to establish any coercion or intimidation by the police; the mother's exhortation did not render the confession involuntary. The court further rejected defendant's contention that his confession was inadmissible due the failure of the police to advise him of his Miranda rights. The Supreme Court's Miranda decision was rendered subsequent to the murder and defendant's trial. The Miranda holding was not retroactive and was thus unavailable to defendant. Nevertheless, the evidence reflected that, before defendant made his written confession, police advised him that he had a right to remain silent, that anything he said would be used against him, and that he was entitled to a lawyer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, chairman of the Labor-Management Commission of Inquiry, sought review of a decision from the trial court (Louisiana), declaring that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 23:880.1-23:880.18, the enabling legislation that created the Commission, constituted an unconstitutional denial of due process to plaintiff taxpayer as guaranteed by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and United States Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature created the Commission to investigate possible violations of criminal laws arising out of labor-management relations in connection with a statewide shutdown of construction work that disrupted thousands of workers. The enabling legislation limited the Commission's power to investigate and fact-find, giving it no authority to make binding adjudications with respect to any violations discovered. The trial court held that the legislation was unconstitutional in its entirety, enjoined the Commission from acting, and enjoined the dispersal of funds appropriated to the Commission. On appeal, the court held that the Commission's duty was to investigate allegations of wrong-doing, hold fact-finding hearings, and report its findings to the state governor. The taxpayer was not deprived of his constitutional rights to due process, confrontation, assistance of counsel, or compulsory process because the Commission could not initiate criminal proceedings. Although the Commission's process was not secret, publication of its findings was not slander. The legislation did not violate the separation of powers clause in La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility installed underground electric wiring to supply electricity to a residential subdivision being constructed by the builders. The parties disagreed about which of them should bear the extra cost of installing underground lines as opposed to overhead lines. Upon review, the court held that the utility did not have an absolute and unqualified duty to extend the electric service without regard to cost, even though placement of the wires underground served the interest of public safety. The court compared the determination of who should bear the increased cost to a determination of a utility rate. As a home rule city, the City of New Orleans had the power to determine utility rates under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7 (1921), and New Orleans, La., Home Rule Charter ch. 16, &sect; 4-1604.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department expropriated certain property owned by the landowners and under lease by the lessees. The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the landowners for $ 37,442 subject to a credit thereon of $ 35,950 which had been deposited with the court at the time of the taking. A separate trial judgment in favor of the lessees for $ 12,000 was also rendered. The department sought review and the appellate court dismissed the appeal because the department of highways had not deposited the excess amounts of the trial court's awards with the registry of the court nor paid these amounts to the landowners and lessees. The court noted the property was taken for the construction of a public highway and the judgment increasing the amount of the award could not be regarded as divesting the department's title to the property. Because the department was not divested of title, it would be anomalous to conclude that the department's failure to deposit such monies in the registry of the court operated to deprive the department of its right of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, Jefferson Davis Parish School Board, sought review of the judgment of the trial court (Louisiana) which sustained plaintiff taxpayer's suit to recover taxes paid under protest, and held that the tax was being unconstitutionally applied to the taxpayer by the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed suit to recover taxes paid under protest to the board. The taxpayer claimed that the board had acted illegally by applying retroactively and in a discriminatory manner a tax assessment on the use of property brought into the parish by nonresidents after January 1, 1966. Residents owning property that was already within the Parish on that date were not being taxed for the subsequent use thereof. The trial judge sustained the taxpayer's position, and the board appealed claiming the controversy was within the court's appellate jurisdiction because the constitutionality and legality of the tax was at issue. The taxpayer argued that the only question at issue was whether the tax could be constitutionally and legally applied to it and other nonresidents who brought movables acquired prior to January 1, 1966 into the parish for use therein. The court held it did not have jurisdiction and transferred the appeal to the proper appellate court. The court held that where the tax itself was not assailed as an illegal or unconstitutional tax and only its application to the particular activity or subject matter was involved, it was without appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the appeal transferred to the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Democratic State Central Committee fixed at $ 600 the qualifying deposit or fee for candidates for nomination as governor in the Democratic primary. Plaintiff tendered his papers to qualify as a candidate for governor, together with a deposit or fee of $ 100. The Committee through its chairman refused to permit plaintiff to qualify because he did not submit the $ 600 fee. The court held that it did not have jurisdiction of the matter and ordered the case transferred to the proper court of appeal. The court noted that La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 10(4) granted the court appellate jurisdiction over appealable trial court cases involving election contests, but found that the case did not involve an election contest within the meaning of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:364. Under &sect; 18:364, an election contest was a claim by a candidate that but for irregularities or fraud he would have been nominated or entitled to enter a second primary as a result of an election which had already been held. In the instant case, plaintiff had been prevented from qualifying as a candidate for nomination in an election to be held in the future.</SPAN></P>

The property owner applied for remedial writs, which the court granted to decide the issue of whether the mayor's court had jurisdiction of the injunction proceeding. The court held it did not, and reversed and set aside the injunction. The court held that La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 51E (1921) made no specific reference to the power of the mayor's court to issue injunctions in order to prevent violations of city ordinances. Further, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 4837 specifically declared that a city court could not issue any injunctive order except to arrest the execution of its own writ.

Defendant was found guilty and appealed his conviction. The court held that the indictment was not required to name the owner of the calf, because it was not an element of the offense. The court also determined that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant, after seeing the fresh meat in his car, and defendant's conflicting answers given to the police, and therefore evidence of the meat was correctly admitted at trial. In addition, the court stated that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant a list of the prosecution witnesses. Further the court observed that defendant's right to voir dire was not violated when the trial court refused to allow defendant's counsel to question jurors whether they could disregard illegally obtained evidence, even if it constituted guilt.

Although plaintiff was also an elected parish representative, the court found that no conflict existed between La. Const. art. XIX, &sect; 27 (1921) and the Code with respect to the jurisdiction of the Commission over state elected officials because plaintiff was serving as a member of the Financial Commission in the capacity as a state employee and not as an elected official. Because the legislature amended La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that &sect; 14:106 violated freedom of speech, of the press, and of expression; and that its terms were too vague and indefinite to sufficiently describe the acts denounced. The court found that the bill of information, which charged defendant with having possessed, exhibited, and sold books, magazines, pictures, and drawings, fully informed of the nature and cause against defendant. It stated every fact and circumstance to constitute the offense charged and contained sufficient information to enable defendant to prepare his defense. The court found that it was not necessary for the information to contain the particular names of the magazines involved. It was immaterial what the names of the magazines were, and a recitation of specific names, particularly when there were so many, would have unduly extended the length of the bill of information. Defendant also claimed that he had not examined and did not know the contents of the material he sold and, consequently, could not have intended by his conduct to appeal to the prurient interests of average persons. Yet he introduced no testimony to show that the material was not obscene or that it had any saving graces.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had awarded no interest. The court's review was limited to the issue of whether the court of appeal erred in granting interest from that time when the condemning authority did not take possession of the property in question until after the prior payment of just and adequate compensation, was ordered by the trial court. The court reversed and set aside the judgment from the court of appeal granting interest from the date of judicial demand. Defendant was divested of the ownership of his land only after the judgment of the trial court was rendered, read, and signed, and the deposit was made in the registry of the court. Until the rendition of the judgment, differently from an action ex delicto, no debt was due him. Where such debt was not due defendant, no interest could accrue to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a television address and press releases, the candidate presented a transcript of his interview with a union member, reiterated in the member's affidavit, which asserted commission of crimes by a union business agent, who had been recommended to the union president by the candidate's opponent. The member asserted that he knew he &quot;couldn't get any help&quot; from the sheriff's office to prevent destruction of records by the agent, because he knew of &quot;money that had passed&quot; from the agent to the deputy. On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court and reinstated the district court judgment in favor of the deputy. The court noted that the district and appellate courts properly found the statements to be false, and that all that passed from the agent to the deputy were union checks to charities and civic groups. The court held that words uttered were statements of fact, not protected opinion or fair comment, and conveyed an assertion of criminal conduct to the average listener, thus were defamatory. After finding the deputy to be a &quot;public official&quot;, the court found actual malice, based on an utter disregard for the truth or falsity of the statements, or their effect on the deputy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collector assessed the tax payor for a deficiency in income taxes, which was affirmed by the board of tax appeals. Subsequently, the collector brought a summary proceeding to distrain the tax payor's bank account. The district court granted the tax payor's exception of prescription and the court of appeal affirmed. The court reversed both judgments. Specifically, the court held that the course of the three-year constitutional prescription on assessing taxes had been interrupted under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1580 when the collector assessed a deficiency for income taxes against the tax payor. Furthermore, the court found that once the running of prescription was interrupted by the collector assessing an income tax deficiency, pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 3518 and 3519, the same prescription did not start running anew as soon as the proceedings were concluded by the rendition of judgment. As such, the court held that the collector's assessment against the tax payor was a judgment under La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court found that defendant was not placed upon such guard as he could intelligently have defended himself of the crime with which he was charged because of its unclarity. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and overruled the motion to quash. The court thought that the legislature in defining the offense of contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:92(7), as amended and reenacted by 1948 La. Acts 388, clearly intended to limit the offense to immoral acts involving sex. The court found that the words &quot;sexually immoral&quot; had an accepted meaning that was not susceptible to misunderstanding. The court concluded that La. Rev. Stat.

The court found that the facts established probable cause and warranted a reasonable basis upon which to make the arrests, search, and seizure. The court concluded that the evidence was properly admitted. Admission of defendants' inculpatory admissions and confessions was proper because they were freely and voluntarily made, Miranda did not apply retrospectively, and a 26-hour delay in bringing defendants before a magistrate did not constitute unnecessary delay. The court also found that the parish's abnormal method of grand jury selection did not violate defendants' rights because the equal protection clause did not guarantee equality between geographical areas.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants passed a resolution that approved the establishment of an educational center or university branch. The residents instituted a proceeding to enjoin defendants from carrying out the resolution. The district court held that the resolution was unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction that enjoined defendants from carrying it out. Defendants perfected an appeal to the court. The residents filed a motion to dismiss defendants' appeal on the ground that the court lacked appellate jurisdiction over the matter. The court denied the residents' motion to dismiss the appeal. The court determined that it had jurisdiction over the matter because defendants' resolution was an &quot;ordinance&quot; within the meaning of La. Const. of 1921, art. VII, &sect; 10(2). The court ruled that the term &quot;ordinance&quot; in &sect; 10(2) was used in its broad and general sense rather than in a restricted one. The court found that an application of the narrow meaning to the term &quot;ordinance&quot; would have rendered &sect; 10(2) meaningless with respect to boards and other subdivisions of the state, which acted only through and by resolutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accused challenged a decision of the District Court of the Parish of Cameron (Louisiana), which found her guilty of manslaughter and sentenced her to imprisonment for a term of 10 years. Defendant argued an error patent on the face of the record, that the indictment was fatally defective, and, in the alternative, that the indictment did not inform her of the nature and cause of the accusation. Defendant also argued prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused argued that although the indictment charged that she did &quot;unlawfully kill&quot; the victim, it failed to charge criminal homicide, as required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:3. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's decision stating that although the indictment did not charge a criminal homicide, the accused was informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against her by the whole indictment. The court stated that the indictment informed the accused of the specific, particular crime of manslaughter for which she was being prosecuted. The court stated that the indictment also informed the accused of the cause of the accusation against her, the date and place of the offense, and the name of the victim. Plaintiff state argued that the accused did not request an additional peremptory challenge after she had exhausted her 12 peremptory challenges and that the accused could not now urge that the district court's ruling compelled her to accept and be tried by an obnoxious juror. The court held that because the accused did not seek to exercise more than the 12 peremptory challenges allowed to her by law, she could not now complain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the accused's conviction and sentence, stating that no prejudicial error occurred at the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner conveyed an undivided one-half of the mineral rights in certain property to group one and the other half to group two. Those rights were then assigned to the assignees. The Commissioner then issued a pooling order for a unit created from part of the property, and an assignee commenced drilling within that unit. More than 10 years after the original conveyance, the owner purportedly conveyed the rights to part of the original property located outside the unit to group two. A year later, the Commissioner issued an order creating a new unit which included part of the property conveyed to group two. The assignees drilled a producing well in that unit, then brought the concursus proceeding. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court judgment. The court noted that the Commissioner was not empowered to affect group one's property rights outside of the unit. The court held that the assignee's drilling operations had the effect of interrupting the running of prescription on the entire property, not just within the unit, as would have been the case if such drilling had occurred without the Commissioner's orders.</SPAN></P>

Acts 290.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1964 La. Acts 290 established minimum prices for the sale of bottled alcoholic beverages by imposing mandatory markups from cost upon both the wholesaler and retailer. The markups were stated percentages of the cost price. The statute prohibited sales below the list, or minimum, price. The alcoholic beverage sellers attacked the statute as a coercive, price-fixing measure, outside the domain of the police power, and argued that it was substantially the same as 1948 La. Acts 360, which the court previously struck down. The trial court ruled 1964 La. Acts 290 unconstitutional, but the court reversed. On rehearing, the court held that the price regulation scheme of La. Acts 290 was substantially the same as that in 1948 La. Acts 360. The court rejected the argument that the statute promoted temperance and prevented price wars and ruinous competition. The record showed no &quot;ruinous&quot; competition. The court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional because it had no real or substantial relation to the general health, morals, or welfare of the people, and thus violated the Due Process Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heirs owned a one-sixth mineral interest in six lots of land after a larger tract was partitioned among the descendants of the land's original owners. In the partition actions, the heirs reserved an undivided one-sixth interest in the minerals underneath the larger tract, rights they leased to defendant assignee. The state's department of conservation issued an order designating a portion of the heirs' interests as non-drilling areas, later amending its order to create a new pattern of non-drilling units. More than 10 years after the partition of five of the lots but within 10 years of the reservation of minerals under the remaining lot, the assignee drilled a producing gas well. The heirs argued that the 10-year prescription of the mineral servitude on the five lots was tolled because the department's conservation order created a legal obstacle to the assignee's ability to use the servitude. On appeal, the court held that designation of non-drilling areas within drilling units created by the department did not constitute an obstacle to use of the mineral servitude and did not suspend the 10-year liberative prescription against the servitude.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board sought an injunction against the dealer to prohibit its advertising the sale of eyeglasses. The district court granted most of the relief sought, but the court of appeal deleted the advertising prohibition from the judgment. The issue was whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1065 prohibited a retail dealer of optical supplies from advertising the sale of eyeglasses. The court rejected the dealer's interpretation of the statute that it prohibited only the advertising of glasses for a price or for free. The court adhered to its view expressed in an earlier opinion that although retail dealers were exempted from regulations applicable to optometrists, the statute clearly prohibited any advertising of eyeglasses by retail dealers. The court also rejected the dealer's constitutional attack against the statute. The distribution or sale of eyeglasses was related to public health. The United States Supreme Court had held that a prohibition against the advertising of items essential to visual health was not contrary to the principles of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court agreed, holding that the prohibition was a reasonable exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(A)(4), which made adjectives with connotations of obscenity, &quot;lewd, lascivious, and sexually indecent,&quot; modify nouns having specific, clear, and well accepted meanings, such as &quot;dancing,&quot; &quot;posing,&quot; and &quot;body movement,&quot; clarified the statute. The court found that the amendment eliminated the vagueness and indefiniteness found in the previous statutory provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Louisiana Board of Alcoholic Beverage Control, sought review of the judgments of the Court of Appeal (Louisiana) in three consolidated cases, brought by plaintiffs, retail dealers of alcoholic beverages, in which the court decreed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:80(D) to be unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement to withhold wholesale liquor permits from the retail dealers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retail dealers alleged that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:80(D) was unconstitutional in that it discriminatorily imposed substantial and onerous burdens on the wholesale distribution of alcoholic beverages. The statute imposed requirements such as the maintenance of warehouse space sufficient to store specified quantities of liquor, of delivery equipment, and of brand representation with at least one distillery or manufacturer; the making of a certain amount of sales to retailers; and the requirement that such sales account for a certain percentage of the gallonage handled by the wholesaler. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court of appeals concluded that a real and substantial relationship did not exist between &sect; 26:80(D) and the prevention of injury to the public welfare, and found the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and reinstated the trial court judgment. It held that no showing had been made that the statutory requirements were arbitrary, discriminatory, or prejudicial, and that the requirements were reasonable. The court concluded that the dealers had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Collector sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed an exception of the three-year prescription provided by La. Const. art. 19, &sect; 19, an alternative plea of unconstitutionality of all state statutes relied on by the Collector as a basis for interrupting or suspending the running of the constitutional prescription, and an answer reiterating, in substance, the plea of prescription and the alternative plea of unconstitutionality. The court noted at the outset that it did not have jurisdiction over the case. The Collector asserted jurisdiction under the state constitutional provision that extended jurisdiction to cases in which the constitutionality of any tax, assessment, toll, or impost was contested. The court noted that the case at bar did not involve the constitutionality or the legality of the income taxes that the Collector sought to recover. The taxpayer did not contest the validity of the state income tax law; his only defense was that the claim of the Collector had prescribed. In his alternative plea, the taxpayer simply contended that, if the remedial statutes were applicable, then they violated the constitutional prescription.</SPAN></P>

The court found that its minimum price provisions were definitely related to the purpose that Act 290 sought to accomplish. The court further found that Act 290 violated neither the due process clause of the Louisiana Constitution nor U.S. Const. amend. IV.

Acts 153 to be unconstitutional and enjoining the Committee from taking any action pursuant to said Act, which amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:304.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act amended and re-enacted La. Rev. Stat.

The court annulled and set aside the judgments and dismissed plaintiffs' suits, holding that the Act was not unconstitutional. The court found that the title of the Act satisfied constitutional requirements and, thus, did not violate La. Const. art. III, &sect; 16 (1921). The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that the Act was unconstitutional for the reason that it violated the spirit and intent of the Home Rule Charter of the City of New Orleans authorized by La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 22 (1921). The court also determined that the Act was enacted by the legislature to secure fairness. Finally, the court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the Act was unconstitutional because it was a local or special law. The court concluded that the Act was a general law and, therefore, not violative of La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4 (1921).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original action involved an attempt by the gas company to obtain easements for a pipeline. Defendant landowners had applied to the appeals court for writs to prevent the &quot;quick taking&quot; of their property. The appeals court had refused their writs based on recent statutory amendments. The court in its original opinion had held that the legislative fiat abolishing suspensive appeals in all expropriation cases violated the limitations contained in the State Constitution. The court, after the rehearing, set aside its original decree and affirmed the court of appeals' refusal of the writs. The court noted that the constitutionality of a statute was presumed, and courts must uphold a law unless it clearly violated the constitution. The court concluded that the Constitution of Louisiana neither granted nor guaranteed the right to a suspensive appeal in expropriation matters.

One of the defendants was found close to the scene shortly thereafter and blood was on his shoes. This defendant, along with others, implicated the other defendant. These defendants were charged with armed robbery and aggravated rape. Police purportedly took statements from defendants regarding the crime. The matter proceeded to trial and defendants were convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to death. Defendants appealed and asserted a variety of errors including the assertion that the statements used against them were not free and voluntary statements. On review, the court focussed upon this contention and noticed that defendants appeared to have suffered beatings while in the custody of the police. The court found from the testimony of the officers themselves that defendants did not, in fact, dictate the statements as asserted. Due to this, and other reasons, the court afforded defendants a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basis of the taxpayer's allegation was that their properties were being assessed at a higher percentage of actual value than were those of the owners of similar properties in other parishes. They alleged this manner of assessment constituted discrimination. While their ultimate object was to have the property tax as applied to them declared unconstitutional, this object was dependent upon their ability to prove that the assessment was incorrect and illegal. Therefore, their real complaint was not of the tax as distinguished from the assessment, but was that their assessments were incorrect. A suit which had as an object to contest the legality of an assessment must have satisfied the conditions of the second paragraph of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1998. There was no allegation in the taxpayer's petition that any of them filed the sworn list or return of his property for taxation before April 1, and their suit, filed on December 28, was filed more than 30 days after the November 15 date required for assessment roll filing. As they failed to comply with the conditions prescribed for the exercise of their right, maintenance of the exception and dismissal of the suit was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for criminal trespass on the ground that section 14:63.5 was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed. On appeal to the supreme court, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for imposition of sentence. The court held that the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rested upon the party who assailed it. Thus, one who attacked the limited territorial scope or the classification of a statute had the burden of establishing that the restriction imposed by the Legislature had no rational basis. The court held that there was no equal protection violation because the equal protection clause related to equality between persons as such, rather than between areas. The guaranty of equal protection was not a demand that all state laws operate from boundary to boundary. It compelled no state to adopt an iron rule of territorial uniformity for legislation. The Fourteenth Amendment do not prohibit legislation merely because it was special, or limited in its application to a particular geographical or political subdivision of the state.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court rejected the contention based upon previous holdings which found that the short form was proper in a murder case because &quot;murder&quot; was a word of universal and common meaning, and no citizen of average intelligence could fail to understand the significance of a charge of murder preferred against him.

The court found that even if the practice was technically irregular, it was not such an irregularity that the proceedings of the jury commission needed to be invalidated. There was neither evidence nor allegation that the jury commissioners and the clerk of court were guilty of fraud. The court also found that the composition of the trial jury was not such that it deprived defendant of a fair trial, even though certain categories of individuals, such as the elderly and infirm, were exempted from jury duty as allowed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:174. Said exclusions took place as a result of the jury commission's action on an administrative level and constituted an administrative irregularity, but did not make a significant difference in the fairness of the trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer sought to enforce a non-competition clause against appellee former employee. Section 40:1270(B) provided that no licensed pest control operator could require any employee to sign an employment contract which would prohibit the employee from engaging in similar work upon the employee's resignation. Contrary to the employer's contention, the court held that the employment contract contained a negative covenant which prohibited or restrained the employee and violated the statute. The next question was the constitutionality of the statute. The trial court held the amendments to &sect; 40:1270 violated the title-body clause. It was clear that the amended title &quot;reporting termite control contracts; competition&quot; did not give any indication that a paragraph dealing with the new and totally unrelated subject matter of employment contracts was being added to the section.

The court ruled that the evidence established that the seized drugs were obtained without a prescription, which was one of the elements of the offense. The court ruled that defendant's objections regarding the bill of information were without merit, because it properly tracked the language of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1033, and specifically designated that defendant violated the statute by constructively possessing and controlling a barbiturate. The court further held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, because the meaning of a hypnotic or somnifacient drug was well known. The court also ruled that the exemptions in the statute did not deny equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because it set forth reasonable classifications of persons associated with the use of barbiturates in an effort to control the use thereof, and was a valid exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had denied the property owner's motion for a suspensive appeal and had rendered an order that favored plaintiff gas company in an appropriation action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A gas company sought a right-of-way over land so that it could construct a gas pipeline. The trial court approved the expropriation. The compensation the trial court awarded the property owner was $ 2,877.19, and the property owner was ordered to pay the cost of the proceedings. The owner timely applied for a new trial and moved for a suspensive appeal. The trial court denied both and found that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:13, as amended by Act 108 of 1960, the property owner was entitled to a devolutive appeal only. The property owner unsuccessfully applied for remedial writs below. This appeal followed. The court limited its review to the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:13 and La. Civ. Code arts. 2634 and 2636 (1960), which abolished suspensive appeals in all expropriation cases. The court found, among other things, that if a final determination on appeal reversed a judgment of the trial court that favored expropriation, but the property had been damaged, it would not be possible to make the property owner whole. Thus, the legislation violated La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 and La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident contended, among other arguments, that the City lacked constitutional or statutory authority to levy the charge, that the charge was a special tax that could not be levied without a majority vote of the electorate, that the ordinance was not a valid exercise of the police power, and further that the ordinance was discriminatory and violated his constitutional rights. The court reinstated its decree sustaining the validity of the ordinance. It held that it was within the police power of the City to pass an ordinance providing for the collection and disposal of garbage; that such an ordinance definitely provided for the health, welfare, and safety of the community; and that such an ordinance was clearly authorized without a vote of the electorate. The court also held that the charge assessed was not a tax, but was a service charge, for which there was no necessity of conformity to the constitutional and statutory millage provisions. The court also held that the charge affected alike all persons similarly situated, and was based on reason and was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and thus that it did not violate the citizen's due process or equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December 1962, the city published an ordinance assessing the owners' lots with the costs of paving a street. In February 1963, the city published a resolution providing for the issuance, negotiation, sale, and delivery of paving certificates secured by the unpaid assessments. On June 4, 1963, the owners filed an action for a judgment declaring that the paving assessment levied by the city was null and void on the ground that their property did not abut the improved street. The district court overruled a plea of prescription. The appellate court reversed. The owners appealed. The court held that the assessment of the owners' non-abutting property within the city was unauthorized because the city paved the street under a statute authorizing it to assess costs against property abutting the street. However, the court held that the action was barred by the 30-day prescription period of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:319. The court held that the action was untimely filed more than five months after the publication of the assessment ordinance and more than three months after the publication of the resolution issuing the certificates.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the heir's ownership of the property would be lost if the statute was valid. However, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it disrupted established land tenure, transferred land from persons holding clear titles, and defeated the reasonable expectations of landowners who had relied upon the law in effect at the time of conveyance. The court noted that the statute impaired the obligation of contracts and held that it violated the federal and state constitutions. The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and decreed that the heirs were the owners of the property and were entitled to the funds deposited in the registry of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by the police leaving his residence and walking two blocks to obtain illegal drugs. After making a purchase, defendant was arrested. The police then searched defendant's residence and found a morphine tablet, which constituted the evidence at defendant's trial for wilfully and unlawfully possessing and having under his control a narcotic drug. Defendant was found guilty and appealed his conviction. The court held that defendant could not attack the constitutionally of the state statute which found addition to drugs illegal, because defendant was not charged under this crime, and therefore did not have standing. The court also determined that the arrest of defendant was proper, because the police officers had probable cause that defendant had bought illegal narcotics. Finally, the court concluded that the warrantless search of defendant's residence two blocks from where he was arrested was a lawful search incident to an arrest, because the police believed that there was a direct connection between the place of arrest and his residence. The court upheld defendant's conviction, concluding that evidence obtained during the search was properly admitted at trial.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 47:241 to rule in favor of appellee Louisiana Collector of Revenue and conclude that the federal tax deduction claimed by the taxpayers was properly added to their net income reported, resulting in a state income tax deficiency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For the tax year at issue, the wife reported a loss on her federal income tax return, while the husband chose to pay the federal alternative tax. The husband's Louisiana ordinary income was offset entirely by his ordinary non-Louisiana losses. Less than two percent of his capital gains was attributed to Louisiana. The taxpayers filed a joint state income tax return taking a federal tax deduction based on a percentage of the federal alternative tax. The ratio was computed by placing their Louisiana income over their total income. The court rejected that their Louisiana income had a causal connection to the alternative tax. The court stated that it could not determine what their federal income tax would have been if their Louisiana ordinary income had not been offset by ordinary losses in other states. Additionally, it could not determine what their state income tax would been if their capital gains had been realized in Louisiana rather than in other states. Therefore, the court would not accept that the computed percentage of the federal tax paid was attributable to Louisiana income. The court found no error in its original decision affirming the Collector's assessed deficiency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a state senator, was indicted by the Grand Jury of West Feliciana Parish for violation of La. Rev.

Defendant filed a plea to the venue or jurisdiction of the trial court on the ground that no substantial element of the crime charged was committed in West Feliciana Parish. The trial court sustained the plea. On appeal, the State argued that the trial court erred in sustaining the plea because defendant initiated an order for tires paid for with public funds in West Feliciana Parish and the tires were also delivered in that parish. The court held that the statute applicable at the time the alleged crime was committed required that a substantial element of the crime take place in the parish where defendant would be tried and that all alleged actions of defendant that were substantial elements were committed in parishes other than West Feliciana. The court therefore affirmed the judgment of the trial court sustaining defendant's plea to the venue or jurisdiction of the West Feliciana Parish court.</SPAN></P>

The court found the duties of the city and the commission in preserving the Vieux Carre were mandatory, and the commission had no discretion regarding them. The ordinance in question which exempted a portion of the Vieux Carre from any regulation whatsoever, in effect, exempted it from the &quot;reasonable control&quot; that the constitution required the commission to exercise over the entire Vieux Carre.

On appeal from his conviction and sentence, defendant claimed that &sect; 14:47 was unconstitutional as a violation of the freedom of speech, per se and as applied to the criticism of a public official. The court found that &sect; 14:47 was not unconstitutional per se and that it further was not unconstitutional as applied to the criticism of a public official because it permitted the qualified privilege, regardless of whether the statement was true or false, and required proof of actual malice. The court found, however, that defendant was entitled to a new trial because the judge did not recuse the district attorney, as required. The court held that the recusal was required because the district attorney was, in effect, an injured party and had a personal interest in securing defendant's conviction, which violated defendant's constitutional and statutory rights to a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed. The court found that defendant's motion to suppress the morphine tablet and narcotic equipment should have been granted because the warrantless search of defendant's home was not a valid search incident to an arrest. Although police had reasonable cause to believe that defendant unlawfully possessed narcotics, a search of his residence two blocks from the arrest site was not within the bounds of a search incident to arrest. The court rejected the argument that the house was within the bounds because defendant left his house shortly before his arrest. The court held that the denial of bail to a narcotic offender based upon the length of sentence did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment and that defendant had no standing to attack the addition provisions of the narcotics law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On rehearing, defendant Collector of Revenue appealed an order of the trial court (Louisiana), which entered judgment for plaintiff taxpayers in connection with the imposition of taxes on the gain realized when they received property of enhanced value in Louisiana for the cancellation of stock in a liquidated corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were the sole stockholders of an out-of-state corporation. The sole investment of the corporation was an interest in lands in Louisiana. When the corporation was liquidated, the taxpayers surrendered their stock certificates and received an interest in the Louisiana lands. Based upon the increase in market value of the lands, the Collector of Revenue imputed a gain to each taxpayer and assessed a tax under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:159(H). The trial court found that the corporation conducted no business in Louisiana and that the assignment of a Louisiana situs to the stock was wholly fictitious and arbitrary, rendering the statute unconstitutional. The court held that it erred in initially holding that Sub-part F, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:241-245, contained the complete system for computing the income of non-residents. The court held the complete system was the entire chapter, and thus La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:159(H) applied. Because the taxing power exerted by the state bore a substantial fiscal relation to the opportunities and benefits provided by the state, the state gave something for which it could ask a return, and thus &sect; 47:159(H) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment for the taxpayers, rejected their demands, and dismissed their suit.</SPAN></P>

IV, &sect; 4. The court noted that even if the statute was a local or special law, it was not invalid per se where there was compliance with La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6. The court found that the legislature complied with the notice requirements under La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6, and held that there was no constitutional prohibition of such an enactment. The court noted that La. Const. art.

The court held that &sect;&sect; 15:17.1, :156 authorized the district attorney to conduct open hearings and the remedy for any abuse was legislative, not judicial. Where the legislature had not specified procedures for the depositions, the court set out procedures to be followed, holding the district attorney was required to allege to the satisfaction of the trial judge that a named and specific crime had been committed in the trial court's jurisdiction and was not time-barred. He was to be given reasonable time and opportunity to establish the crime's commission and, if he failed to do so, the hearings were to be terminated.

The court held that it lacked jurisdiction over defendant's appeal because under La. Const. of 1921 art.

The court held that because defendant's bill of exception presented a question of fact, nothing was raised for its consideration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water company claimed that it lost money annually, and it required a rate increase to expand its service to meet the expanded needs of the community.

Shortly thereafter, those affected by the rate increase sought a reduction, and the commission adjusted the water rates. On review, the court found that the contract between the water company and the town had the effect of law them. It could not be revoked unless by mutual consent, or for causes acknowledged by law, and it had to be performed with good faith. The court found that the citizens of the town were not subjected to undue hardship by reason of the increased rates. Rather, many of them actually derived benefits from the increased water facilities without increased taxation. The commission's action in reducing the water rates was unreasonable and subject to reversal. The water company proved all the elements of its case.

Defendant argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89 was unconstitutional in that it was vague and indefinite. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, stating that the legislature, in denouncing &quot;crime against nature&quot; did so for the obvious purpose of amending and further enlarging the common law definition of the crime and making its provisions more explicit and comprehensive. As thus amended and redefined, it was couched in language that an ordinarily reasonable man could well understand. The phrase &quot;unnatural carnal copulation&quot; that counsel pointed to in particular as being of obscure, vague, and indefinite meaning consisted of words of common usage and indicated with reasonable clarity the kind and character of conduct the legislature intended to prohibit and punish.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, Collector of Revenue of the State of Louisiana (&quot;Collector&quot;), appealed the judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), which ordered the refund of taxes paid by plaintiff, a foreign corporation, on grounds that assessment of such taxes was prohibited under 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was incorporated in Delaware and maintained it's principal place of business in Missouri. The only activities conducted by the corporation in Louisiana was that it sent traveling salesmen into the state to solicit orders for shoes. The orders were forwarded to the home office and shipped from there. The corporation did not maintain an office or a warehouse or other place of business in the state of Louisiana. The corporation paid taxes on its net income to the state under protest, contending that the state was barred under 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 from imposing taxes on a foreign corporation whose business contacts in the state were limited to the solicitation of orders. The Collector appealed the trial court's judgment favoring the corporation, contending that the tax was not a tax on commerce and that 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 was violative of the taxing powers of the state. The court disagreed, holding that Congress had both the rights to regulate commerce and to suppress taxes burdens that it determined adversely affected interstate commerce. The court held that the federal statute was clearly within the scope of Congress' plenary power over commerce.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance unconstitutionally deprived defendant of the use of his property without due process of law by interfering with his right and privilege to advertise in a manner determined by him and to promote the sale of his product in the competitive market.

On review, the court found that the meaning of the term &quot;Building Supply Materials&quot; was a matter of common knowledge, and it was not necessary for the legislature to give a detailed description of what it meant by the language.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were Texas residents with income in Louisiana. In their federal income tax returns, the taxpayers' reported ordinary income was completely offset by ordinary income losses. The taxpayers ultimately paid federal income tax of $ 385,550.73. In their Louisiana joint income tax return, the taxpayers claimed a deduction of federal income tax in the sum of $ 361,699.38, utilizing a ratio-method deduction in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:241. The state disallowed the deduction. The state allowed a deduction for the amount of federal capital gains tax on the Louisiana capital gains. The court held that the state properly disallowed the deduction claimed by the taxpayers. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:55, 47:241, the deductible federal income tax was that paid on state-taxed income. The taxpayers paid no federal income tax because their income was totally offset by their losses. The inclusion of Louisiana income tax on the federal returns did not change the matter, because that income was offset and not actually taxed. The taxing statutes were constitutional, as they provided for deductions for reasonable and ordinary expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating the Uniform Narcotic Drug Law and sentenced to five years. Defendant appealed. The court held that the indictment was not fatally defective because indictment followed the language of the statute. La. Rev. Sat. Ann. &sect; 40:962 was constitutional because it defined the crime with sufficient precision to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice as to what conduct was criminal. A witness's testimony regarding the purchase of barbiturates was part of the res gestae. Thus, the evidence was admissible although it tended to disclose an offense other than that charged. Testimony from a deputy sheriff that he found barbiturates in defendant's possession the day prior to the arrest was admissible to show defendant's guilty knowledge and to rebut any inference that the crime charged was committed by accident or mistake. Evidence at trial that the accident occurred at Plaisance was evidence that the crime occurred in the parish where the action was brought because Plaisance was a well known geographical place-name, appearing in the parish on standard maps of Louisiana and a court or jury could take judicial notice of geographical facts.</SPAN></P>
