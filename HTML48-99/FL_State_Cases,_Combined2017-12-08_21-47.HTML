<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a foreign corporation, appealed the decision from the First District, Alachua County, Court of Appeal (Florida) that reversed the order of the trial court and found that because respondent alleged that petitioner entered into a contract with him in Florida, the requirements of Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent filed an action in Florida, alleging that an agent of petitioner, a foreign corporation, hired respondent to assist it in collecting an account. The trial court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, finding that respondent did not have the minimum contacts with the state. The appellate court reversed, finding that because petitioner was alleged to have entered into a contract in Florida, the requirements of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48.193(1)(g) had been met, and thus minimum contacts with the state was not needed. The appellate court certified a conflict with other appellate courts. The court held that &sect; 48.193 merely established Florida's basis for jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant. However, the federal constitutional requirement of minimum contacts had to be met, based on whether petitioner's conduct in the state was such that it could reasonably expect to be haled into court in Florida. Although respondent alleged sufficient facts to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement, petitioner denied the allegations. Therefore, the court remanded the case for the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to this procedure, minor petitioned for a waiver of parental consent under the judicial bypass provision of Fla. Stat. ch. 390.001(4)(a)(1988). The trial court appointed counsel for minor and guardian ad litem for the fetus. Guardian ad litem argued that the judicial bypass portion of the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The district court found that the statute's judicial alternative to parental consent was unconstitutionally vague. Guardian ad litem sought review. Minor legally had abortion but because the questions raised were of great public importance and likely to recur, the court accepted jurisdiction. The court affirmed the judgment and found that the statute was invalid under the Florida constitution. The statute failed to provide adequate procedural safeguards and the statute did not have the least intrusive means of furthering the state's interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A pregnant minor petitioned for a waiver of parental consent under a judicial bypass provision in order to obtain an abortion. The trial court appointed counsel for the minor and appellant guardian ad litem for the fetus and conducted a hearing. The trial court found that the judicial bypass provision of Fla. Stat. ch. 390.001(4)(a) was unconstitutional because it failed to make sufficient provision for challenges to its validity, was vague, and made no provision for testimony to controvert that of the minor. In addition, the trial court denied the minor's petition and required her to obtain parental consent. The appellate court declared ch. 390.001(4)(a) entirely unconstitutional, quashed the trial court's order requiring parental consent, and dismissed the petition. Appellant sought review. The court found that ch. 390.001(4)(a) failed because it intruded upon the privacy of the pregnant minor from conception to birth and was not the least intrusive means of furthering the state interest. In addition, the court found that ch. 390.001(4)(a) failed to provide adequate procedural safeguards because it did not make any exception for emergency or therapeutic abortions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant newspaper appealed from the decision of the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) that (a) upheld the entry of partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff parents in an action, brought under Fla. Stat. ch. 827.07 (1981), alleging tortious public disclosure of private facts regarding plaintiffs being acquitted of child abuse allegations and (b) ruled that ch. 827.07 was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A week after plaintiff parents were acquitted of child abuse charges, defendant newspaper published a story about the case and the evidence that was presented. Ten days later, defendant published another story, retracting the description of some of the evidence that was presented at plaintiffs' trial. Plaintiffs then sued defendant for, inter alia, invading their privacy by public disclosure of private facts, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.07 (1981), which concerned the confidentiality of child abuse proceedings. Plaintiffs were granted partial summary judgment on this claim and the appellate court affirmed, ruling ch. 827.07 was valid under U.S. Const. amend. I. Defendant appealed. In quashing the decision in favor of plaintiffs, the court ruled that the information involved here did not involve purely private facts, but was of legitimate public concern. The public had an interest in media coverage of judicial functions; thus, on these facts, defendant could not be held liable. The court made no ruling concerning the constitutionality of ch. 827.07.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision in favor of plaintiffs was quashed, without reaching the question regarding the constitutionality of the statute, because, under the facts of this case, the information disclosed by defendant was of legitimate public concern and did not involve purely private facts; society had an interest in media coverage of judicial proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee county proposed a bond issue to be secured by prior lien upon and pledge of county gas tax, voted gas tax, and local option gas tax, appellant state filed suit to prevent the issue absent a voter referendum. Lower court found for appellee, and appellant sought review. Court held that since no ad valorem tax revenues were pledged, appellee was exempt from the constitutional requirement of securing voter approval, but found that it was still possible that appellee's own charter required approval of the bond issue by referendum. Pursuant to Sarasota, Fla., County Charter &sect; 4.3.E, court held that since the taxes in question were received by appellee and spend locally, the bond issue was invalid without first being submitting to referendum. Finally, court held that appellee's argument that its charter conflicted with state law was unpersuasive, since the provisions at issue were not incompatible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of a decision from the Second District Court of Appeal, Polk County (Florida). The appeals court affirmed the imposition of a lien on petitioner for the appointment of services of counsel after petitioner was charged with escaping or attempting to escape from prison in violation of Fla. Stat. &sect; 944.40 (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of escaping or attempting to escape from prison in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.40 (1985). Petitioner had executed an affidavit of insolvency and requested appointed counsel; petitioner also authorized the trial court to impose a lien for the services of counsel without notice of a hearing. The trial court imposed a lien at sentencing and gave petitioner 30 days to challenge the amount of the lien. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that petitioner's affidavit of insolvency waived the notice and hearing rights of Fla. Stat. ch. 27.56(7) (1985). The court affirmed the imposition of a lien. The court agreed with petitioner that the court of appeals erred in relying on the waiver in the affidavit of insolvency. However, the trial court gave petitioner 30 days to object and to ask for a hearing pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.720(d)(1). Petitioner's failure to object or to request a hearing constituted a valid waiver. Further, petitioner could only have challenged the amount of the lien, not the actual imposition of the lien, because imposing such a lien was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the imposition of a lien on petitioner inmate for the appointment of services of counsel but disagreed with the reasoning of the appeals court. Petitioner's affidavit of insolvency did not waive petitioner's notice and hearing rights. However, petitioner was given the proper time to object to the amount of the lien, and petitioner's failure to do so constituted a valid waiver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the state of Florida, sought review of a decision from the District Court of Appeal (Florida), which set aside a forfeiture associated with respondent's possession of cocaine. The decision was premised on a holding that a forfeiture of a vehicle was only justified if the use of that vehicle played some part in carrying out a criminal transaction involving the illegal drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Discovered in possession of cocaine while in his car, respondent was arrested for possession of cocaine; the police took his automobile into custody, and timely filed a petition for forfeiture. Respondent admitted possessing the cocaine for his own use. The district court set aside the forfeiture, holding in order to justify a forfeiture, the use of the vehicle must have played some part in carrying out a prohibited criminal transaction involving the contraband drugs more than remotely incidental to an occupant's possession of illicit drugs for purely personal use. The court held, pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 932.702(4), 932.703(1), 932.701(2)(a)-(d), that possessing drugs, even solely for personal use, subjected individuals not only to criminal penalties but also to forfeiture of the vehicle, boat, or aircraft in which the drugs were found. It made no difference whether the drugs were on the seat, in the console, or in the occupant's pocket. Accordingly, the decision of the district court was quashed, and the case was remanded for reinstatement of the forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

P. 1.442 with a rule that imposed sanctions on parties who refused a bona fide offer of settlement prior to trial based on computations comparing the settlement offer to the actual verdict. The Board of Governors of the Florida Bar rejected the proposed rule and recommended that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 768.79 and 45.061 be declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court withdrew Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442, effective January 1, 1990, and replaced it with a new rule. The court rejected the rule proposed by the Civil Procedure Rules Committee that would alter the procedure by which parties are sanctioned for failure to accept bona fide offers of settlement prior to trial by requiring a sanction equal to 15 percent of an unaccepted offer to pay any time the jury verdict is less than 75 percent of the offer; and 15 percent of an unaccepted offer to accept any time the jury verdict is more than 125 percent of the offer. The court agreed that the proposed rule raised serious question of whether the court would be impinging on the legislature if it adopted a procedural sanction of this type. Instead the court adopted a rule that permitted sanctions based on costs and attorney fees whenever an offer of judgment was unreasonably refused and the subsequent judgment was disproportionate to that offer by more than 25 percent. The court declined to address the constitutionality of the purely substantive aspects of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 768.79 and 45.061, but held that where they were inconsistent with new rule, the new rule would supercede .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a certified question appeal, petitioner state hospital sought review of a judgment from the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) that held that petitioner, which had established a self-insurance trust fund, had waived sovereign immunity up to the maximum amount in the fund.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a certified question appeal, the court held that a government hospital, which had established a self-insurance trust fund, had not waived sovereign immunity against claims up to the amount of the fund under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 286.28 (1979). Respondent was injured at petitioner's hospital. Petitioner admitted liability and stipulated actual damages of $ 2.5 million, but maintained that under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 768.28(5) (1980), their legal liability was limited to $ 50,000. The court rejected respondent's argument that petitioner, by establishing a self-insurance fund, had waived its sovereign immunity up to the limits of the fund. The court found that self-insurance was not the same as insurance when there was no contract with an insurer and no shifting of the burden of risk. The court concluded that petitioner's self-insurance fund could not be equated with commercial insurance for purposes of determining the waiver of sovereign immunity under &sect; 286.28. The court quashed the portion of the judgment that conflicted with this ruling and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The district court concluded Chapter 76-432 was valid. Petitioners challenged the decision. The court noted, under &sect; 11(a)(1), no special law or general law of local application pertaining to election, jurisdiction, or duties of officers, except officers of municipalities, chartered counties, special districts, or local governmental agencies was permitted. The court held that a school board member was an officer for purposes of &sect; 11(a)(1). Because the state constitution and the state legislature, through various statutes, distinguished between school boards and special districts, the court held a school board was not excluded from the operation of &sect; 11(a)(1) as a special district.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, under sentence and warrant of death, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, requested a stay of execution, and appealed from the denial by the Duval County Circuit Court (Florida) of her Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion to vacate or modify the judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the penalty phase of defendant's trial, the victim impact evidence was impermissibly presented to the jury. Defendant's counsel vigorously objected. After defendant's direct appeals, the United States Supreme Court held that presentation of victim impact evidence to a jury in a capital case violated the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The change in interpretation of the law was so significant that, where objection was made during trial, the case was given retroactive application. Rather than focusing the jury's attention on the defendant's character and the circumstances of the crime, the victim impact evidence diverted the jurors' attention to the victim's character and reputation and the effect of his death. The court could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have recommended a sentence of death had it not heard the victim impact evidence. Therefore, the court vacated the sentence and ordered a new sentencing proceeding to be held before a newly empanelled jury. The court found nothing in the record to support claims of a deficient psychiatric evaluation or ineffective assistance of counsel, and the Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the habeas corpus petition, vacated the death sentence, and remanded the case for resentencing, as the victim impact evidence had been presented to the jury during the penalty phase of defendant's trial, over her counsel's objection. The court affirmed the trial court's denial defendant's motion for relief because the record did not support her claims of a deficient psychiatric evaluation or ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court found a lack of prior significant criminal activity, that appellant's mental state was the major contributing factor in the killing, that mental health experts agreed that the circumstances under which appellant was living impaired his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, and that the record showed appellant's genuine remorse. The court also found testimony that appellant was a good employee, that he cared deeply for the deceased child, and that he normally was not abusive to the children. The court held that any one or two of these factors might not have been sufficient to result in a reversal on proportionality grounds, but the entire picture of mitigation and aggravation was that of a case which did not warrant the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, petitioner was charged with three counts of sexual battery upon children 11 years of age or younger. The incidents allegedly occurred between June 1, 1975, and June 1, 1976, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (Supp. 1974 and 1975). Petitioner filed motions to dismiss all three counts, alleging that the crimes were no longer &quot;capital&quot; because the death penalty could not have been imposed, and therefore, the statute of limitations had expired for the offenses charged. The trial court granted the motions. Respondent state appealed to the district court of appeal, which reversed and remanded the case. Petitioner sought review because of express and direct conflict with other case law. The district court of appeal correctly concluded that the limitations period in effect at the time of the incident that gave rise to the criminal charges controlled the time within which prosecution had to have begun. Death was a possible penalty at the time of commission of the crimes at issue; thus, no statute of limitations controlled the prosecution of the offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a white man, was convicted of burglary and four counts of sexual battery. On appeal, he challenged the trial judge's refusal to dismiss the jury on the ground that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to strike all three black persons on the prospective jury. The district court of appeal held that petitioner did not have standing to raise the issue because he was not of the same race as the jurors who were challenged. Additionally, the record did not demonstrate that the challenges had been exercised on a racial basis. The state supreme court held that under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, it was unnecessary that petitioner, who objected to peremptory challenges directed to members of a cognizable racial group, be of the same race as the jurors who were being challenged. The court added that race could be relevant in determining whether the challenges were being unconstitutionally exercised because of group bias. The court further held that the prosecutor did not carry the burden of showing that his challenges of two jurors were not exercised because of their race.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County (Florida), which convicted him of two counts of first degree murder and twice sentenced him to death. Additionally, he was convicted and sentenced on four counts of robbery with a firearm, attempted first degree murder with a firearm, and aggravated assault with a firearm. Appellant raised three issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted, among other crimes, of two counts of first degree murder, and for which he received two death sentences. Appellant, who was black, challenged that order and raised several issues. One issue concerned the use of a special redistricting process as adopted in an administrative order to select the jurors in appellant's case, which resulted in appellant's county being divided into two jury districts for the eastern and western parts of the county. The court found that the record did not establish any intentional discriminatory conduct in the adoption of the administrative order and the creation of the jury districts. The effect of the administrative order, however, did create districts that resulted in an unconstitutional systematic exclusion of a large portion of the black population from the jury pool of the district from which the jury for appellant's trial was drawn. The court also agreed with appellant that he was denied equal protection, because the predominantly black district allowed an offender charged there to choose where to be tried, while the predominantly white district where appellant was charged did not. The order was reversed for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for two counts of first degree murder was reversed for a new trial because the court found that an administrative order that created special districts for jury selection caused an unconstitutional exclusion of a large portion of the black population from the jury pool of the district from which the jury for the trial of appellant, a black, was drawn. The jury districts also posed an equal protection violation as well.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 849.09 (1985) to be constitutional and certified a question regarding whether the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, prohibited Florida from interfering with the sale of out-of-state lottery tickets within its borders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent sought an injunction prohibiting petitioners' advertisement and promotion of the sale of out-of-state and foreign nations' lottery tickets, alleging a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 849.09 (1985). The trial court denied the request and declared ch. 849.09 unconstitutional under the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I. &sect; 8. The appellate court reversed, certifying a question regarding whether U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, prohibited Florida from interfering with the sale of out-of-state lottery tickets within its borders. The supreme court approved the reversal, holding that ch. 849.09 did not violate the commerce clause and that Florida was not prohibited from regulating the sale of out-of-state lottery tickets within its borders. The court ruled that ch. 849.09 regulated evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest where it forbade Florida and out-of-state citizens alike from selling lottery tickets and had only an incidental effect on interstate commerce. Chapter 849.09 was not preempted by federal legislation or as a matter requiring uniform regulation, and selling lottery tickets through the mails and across state lines was unlawful under federal law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the appellate court's ruling that a statute prohibiting the unauthorized sale of out-of-state lottery tickets within Florida's borders was constitutionally valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court was required to review a decision of the district court of appeal which declared unconstitutional Fla. Stat. ch. 550.355(2) (1987) as a special law in the guise of a general law and found it had been enacted in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. The statute dealt with simulcasts of horse races. The district court determined that the statute was fatally defective even as a general law under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 11(b), because there was no reasonable relationship between the express class characteristics enumerated in the statute and the purpose of the legislation. The supreme court agreed with the district court on both points and affirmed its decision. Based on the criteria of the statute, only one county would ever fall within the statutorily designated class of counties eligible for licensure of a facility, thus making the statute a special law. The court also noted that because the primary purpose of ch. 550.355(2) was the establishment of facilities for the receipt of simulcast horse races, there was no important and necessary state function to justify classifying the statute as a general law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant governor argued that his veto of portions of a line item referred to in an appropriations bill, but only appearing in so-called intent documents, was valid because the letter transmitting the intent documents expressly incorporated the intent documents into the appropriations bill. The court disagreed, ruling that the vetoed items were not specific, identifiable items adopted by appellee legislature in the appropriations bill and did not meet state constitutional requirements that vetoes only apply to specific appropriations that were part of an appropriations bill. Explaining, the court held that the intent documents were not part of the appropriations bill enacted by appellee, because Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 216.181(1)(1988) unequivocally and unambiguously provided that the statement of intent could not appropriate funds. Not being part of the appropriations bill, appellant's veto could not reach the intent documents or the contested portions of the line item, the court added. The court concluded that the statement of intent merely provided guidance on how appropriations should be spent, ruling that only specific appropriations in an appropriations bill were enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed expunging appellant governor's veto of portions of specific appropriations enacted by appellee legislature, because portions vetoed, incorporated by reference into appropriations bill from intent documents, were invalid, because intent documents -- statutorily barred from allocating funds -- were not part of appropriations bill that a gubernatorial veto could constitutionally reach, but mere documents of guidance.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 564.06 and 565.12 (1988) unconstitutional under the commerce clause. The question was certified to the court by the First District Court of Appeal (Florida).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, an importer and a distributor of alcoholic beverages, filed suit contending that an import tax on imported alcoholic beverages violated the commerce clause, the export-import clause, and the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. The trial court found the U.S. Const. amend. XXI purposes allegedly served by the legislation were illusory and, therefore, insufficient to validate the discriminatory tax. Appellants, a state director and two in-state alcohol producer intervenors sought review. The lower appellate court certified the action to the court herein. The court held that the interests which the state maintained were furthered by this legislation were not substantial enough to outweigh the federal interest in free and unrestricted trade among the several states. Inter alia, the court found, the asserted interest in enhancement of the state's regulatory control over the distribution chain of wines and distilled spirits was likewise insufficient to outweigh the clear federal interest implicated. The court affirmed the lower court's decision that Fla. Stat. ch. 564.06(1 -10) (1988) and Fla. Stat. ch. 565.12(1 - 5) (1988), were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of appellees finding amendments to state's alcoholic beverage tax laws unconstitutional under the commerce clause. The court upheld the trial court's finding that the amendments discriminated against interstate commerce. The court held the state's Twenty-first Amendment interests were not sufficiently implicated to allow a clearly discriminatory tax scheme to stand.</SPAN></P>

The district court concluded the action was barred by the statute of repose contained in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.11(4)(b) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed a complaint against respondent hospital and physicians, alleging respondents' negligent treatment caused severe brain damage in petitioners' child. The district court dismissed petitioners' action, holding it was barred by the statute of repose contained in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 95.11(4)(b) (1975). Petitioners argued the ten-year lapse between the birth of the child and the filing of the complaint was excusable because they were unable to discover the facts and circumstances surrounding prenatal and obstetrical care and the care rendered during birth. The court noted, under &sect; 95.11(4)(b), a statute of repose of seven years was applicable where there was an allegation that fraud, concealment, or intentional misrepresentation of fact prevented discovery of the negligent conduct. Because the legislature found an overriding public necessity in its enactment of &sect; 95.11(4)(b), and no less stringent measure would have obviated the problems the legislature sought to address, the court held the statute was constitutionally enacted and barred petitioners' medical malpractice action. Accordingly, the district court's decision was approved.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a long-term lessee that subleased an automobile service station to a dealer and was the wholesale supplier of products to the dealer. Petitioner claimed it was entitled to business damages under Fla. Stat. ch. 73.071(3)(b) (1985) after respondent state transportation department instituted eminent domain proceedings as to part of the property. The court found that petitioner was not entitled to business damages under ch. 73.071(3)(b). Petitioner did not have the requisite physical existence on the condemned property to be entitled to business damages. The employees of the service station were employees of the dealer, not petitioner. Operating losses incurred by the service station were borne by the dealer. Petitioner did not possess a license to do business at the location and did not sell gas to the public at that location. The fact that ch. 73.071 distinguished between wholesalers and retailers did not violate equal protection because it did not create an unreasonable, unconstitutional classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered in the negative the certified question of whether a lessee of property and wholesale supplier of products to a sublessee who actually operated a retail business on the property was entitled to business damages after the property was partially taken by eminent domain proceedings. A wholesaler was entitled to business damages only if it were conducting its wholesale business on the condemned property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon application for review of the decision of the District Court of Appeal, Third District, Dade County (Florida), which reversed an order that struck respondent's probate claim for failing to file notice of an independent action pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 733.705(3) (1985), which directly conflicted with Fla. R. Prob. &amp; Guardianship P. 5.065, which required petitioner personal representative to file the notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the district court's order reversing the probate court's order. Petitioner, the personal representative of an estate, objected to respondent's claim against the estate, and respondent filed an independent action, but failed to file a notice with the probate court under Fla. Stat. ch. 733.705(3) (1985). The probate court ordered the claim stricken, but on appeal the district court reversed, finding a conflict with Fla. R. Prob. &amp; Guardianship P. 5.065, which required the personal representative to file the notice. On review the court found there was a dual responsibility to report the action, and one did not negate the other. The court found that the notice requirement served to give notice to all persons interested in or potentially affected by the suit, was not jurisdictional, and did not warrant dismissal if respondent demonstrated that no harm to an interested party resulted by the failure. Dismissal is the most significant penalty possible and should not be used in rule violations where less severe penalties exist. Because petitioner had actual notice of the action and the same duty to report it as respondent, there was no harm by the failure to file notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's order reversing the probate court's order striking respondent's independent claim was approved because both parties had the responsibility to file notice, petitioner personal representative was on actual notice of the claim, and no harm was caused by the failure to file the notice. The court noted that the notice requirement was not jurisdictional, like the time requirement, and did not warrant dismissal absent harm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the St. Lucie County Circuit Court (Florida), which imposed sentences of death upon resentencing pursuant to a remand from the appellate court. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay statements in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(1) and that the admission of hearsay violated his right of confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The convictions were affirmed on appeal but the sentence was vacated. Upon remand, a new sentencing phase trial was held and defendant again received death sentences for the murders. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed the sentences, rejecting defendant's claim that his U.S. Const. amend. VI confrontation right had been violated by the admission of hearsay statements. Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(1) provided the trial judge wide leeway in admitting evidence in a sentencing hearing, including hearsay, subject to defendant's fair opportunity to rebut any hearsay statements. The hearsay admitted concerned the testimony of other witnesses in the guilt phase of the trial where those witnesses had been subject to cross-examination by the defense. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional as applied in this case and that the trial court had not abused its discretion in admitting the hearsay statements. The court also, sua sponte, reviewed the imposition of the death sentences and found that they were justified by several aggravating factors and the absence of any mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's death sentences, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting hearsay testimony in the sentencing phase regarding the testimony of other witnesses in the guilt phase of the trial. The non-testifying witnesses had been subject to cross-examination in the guilt phase and defendant had a fair opportunity to rebut the hearsay evidence in the sentencing trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with a lewd assault upon a three-and-one-half-year-old child, in violation of Fla.

Petitioner made pretrial motions to exclude the child victim's hearsay statements, to compel the child to testify, and to declare Fla.

Petitioner then entered a plea of nolo contendere, reserving the right to appeal the issues raised by his motions. The lower appellate court affirmed, holding that chapter 90.803(23) met the requirements of the confrontation clause of the federal and Florida constitutions and that the trial judge correctly applied the statute to petitioner's case. On appeal, the court affirmed. Chapter 90.803(23) was constitutional, and the trial judge correctly applied the provisions of the statute to petitioner's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to life in prison with a mandatory minimum 25 years of incarceration for sexual battery upon a child 11 years of age or younger, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (1985). On appeal, the conviction and sentence were affirmed. Petitioner appealed the intermediate court's ruling, which rejected petitioner's arguments that the trial court erred in admitting videotaped testimony of the alleged victim, petitioner's 3.5-year-old daughter, under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(23) (1985). Petitioner contended that ch. 90.803(23) altered the legal rules of evidence to receive less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense. He further contended that because he was disadvantaged by the retrospective application of the exception, admission of the out-of-court statements of the child victim pursuant to ch. 90.803(23) violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The appellate court upheld the intermediate court's ruling that affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence. The court concluded that the intermediate court correctly held that ch. 90.803(23) was constitutional and was properly applied.</SPAN></P>

Respondent refused certification because it determined that the legislature did not intend to allow a pardoned felon to hold the sensitive position of law enforcement officer. The court remanded, ordering respondent to reconsider petitioner's request for certification consistent with its opinion.

Stat. ch. 99.032.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant submitted qualifying papers so that he could run for county commissioner in Broward County, District #4. After learning that the seat for District #4 was not open, he changed his papers to run for District #3, even though he was a resident of District #4 at that time. Defendant was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 99.032 by knowingly and unlawfully qualifying as a candidate for Broward County Commissioner, District #3, even though he was not a resident of that district when he qualified as a candidate. Defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against him was granted, and plaintiff appealed. The appeals court affirmed the dismissal of the charge because the trial court properly held that ch. 99.032 was unconstitutional, as Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(e) enumerated the requirements for the office of county commissioner and that the legislature could not impose additional requirements. Thus, because Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(e) required residency at the time of election, ch. 99.032 was unconstitutional because it imposed an additional qualification for the office of county commissioner by requiring the candidate to be a resident of county when he qualified to run.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both parties challenged an order of the Fourth District Court of Appeal, which held that Fla. Stat. ch. 723.079(1) (1985) was unconstitutional and could not be used as a basis for finding that appellant mobile homeowner's association had standing to bring a counterclaim in appellee corporation's action for declaratory relief. Appellee corporation challenged the finding that the counterclaim could be maintained as a class action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both parties challenged the district court's order that a counterclaim filed by appellant association, which represented mobile home owners in a park owned by appellee corporation, was maintainable in an declaratory judgment action filed by appellee corporation. The trial court had found that appellant association was an appropriate class representative under Fla. Stat. ch. 723.079(1) (1985). The district court ruled that the counterclaim itself was suitable for presentation as a class action. However, the district court held that the statute was unconstitutional and could not be used as a basis for finding that appellant association had standing to represent the class. Appellant association challenged the finding that it was an improper class representative, and appellee corporation cross-appealed the finding that the counterclaim was maintainable. The supreme court reversed, holding that while the statute was unconstitutional because it constituted an intrusion on the court's rulemaking authority, the unique features of mobile home residency required adoption of a procedural format to allow associations like appellant association to represent members of such class of homeowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the portion of the district court's opinion that found the statute at issue unconstitutional and that found appellant association's counterclaim maintainable. The supreme court reversed the portion of the opinion that found appellant association an improper class representative. The statute was an unconstitutional intrusion on the court's rulemaking authority, and the counterclaim was maintainable as a class action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court in and for Brevard County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree murder, burglary with assault, and grand theft, and sentenced him to death for the murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim was murdered and his home was burglarized in January 1986. Defendant was indicted and a jury returned guilty verdicts for first-degree premeditated murder, felony murder, burglary with assault, and grand theft. The circuit court imposed the jury's recommended sentence of death for the first-degree murder, 40 years imprisonment for the burglary, and 5 years imprisonment for the grand theft. The circuit court did not enter adjudication on the felony-murder guilty verdict. Defendant appealed his first-degree conviction arguing that he was unconstitutionally indicted and found guilty of both first-degree premeditated and felony murder stemming from a single death. The court found that the murder was heinous, atrocious, and cruel because defendant planned the burglary and theft, planned violence to the victim in perpetrating the theft, brought a weapon to the scene, and after committing the felony, he concealed himself and waited for the victim to return because of his pique at the frugal results of the burglary. The court found that resentencing was necessary because the circuit court erred in failing to utilize the sentencing scoresheet in sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but vacated the sentences because it was not sure whether the circuit court properly considered all the mitigating evidence or whether it found that the aggravation outweighed the mitigation, and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after cashing a check purportedly written to him by the victim, a 42-year-old woman whose body had been found in the trunk of her car, which was hidden in dense woods. The victim had been strangled and raped. Defendant was convicted by a jury for first-degree murder and sentenced to death by the trial court. The supreme court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence because the court found no error in: (1) an unsworn juror's catching sight of defendant in the custody of the sheriff; (2) the jury being instructed by the judge by means of a note sent to the jury room; (3) permitting the introduction of rebuttal evidence of an uncharged crime; (4) finding that the killing was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel because the victim knew of her impending doom and was slowly strangled; and (5) finding that the killing was committed for pecuniary gain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a decision from the District Court of Appeal, Second District (Florida), which held for appellee landowner and declared Fla. Stat. ch. 337.27(3) (1985), which permitted condemnation of more land than necessary if it would reduce acquisition costs, unconstitutional. Appellant argued that ch. 337.27(3) satisfied a public purpose, and thus was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Florida's eminent domain laws, if only part of a property was condemned, its owner was entitled to recover, under Fla. Stat. ch. 73.071(3)(b) (1985), in addition to the value of the property, all business damages that resulted from the condemnation. If the entire property was condemned, business damages were not recoverable. Fla. Stat. ch. 337.27(3) (1985) allowed condemnation of more property than was necessary if the cost of doing so was less than condemning only what was necessary. The state sought to save $ 2 million by condemning all of appellee landowner's property at a certain location. The court quashed the judgment that declared ch. 337.23(3) unconstitutional. The court held that the allowance of business damages in ch. 73.071(3)(b) was a matter of legislative grace only; thus ch. 337.23(3) did not effect a taking of property to the extent of business damages, and did not implicate constitutional considerations unless it was arbitrary or capricious. The court held that the declared public purpose of ch. 337.23(3), which was to save money, was valid, and that ch. 337.23(3) was, therefore, not arbitrary or capricious, and not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decision in favor of appellee landowner, and held that the statute that permitted appellant state to condemn more property than it needed to implement a valid public purpose was constitutional. The court held that this statute, which effectively limited the damages appellee could recover for the condemnation, was not arbitrary or capricious, and thus constitutional, because it fulfilled a valid public purpose.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner argued the court had improperly failed to place limits on the scope of its delegation of political activity to the bar. The court first noted that, prior to making his application at issue, petitioner had proposed a state bar rule amendment, yet to be ruled upon, that prohibited the bar from engaging in political activities not directly related to the organization. The court also held that it had previously rejected a prior proposed amendment prohibiting the bar from engaging in any political activity. In refusing petitioner's application for appointment of a commission, the court nonetheless noted that other jurisdictions restricted the scope of a state bar's political authority to those activities directly related to the organization's purpose of regulating its membership. The court refused to decide precisely which of a state bar's activities were improper, but ordered the issue reviewed by the state bar in light of the decisions of other jurisdictions restricting the authority of their state bars.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's conviction for first-degree murder was affirmed but his death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment. Redirect examination of a witness within the scope of questions asked on cross-examination. A statement that appellant was involved with stolen jewelry was relevant to demonstrate a trust relationship between appellant and the inmate. No prejudice flowed from the evidence concerning insurance fraud. A statement that appellant was previously convicted of a felony which involved the use or threat of violence to another person was contained in a written report. The murder was committed for pecuniary gain. The evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the felony was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal, First District (Florida), certified an appeal from a summary judgment granted by the trial court in favor of appellee, the Office of the Comptroller for the State of Florida, in appellants' action for a refund of excise taxes they paid on alcoholic beverages they distributed in Florida. The trial court also denied mandamus and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged Fla. Stat. ch. 564.06 and 564.12 (1981 to 1984 Supp.), which imposed an excise tax on alcoholic beverages they distributed in Florida. Appellants argued that because the tax expressly favored alcoholic beverages produced from Florida-grown products by granting them tax exemptions, it was unconstitutional and the state was thus required to refund taxes to the extent it discriminated against interstate commerce. The trial court granted summary judgment against appellants. In light of a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that commerce clause restrictions applied to state taxing schemes that favored in-state manufacturers of such beverages, and its own prior decision, the court favored the trial court's conclusion that certain provisions of the taxing statutes violated the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held, however, that its decision was only to be given prospective application because an unreasonable disruption of state government would be caused by retroactive application and an unconscionable windfall would have accrued to appellants who had already passed the tax onto their customers. The decision below was approved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court quashed that portion of the district court of appeal's judgment that conflicted with the appellate court's decision. The appellate court held that the interpretation of Fla. Stat. ch. 447.309(3) urged by respondent public employers rendered the statute unconstitutional as an impermissible abridgement of the right to bargain collectively, noting that the granting to a local civil service board absolute veto power over the provision of a collective bargaining agreement rendered that agreement a nullity. However, the court noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 447.309(3) stood as it applied to conflicts between statutes or ordinances and agreements between public employers and employees through the art of collective bargaining. The appellate court remanded for disposition consistent with its conclusion that Fla. Stat. ch. 447.309(3) was unconstitutional as applied, noting that the administrative order was to be given only prospective effect because respondents were not to be held to have committed an unfair labor practice where the existing law in the district court of appeals had validated their position.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court of Appeals (Florida) certified for review three cases that raised questions as to the application of Florida's borrowing statute, Fla. Sta. ch. 95.10 (1979), to asbestosis claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court certified for review three cases that raised questions as to the application of Florida's borrowing statute, Fla. Sta. ch. 95.10 (1979), to asbestosis claims that arose from asbestos exposure in other states. The court noted that whether the borrowing statute would be applied depended on whether the claim had &quot;significant relationships&quot; with Florida. If there were no such significant relationships, the other state's limitations period would apply. The court further noted that under Florida law, a cause of action did not accrue for limitation purposes until the injured party discovered or had a duty to discover the act constituting an invasion of his legal rights; but that this was not the law in many other states. Applying these principles, the court found that in one case, the claim had a significant relationship to Florida, and so Florida's limitation period would apply; in another case, there was no such significant relationship, and the action was time-barred under the rules of the state in which the asbestos exposure had occurred. The court remanded the third case, finding that it could not determine whether the claim had a significant relationship with Florida.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Florida's borrowing statute did not apply to extend the statute of limitations for a claim of asbestosis that arose from asbestos exposure in another state unless the claim had significant relationships with Florida. Applying these principles, it quashed all three of the lower court decisions for reasons particular to each case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecution challenged a decision of the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) that concluded that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecution challenged a determination that Fla. Stat. ch. 849.25, which dealt with bookmaking, was constitutionally invalid to the extent that it permitted the prosecution as a felony of the same conduct treated as a misdemeanor under Fla. Stat. ch. 849.14. In concluding that the statute was constitutional and reversing the lower court decision, the state supreme court concluded that there was no appreciable difference between the discretion a prosecutor exercised when deciding whether to charge under one of two statutes with different elements and the discretion exercised when choosing between statutes with identical elements. While the prosecutor may be influenced by the penalties available upon conviction, this fact alone did not establish an equal protection or due process violation. Further, it was not unusual for criminal conduct to violate laws that overlapped yet varied in their penalties, and the state legislature traditionally left to the prosecutor's discretion those violations to prosecute and that range of penalties to seek in punishment of a criminal offense. The matter was remanded for a trial of appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court of appeal was reversed, for the sole fact that one state statute treated conduct as a felony that was treated as a misdemeanor under another state statute was insufficient to establish a due process or equal protection violation sufficient to render the former unconstitutional. The matter was remanded for trial the appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. After numerous state and federal court proceedings, petitioner filed for writ of habeas corpus requesting relief under Hitchcock. Petitioner alleged that the trial judge restricted his mitigating evidence and the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence to those circumstances listed in Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(6) (1975). Petitioner claimed that, even though he presented no mitigating evidence at sentencing, the trial judge and jury could have gleaned certain nonstatutory mitigating evidence from the guilt phase. This evidence included residual doubt about the extent of petitioner's participation in the crime and his guilt, the disparate treatment of petitioner's co-defendants, and petitioner being a father. Noting the weakness of the nonstatutory mitigating evidence, petitioner's waiver of presenting and arguing mitigating evidence, the overwhelming evidence of guilt, and substantial aggravating factors, the court found that any Hitchcock error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the court denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus and denied petitioner's request for a stay of execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court in and for Lee County (Florida), which denied his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion to vacate his conviction and death sentence. Appellant argued that counsel was ineffective, that the sentencing phase was tainted by the failure to consider nonstatutory mitigating factors as well as prosecutorial comment and jury instructions that denigrated the jury's advisory role.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court summarily vacated appellant's death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing, because the trial court limited its and the jury's consideration of mitigating factors to those statutorily enumerated. The court summarily affirmed the conviction, finding no ineffective assistance. The court then held that the role of the sentencing jury in Florida's capital sentencing process was indeed advisory. The court held that the jury instructions accurately stated the jury's advisory role, citing Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141 (1985), and did not disparage or denigrate that role in the sentencing process. The court acknowledged that it was constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who had been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant's death lay elsewhere. The court reiterated, however, that under Florida law, the judge was solely responsible for assessing capital punishment; the jury was not empowered with the final sentencing decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction, but vacated his death sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court held that appellant's sentencing hearing unconstitutionally failed to permit consideration of nonstatutory mitigating factors. The court held, however, that jury instructions and prosecutorial comment to the effect that the jury's role was advisory were correct and did not disparage the jury's role.</SPAN></P>

Further the court found that the prosecutor correctly stated during voir dire: that the judge is the sentencing authority and the jury's role, merely advisory. The trial court's instructions fully advised the jury of the importance of its role and correctly stated the law. The court further found that under Florida's death penalty statute, appeal was automatic and under Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(b)(4), governing capital appeals, the trial court retained concurrent jurisdiction for preparation of the complete trial record for filing in the appellate court. Since the trial judge's written findings were made prior to the certification of the record to the appellate court there was no error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, wholesale distributors and manufacturers of alcoholic beverages, brought an action against appellant, Department of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, which challenged the revised tax scheme in Fla. Stat.

Appellees claimed the preference and disqualification provisions under the new tax scheme discriminated in favor of local commerce and against interstate commerce contrary to the mandates of an applicable case. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of appellees, appellant sought review, and the appellate court certified the cause to the court as a question that involved great public importance. The court found the tax scheme placed a clear discriminatory burden on interstate commerce, and the state failed to justify in terms of legitimate local benefits other than the admitted benefits to local industry flowing from the statute; therefore, the challenged provisions violated the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 193.085(4)(1979), and the issue was whether the assessment was unconstitutionally discriminatory in that the similarly situated rolling stock of nonresident railroads was not similarly assessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, as private carline corporations, were in the business of leasing private railroad cars to shippers. The state's ad valorem taxing scheme taxed private railcar owners to the extent their cars were used in that state and taxed railroad cars of resident railroads on the basis of a formula that compared the amount of track in the state to the total track owned by the railroad. Nonresident railroads were not taxed in the state because their railroad cars retained tax situs in the states in which their parent railroad owned track under Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 193.985(4)(b)(1979). Respondents challenged the tax assessments of their rolling stock on the grounds that the statutory scheme discriminated against private carline owners because rail cars owned by nonresident railroads were not taxed in Florida. The court found the tax was not discriminatory because the taxing scheme allowed fair taxation of all railroad cars by sovereign states and avoided double taxation. The decision of the lower court was reversed and remanded to reinstate the tax assessment under &sect; 193.085(4)(b).</SPAN></P>

Respondents filed motions to control prejudicial pretrial publicity by preventing public disclosure of pretrial discovery information and by prohibiting public comment on the evidence and charges.

The trial court prohibited the release of the existing discovery materials and future discovery materials pending in-camera inspection, and petitioner newspaper company appealed. On appeal, the court approved the lower court's decision finding that there was no U.S. Const. amend. I right of access to pretrial discovery material. The court held that there was a statutory right of access to such material when it became a public record, but that statutory right had be balanced against the constitutional rights of a fair trial and due process. The court also held that there was no constitutional impediment to a court prohibiting prosecutors, defense counsel, witnesses, and other interested parties involved in the case before the court from making prejudicial pretrial comments which were intended for publication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a licensed podiatrist. He performed a procedure on a child to repair a flatfoot deformity. Petitioner discovered what he considered a defamation of him by a medical review committee in its determination not to allow the flatfoot surgical procedure by any podiatrist at the hospital where he practiced. Petitioner filed a complaint alleging that respondents libeled, slandered, defamed, and/or placed him in a false light by stating that he had performed an experimental surgical procedure on a child. He also alleged his due process and equal protection rights were violated. Summary judgment was rendered in favor of respondents. The district court affirmed the trial court on the ground that no such action could be maintained under Fla. Code Ann. &sect; 768.40(4)(1984). On review, the court found summary judgment in favor of respondents should be vacated to allow petitioner an opportunity to allege extrinsic malice or fraud. The court found it was evident that the relevant statute allowed a defamation action against a committee member or health care provider if a plaintiff could establish extrinsic evidence of malice or fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that summary judgment in favor of respondents should be vacated, and directed the district court of appeal to remand the cause to the trial court with directions that petitioner be allowed to file an amended complaint, finding that the statute in question did not totally abolish the defamation cause of action, and petitioner should be allowed to proceed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for first-degree murder, violation of probation, and his death sentence, asserting many errors in both the guilt and penalty phases. The state cross-appealed an order arresting judgment on a jury verdict of guilt for attempted sexual battery. The court affirmed the convictions, concluding that the evidence clearly and convincingly supported the trial court's evidentiary rulings regarding the admission of a bite mark identification and statements from defendant's cellmate about defendant's guilt. The court, however, reversed the order granting defendant's motion for arrest of judgment on a jury verdict of guilt for sexual battery, concluding that the reference of a statute that defined the elements of the charged offense in the state's indictment sufficiently placed defendant on notice of the charged crime. Finally, the court vacated defendant's death sentence and adopted the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment, holding that it was error to override this recommendation, as the facts of the case were not so clear and convincing as to warrant death and reasonable persons could have differed regarding the propriety of a death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tax appraiser and appellee tax payers brought an appeal and cross-appeal regarding a decision which held that Fla. Stat. ch. 192.307 (1985) was an unconstitutional deprivation of due process and equal protection. The statute set forth the method for ad valorem taxation of fee time-share units. Appellees claimed that the statute was unconstitutional because it placed time-share owners at a substantial disadvantage relative to other property owners in avoiding penalties for nonpayment of taxes and denied them a proper opportunity to receive notice and contest their taxes. The court reversed, holding that the statute was constitutional. First, time-share owners were treated the same as other multiple owners of a single parcel of real property. Also, there was a rational legislative basis to support the provisions for collection of ad valorem taxes contained in the statute, and the method of tax collection, the tax bill being mailed to one address, was not arbitrary and did not discriminate against the owners. Finally, the method of collecting taxes from owners was neither substantially different nor less protective than the method utilized for other owners of real property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a criminal case involving drugs, the state appealed an order that denied its request for writ of certiorari to review an adverse evidentiary ruling by the trial court.

The court determined that although Fla. R.

The substance was tested and identified as cocaine. Police obtained a search warrant for petitioners', husband and wife, residence relative to the prospective controlled delivery of the cocaine. A few minutes after the controlled delivery, police executed the warrant, arrested petitioners, and charged them with possession of cocaine. Petitioners sought to suppress the evidence on the grounds that it was the product of an unreasonable search and seizure, relying on the provisions in Fla. Stat. ch. 933.18 (1983). The trial judge granted petitioners' motion to suppress, but the appellate court reversed the decision. The supreme court affirmed the appellate court's decision and held that the 1982 amendment to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 brought the state's search and seizure laws into conformity with all decisions of the United States Supreme Court. The court concluded that there was probable cause to obtain a warrant to seize a package already in law enforcement's constructive possession and that law enforcement knew contained contraband.</SPAN></P>

However, the court noted that a decision of a court of last resort, which overruled a prior decision, generally operated retrospectively. The court then held that, because petitioner had not acted in reliance on the earlier decision that was overruled, the most recent case law applied to petitioner's suit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged a judgment of the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) that affirmed the dismissal of his suit by the trial court, arguing that the retrospective application of a judicial decision deprived him of a vested interest, the right to bring a cause of action, and thereby deprived him of his constitutional due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit relying upon a judicial decision declaring Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031 to be unconstitutional. During the suit's pendency, the state supreme court issued the Pullam decision, which reversed the prior decision and declared the statute constitutional. After plaintiff's claim was dismissed, plaintiff appealed, and a certified question was presented to the state supreme court regarding whether application of the Pullam decision to bar a cause of action that accrued prior to that decision deprived the plaintiff of his due process rights under the United States Constitution. In affirming the decision of the lower court and answering the certified question in the negative, the court concluded that plaintiff had no vested property interest, including a right to bring a cause of action, in any rule of the common law. Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031 provided a defense to a cause of action rather than creating one. At most, plaintiff had a mere expectation that he had a cause of action to pursue in light of the prior decision; the subsequent decision holding the statute to be constitutional could not and did not deprive him of any vested right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court judgment was affirmed, as plaintiff had no vested property interest in any rule of the common law. At most, plaintiff had a mere expectation of a right to bring suit; the retrospective application of a subsequent judicial decision declaring that no such right existed did not deprive him of any vested right in violation of his due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee noncitizen applied for a license to act as a business agent for firefighters' union, which represented the employees of appellant employer. Appellant opposed the application on grounds of appellee's lack of citizenship. The Florida Department of Labor and Employment Security (the department) granted appellee a license, finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 455.10 implicitly repealed Fla. Stat. ch. 447.04(1)(a) and the alienage restriction it contained. The court of appeal disagreed with the department's rationale, but it affirmed the department's action on a different ground. The court of appeal, held that ch. 447.04(1)(a) violated the equal protection clause, and the supreme court affirmed the judgment. Ch. 447.04(1)(a) involved alienage, one of the traditional suspect classifications, and was, therefore, subject to strict scrutiny. Because ch. 447.04(1)(a) did not advance a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means available, the statute was unconstitutional. The court rejected appellant's argument that an exception to strict scrutiny existed under the &quot;political function&quot; test, finding that a business agent's contact with public policy was indirect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, prison inmate, appealed decision which expressly declared valid Fla. Stat. ch. 921.161(1) (1985). Petitioner was arrested, indicted, and spent five years in custody at state mental hospitals. Subsequently, he was convicted of second degree murder and given a life sentence. Petitioner contended that the time spent in state mental institutions should be credited against his sentence. The trial court held the statute, which permitted credit for time spent in county jail, unconstitutional. The intermediate court reversed. In quashing the reversal, the court concluded that coercive commitment to a state institution was indistinguishable from pretrial detention in a &quot;jail,&quot; as understood in common and legal usage. The court declined to read Fla. Stat. ch. 921.161(1) as a statement that jail-time credit could only be granted for time spent in an institution formally designated as a &quot;county jail.&quot; That would infringe on interests protected by Florida and federal constitutions, resulting in violation of equal protection and due process rights. The court's clear obligation was to interpret statutes in a manner consistent with constitutional rights wherever possible.</SPAN></P>

He sought a writ of habeas corpus claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and sought a stay of execution.

The court denied the petition and the requested stay explaining that counsel's argument that petitioner was guilty of sexual battery was her attempt to point out petitioner's sexual problems as a mitigating factor justifying a life sentence. Under the circumstances, counsel's performance as to this issue was not deficient. Further, the court agreed with the state that petitioner's second challenge was not properly preserved for appellate consideration. Appellate counsel's failure to raise an issue not preserved for appellate review and which did not present a fundamental error did not amount to a serious deficiency in performance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a decision from the Third District Court of Appeal, (Florida) which affirmed summary judgment for defendant in a product liability action, alleging that legislative abolishment of Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1983), a statute of repose, should have been applied retroactively to allow plaintiff's suit and that case law finding ch. 95.031 to be constitutional should have been given prospective effect only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenged the order of summary judgment for defendant pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2)(1983), a statute of repose that limited a product liability action to twelve years after the product was sold. Plaintiff was injured more than seven years after the statute had passed. The legislature subsequently amended ch. 95.031(2), repealing the statute of repose in product liability actions. Plaintiff argued that the repeal should have been applied retroactively. Before a statute of limitations could be applied retroactively, a clear manifestation of legislative intent that the statute be given retroactive effect had to exist. Because no such intent existed in the amendment, it could not be applied retroactively. While plaintiff's case was pending, the court receded from an earlier position and found ch. 95.031 constitutional as to causes of action accruing after the twelve-year statute of repose. Plaintiff argued that the decision should have been given prospective effect only. The court's decision was silent on the question of retroactivity, indicating intent to apply it retrospectively as well as prospectively. As such, summary judgment for defendant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court of appeal's order granting summary judgment to defendant in plaintiff's product liability action, holding that legislative amendment abolishing a statute of repose was prospective only because no clear manifestation of retroactive effect existed and that since case law was silent on the question of retroactively, it was to apply retrospectively as well as prospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the death sentence imposed upon him by the Circuit Court, Pinellas County (Florida) on resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court held appellant's counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the penalty phase of his trial. At the resentencing, the jury recommended the death penalty. The trial court imposed the death sentence, finding five aggravating factors and no mitigating factors. Appellant challenged that sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellee state did not engage in a pattern of systematically excluding African-Americans from the jury panel because it did not exclude the two African-American jurors solely based on their of race. Appellant could not relitigate the question of guilt and was not denied the chance to rebut the hearsay evidence admitted pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.141(1). The evidence presented properly was limited to evidence going to aggravating and mitigating factors. Statistical studies were insufficient to show unconstitutional discrimination in imposing the death penalty. The finding that appellant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons by setting fire to the victim's house could not establish an aggravating factor because only the victim was in the house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the death sentence imposed upon appellant on resentencing. Although the court erred in finding, as an aggravating factor, that appellant created a great risk of death to many people when he set fire to the victim's house, there were four valid aggravating factors and no mitigating factors to support the death penalty. Appellee state did not engage in racial discrimination when it chose the jury for the resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Florida Department of Revenue, challenged a judgment of the First District Court of Appeals (Florida) that declared invalid Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Florida Department of Revenue, sought review of a decision declaring invalid Fla. Stat. ch. 220.63. Appellee banks filed suit challenging the validity of the franchise tax imposed on banks and savings associations by the statute on the ground that it violated the Federal Public Debt Statute,&nbsp;31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124. The trial court upheld the statute and entered summary judgment against the banks. The court of appeals reversed and held the taxing statute invalid to the extent that it purported to include federal instrumentalities in its measure. The court noted that consistent with the legislative findings and declaration of intent contained in Fla. Laws ch. 72-278, Fla. Stat. ch. 220.63 was a classic nonproperty excise tax on the privilege of operating a bank or savings association within the state. As such, it was a franchise tax as contemplated by the exception numbered (a)(1) of 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124. Therefore the court found that the Florida franchise tax on banks and savings associations was nondiscriminatory and qualified as an exception to the exemption. The decision of the appeals court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals invalidating a portion of the state's franchise tax imposed on appellee banks and savings associations was reversed because the court found that the statute was a valid exercise of the state's authority to impose a tax on appellees for doing business in the state.</SPAN></P>

The state appealed the portion of the judgment that affirmed the trial court's suppression of seized contraband on the ground that the arresting officers failed to comply with knock and announce statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 901.19(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested as the result of information transmitted by an electronic eavesdropping device worn by a police undercover agent in defendant's home. After the information was transmitted to other officers who possessed an arrest warrant they entered defendant's home and arrested him. Defendant was charged with controlled substances offenses. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence of the transmitted conversation. The trial court granted the motion, but the court of appeal reversed, concluding that the transmission did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV and, thus, did not violate the conformity amendment to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The supreme court approved the court of appeal decision related to the transmission, but it quashed the portion of the decision that affirmed the trial court's suppression of seized contraband for failure to comply with the knock and announce statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 901.19(1). The supreme court determined that the undercover officer was lawfully inside defendant's apartment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer and respondent taxpayer filed suit challenging a tax assessment against their property. Petitioner's taxpayer suit was dismissed because petitioner taxpayer failed to pay his taxes before they became delinquent as provided in Fla. Stat. ch. 194.171(5) and (6). As to respondent taxpayer, the lower court held the requirement in section 194.171(5) and (6) was not a jurisdictional bar. On appeal, the supreme court held that the failure to pay taxes before they became delinquent while a suit was pending barred recovery under section 194.171(5) and (6). According to the supreme court, although section 194.171(5) and (6) appear to be somewhat harsh their meaning was clear. The supreme court held that section 194.171(5) plainly stated that a taxpayer could not maintain a suit contesting a tax assessment, and that such an action shall be dismissed, unless all taxes on the property assessed in years after the action was brought, which the taxpayer in good faith admitted to be owing, were paid before they become delinquent. The supreme court held that these requirements were jurisdictional and did not allow a court to retain jurisdiction once taxes become delinquent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the judgment dismissing petitioner's taxpayer suit and reversed the judgment allowing respondent's taxpayer suit to go forward because as a prerequisite to maintaining a tax assessment suit all taxes were to be paid before they became delinquent while the suit was pending.</SPAN></P>

He sought an extraordinary relief, writ of habeas corpus and stay of execution. In granting the writ, the court held that the &quot;mere presentation&quot; standard could no longer be considered controlling law. Under Hitchcock, the mere opportunity to present nonstatutory mitigating evidence did not meet constitutional requirements if the judge believed, or the jury was led to believe, that some of that evidence could not be weighed during the formulation of an advisory opinion or during sentencing. The factual situation presented by Hitchcock was also present in petitioner's case in substantially identical form, and the language was similar to the improper instruction given the jury in Hitchcock. Petitioner's jury was troubled by potential mitigating evidence, as reflected in a question asked of the judge regarding petitioner's firearms charge. The question showed that they considered that petitioner's accomplice could have been of equal or greater guilt. This, along with other mitigating evidence that was presented, precluded any finding of harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus and asserted that the advisory jury at his sentencing hearing was improperly restricted in the consideration of non-statutory mitigating factors. Petitioner was under sentence of death and execution warrant and had exhausted all of his appeals. The court noted that in several cases decided since petitioner's conviction, the court had held that the sentencer could not refuse to consider or be precluded from considering any relevant mitigating evidence and that an appellant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing if the record showed the sentencing judge had limited the mitigating circumstances to be considered. Further, the court held that if the jury's sentencing recommendation resulted from an unconstitutional procedure, the entire sentencing process was tainted. In petitioner's case, because the sentencing judge found two aggravating factors and only one statutory mitigating factor and refused to consider non-statutory mitigating circumstances, the court could not say the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court therefore vacated petitioner's sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, kidnapping with intent to commit sexual battery, sexual battery, and burglary and sentenced to death. Appellant sought review and alleged sixteen errors in the guilt and penalty phases of the trial. The court rejected almost all of appellant's allegations of error after concluding that each one was either without merit or constituted only harmless error. The one allegation that the court held had merit was that the trial judge erred in failing to certify appellant as a mentally disordered sex offender. The court found that under Fla. Stat. ch. 917.13(1), appellant was a mentally disordered sex offender and the trial court erred by refusing to so classify him. However, the court held the statute did not encompass first-degree murder because murder was not a sex offense per se.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, appellant communications companies challenged Public Service Commission (Florida) rulings that denied appellants' requests to abolish toll monopoly areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Restricted operating areas for local telephone companies were established to provide competitive interstate long distance telephone services. Case law affirmed the need for such service and, as a result, the state public service commission (commission) created toll monopoly areas (TMAs). Appellant communications companies challenged the creation of these TMAs as a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 364.335(4) because it was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers. The court affirmed the decision of the commission, stating that both Fla. Stat. ch.  364.335(4) and Fla. Stat. ch. 364.337 contained statutory authority for the commission to maintain the temporary TMAs and that the TMAs represented the commission's commitment to competition in long distance service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the administrative decision to create and maintain temporary monopolies for local telephone companies because the authority to maintain them was found in two different statutes and, although technological and other cost savings changes had not occurred as rapidly as predicted, that did not transform the temporary monopolies into a permanent fact of life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the circuit court reversed petitioner board's decision because the local antidiscrimination ordinance resulted in an unconstitutional restraint on respondent company's right to utilize its property as a retirement community, the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) denied petitioner's writ of certiorari because it found that the circuit court had correctly applied the law. Petitioner sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Characterizing its mobile home park as a retirement community, respondent company refused to allow a 29-year-old employed individual to move into the park. The individual filed a complaint with petitioner board, charging respondent with age discrimination in housing in violation of a local antidiscrimination ordinance. Petitioner adopted its executive director's recommendation to order respondent to allow complainant to move into the park and to pay damages for complainant's humiliation, embarrassment, and mental distress. The circuit court reversed because the ordinance did not allow for reasonable age restrictions. The appellate court denied petitioner's writ of certiorari, but certified an issue for review by the state supreme court. Although the ordinance's prohibition of reasonable age discrimination in housing was not an unconstitutional exercise of police power because its interference with otherwise protected rights bore a reasonable relationship to the elimination of invidious discrimination, the court held that the ordinance's authorization of common-law damages was an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers principles and the right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney and his client were Mississippi residents who contracted with respondent Delaware company to provide an expert witness for use in a medical malpractice suit.

Respondent filed a breach of contract action against petitioner and his client. Petitioner moved to quash service for a lack of personal jurisdiction, alleging that he did not do any of the acts specified in Florida's long-arm statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 48.193. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the motion, reasoning that the contract entered into between the parties provided the basis for personal jurisdiction. Petitioner sought further review. The court quashed and remanded the lower court's decision, holding that the parties' forum selection clause could not operate as the sole basis for Florida to exercise personal jurisdiction over the objecting nonresident petitioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy flew a helicopter over petitioner's property at approximately 400 feet. Through openings in a greenhouse roof, marijuana was viewed. A search warrant was obtained and several marijuana plants were found. Petitioner was charged with unlawful possession and manufacture of marijuana, under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13. The district court reversed an order to suppress evidence and certified a question for review. The question involved whether helicopter surveillance of the greenhouse constituted a &quot;search&quot; for which a warrant was required under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court held that the area was curtilage, and that under the Katz test, petitioner had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The court stated that there was a difference between a flying fixed-wing aircraft and a hovering helicopter. Furthermore, the governmental intrusion did not advance legitimate interests. Because petitioner's reasonable expectation of privacy was invaded and the observations constituted a search under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, the district court's decision was quashed and the case was remanded for reinstatement of the suppression order.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence, holding that appellant failed to demonstrate reversible error. The court held that although appellant's initial statement to police was obtained in violation of appellant's U.S. Const. amend. V rights, because it resulted from an unwarned custodial interrogation, two subsequent statements were properly admitted because a Miranda warning cured the procedural violation. Furthermore, the error was harmless because the properly admitted statements were cumulative. In addition, appellant's statements were voluntary, appellant had no U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel during the interrogation, and sufficient evidence supported the first degree murder conviction. Moreover, it was not error to exclude evidence of appellant's mental capacity, because in the absence of a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, testimony of appellant's mental state was inadmissible during the trial's guilt phase. Finally, although jury deliberation instructions were improper, the subsequent voir dire adequately ensured appellant's right to an impartial sentencing jury.</SPAN></P>

Defendant apparently discovered a small bag of cannabis at his workplace.

Defendant was charged with unlawfully introducing or possessing contraband upon the grounds of a state correctional institution in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.47(1)(a) and (c) (1983). During the charge conference, defendant's trial counsel requested a jury instruction on possession of less than 20 grams of cannabis, Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(f) (1983), as a lesser-included offense. The trial court denied the request, and the jury found defendant guilty. The court of appeal affirmed. Defendant filed an application for review. The court quashed the decision of the court of appeal and remanded for further proceedings, holding that possession of less than 20 grams of cannabis was a lesser-included offense because the information charged introduction or possession in the alternative.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. Appellant asserted that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, and in finding premeditation in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding no merit in appellant's guilt-phase assignments of error, the court affirmed the conviction; finding that the heightened level of premeditation required by Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(i) had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the court vacated the death sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court held that no instruction regarding the inapplicability of the felony-murder rule was required where it was clear from all the circumstances that no predicate felony was involved. The court held that appellant failed to object to the trial court's failure to give written instructions to the jury, and held that this was not fundamental error. Because the testimony indicated that appellant ordered the victim to his knees before stabbing him 17 times, the court held that sufficient premeditation existed to support the conviction. On the other hand, the court held that the evidence did not rise to the heightened level of premeditation required to support the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator of ch. 921.141(5)(i). Where this left but one aggravating factor, the court held that the death penalty was not indicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the first-degree murder conviction but vacated the death sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court found no merit in appellant's complaints regarding jury instructions, expert testimony, or the guilt-phase finding of premeditation. The court held, however, that the level of premeditation proved was insufficient to support the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that even tenured employees had no vested or contractual rights in the continuation of legislatively created employment once that employment was legislatively abolished, the court reversed the judgment to the extent that it declared 1985 Fla.

The court found that the legislature's intent was to create a highly qualified and responsive staff, and its means was increasing pay and benefits but requiring that employees serve at will. The court held that the objective was legitimate, and that the means bore a rational and reasonable relationship to that objective. The court also held that because the legislature created the employment enjoyed by members of appellee doctor's union, the legislature could take that employment away without affecting the rights of tenured employees in the employment. The court noted that appellee's members were also given the opportunity to remain in the career service in any position for which they were qualified, albeit not as physicians since those positions no longer existed in the career service.</SPAN></P>

Further, the legislature did not have sufficient authority to impair insurance contracts by changing the agreed-to premiums.

Respondent initiated a declaratory judgment action contending that the county ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers clause of the Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. The appellate court affirmed the decision, concluding that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it empowered the board to award damages for noneconomic injuries. The supreme court approved the decision because the board's power was an unconstitutional delegation of judicial authority. The ordinance authorized the board to exercise powers that were fundamentally judicial in nature.

Petitioners utilized the income test set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 196.1975(4) (1985) in denying the full exemption. The income test linked the extent of property tax exemption with the income of the home's residents. The court of appeal found that the income test was unconstitutional and certified as a question of great public importance whether the court's previous opinion finding the income test unconstitutional continued to have vitality and, if so, did the amended income test pass constitutional muster. Petitioners filed an application for review. The court affirmed and struck as unconstitutional paragraph (4) of Fla. Stat. ch. 196.1975, holding that the income test was too narrow in scope to conform to the tax limitation set forth in Fla. Const. art.

First, only one of those statements was objected to at trial and thus could be raised on appeal. Second, appellate counsel did present the argument as to that statement on appeal, but it was rejected. Thus, the court declined to address the issue again because it was already raised and ruled upon on appeal.

The district court had affirmed a judgment for respondent nonresidents in petitioner resident's tort action against them following an automobile accident in Florida. Although not required by Florida law to do so, respondent nonresident owner had obtained PIP coverage meeting the requirements of Florida's no-fault statute. Petitioner admitted to the trial court that she did not suffer threshold injuries but argued that she could maintain a tort action against respondents because the tort exemption in Fla. Stat. ch. 627.737 (1983) did not apply to nonresidents. The court agreed with the district court that the tort exemption applied not only to those individuals required by statute to provide PIP coverage but to every individual, resident or nonresident, who actually provided PIP coverage conforming to the no-fault law.

Requiring political committees to file a statement of organization, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 106.03 (Supp. 1984), was supported by the compelling state interest of informing the electorate of those involved in raising and spending money for elections. Chapter 106.03 was not vague or overbroad in light of Fla. Stat. ch. 106.011(1983)'s definition of a political committee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant tried to force himself on the 15-year-old victim, she kicked him in the groin. Defendant then strangled her and buried her under the house along with her pocketbook and some clothing to make it appear as if she had run away. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Defendant challenged his conviction on four grounds. The supreme court held that: (1) defendant's confession was properly admitted; (2) the trial court did not violate defendant's sixth amendment right to confront witnesses by allegedly limiting his cross-examination of two state's witnesses; (3) the trial court did not err in permitting the state to elicit certain testimony from a witness on redirect examination; and (4) death-qualified juries were constitutional. In addition, defendant's six claims of error in the penalty phase of the proceeding were without merit.</SPAN></P>

After the trial, petitioners filed motions for attorney fees in excess of those allowed under Fla. Stat. ch. 925.036 (1983).

The intermediate court affirmed the trial court's final order and petitioners sought review. The appellate court quashed the decision and remanded the case for a determination of reasonable fees. The court found that trial courts had the inherent power to allow, in extraordinary and unusual cases, departure from the statute's fee guidelines when necessary in order to ensure that an attorney who had served the public by defending an accused was not compensated in an amount which was insufficient given his or her time, energy, and talent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state requested the court to issue a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent, a circuit judge, from determining prior to trial the appropriateness of the death penalty in the event that defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. Petitioner also sought a writ of mandamus compelling respondent to excuse jurors who were unable to recommend a sentence of death. Petitioner argued that respondent had no authority to prejudge the death penalty's appropriateness because such a ruling unconstitutionally infringed on an executive function exclusively within a prosecutor's discretion. The court held that respondent had no authority to interfere with the prosecutor's discretion in proceeding as a death penalty case. The court reasoned that allowing respondent to make pre-trial determinations of the death penalty's applicability would effectively create a statutorily unauthorized trifurcated death sentence procedure. Based on this conclusion, the court granted the petition for writ of prohibition but withheld the formal issuance of the writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner state's request for a writ of prohibition preventing respondent circuit judge from determining prior to trial the appropriateness of the death penalty in the event of a conviction of first-degree murder. The court held that respondent lacked authority to decide before trial whether the death penalty would be imposed in a first-degree murder case.</SPAN></P>

Appellant state sought review. The court reversed and remanded. It found that Fla. Stat. ch. 732.9185 was constitutional because the record clearly established that the statute reasonably achieved the permissible legislative objective of providing sight to citizens. Furthermore, the court found that a person's constitutional rights terminated at death, that the next of kin did not have property rights in the remains of a decedent, and that the corneal tissue removal was not a taking of property.</SPAN></P>

The facts indicated that at the time the murder was committed, appellant was attempting to effectuate his premeditated design to kill police officers. Substantial evidence indicated that appellant formed a premeditated design to kill the victim. The trial court did not deny appellant a fair trial by denying his venue change request. The trial court did not have a great difficulty in impaneling a fair and impartial jury and appellant failed to raise a presumption of partiality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of sexual battery. The sole evidence offered by the state was the testimony of the victim. Petitioner tried to inquire into the victim's sexual relationship with her boyfriend. The trial court held that the questions were barred by Fla. Stat. ch. 794.022(2) (1983), and held that the statute did not deny petitioner his constitutional right to confrontation. Petitioner's requested jury instruction requiring rigid scrutiny of the victim's testimony was denied. The district court, on rehearing, vacated a decision requiring that the instruction be given and posed a certified question regarding whether the instruction was appropriate. The supreme court held that it was not and approved the district court's decision. The standard jury instruction was adequate, counsel had the opportunity to indicate that the case turned on the victim's testimony, and petitioner's constitutional rights were not abridged. The requested instruction was improper because it went to the weight of the evidence. A victim's sexual activity with others was not admissible unless relevant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Glades County (Florida) that convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder and imposed two death sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of two counts of first-degree murder and his two death sentences, asserting that errors occurred during the guilt phase of the trial. He argued that death-qualified juries were unconstitutional, that a juror was improperly excluded for cause, and that his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to confront witnesses was violated by improper restriction on the cross-examination of a witness, among other alleged errors. The supreme court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court reasserted its position that death-qualified juries were constitutional, noting that the proper standard for excluding jurors in death cases was the Adams test, which held that a juror could not be challenged for his views on capital punishment unless those views prevented or impaired his performance of duties as a juror under his instructions and oath. The supreme court held that the trial judge was in the best position to make the judgment and found no error. Further, the court found that cross-examination was not unduly restricted when the question posed might have been relevant, but its probative value was outweighed by the danger of misleading or confusing the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's first-degree murder convictions and death sentences. The trial court did not commit error in allowing a death-qualified jury or in excluding a juror for cause after determining that the juror's views would impair the performance of her duties. Nor did the trial court err by restricting cross examination when the question posed was potentially relevant but was likely to mislead the jury.</SPAN></P>

However, appellee decided to change the method of assessment and did so by adopting a new resolution. Appellant objected to the method of notification and claimed that it did not have an opportunity to present arguments to appellee. Appellee filed an action to have the bonds validated, and the trial court validated the bonds. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision and held that the procedural irregularities that occurred were not so substantial as to deny appellant due process. Further, the court held that Fla. Stat. Ch. 163 did not apply to the present case, and thus, the parties' arguments regarding this statute were inapplicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant agency's petition for permanent termination of appellee mother's parental rights under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.41(1)(f)1.d (1983) was granted based solely on appellee's failure to substantially comply with a performance agreement drafted by appellant. The appellate court reversed the termination order, finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.41(1)(f)1.d (1983) was unconstitutional. Appellant sought review. The court held that in order for appellee's parental rights to be permanently terminated, appellant had to show abandonment and abuse or neglect of the children by clear and convincing evidence. Because the statute allowed appellee's parental rights to be permanently terminated based solely on her failure to comply with a performance agreement, the statute unconstitutionally infringed on appellee's fundamental right to custody of her children. The court therefore affirmed the appellate court order reversing the termination of appellee's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant local exchange carriers (LEC) had a revenue-sharing agreement that was based in part on certain accounting expenses each incurred. Because another LEC, which was a party to the agreement, was also a regional Bell operating company, it had been required to divest certain assets to which the expenses related, and it petitioned the Florida Public Service Commission (commission) for a rate increase. The commission instead issued an order modifying the revenue-sharing agreement to permit this LEC to participate in the revenues as if it was still incurring the expenses. Holding that the commission lacked jurisdiction to modify the agreement, the court quashed the order and remanded. The court held that the presumption of regularity applicable upon review of commission orders did not apply to those orders that were beyond the commission's power. The court held that neither Fla. Stat. ch.  364.055 nor Fla. Stat. ch. 364.14 conferred authority on the commission to alter practices that did not affect ratepayers. The court also held that such unauthorized interference was an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorneys were appointed by the court pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 925.036 to represent an indigent defendant at trial and on appeal. Petitioners sought more than the amount allowed by Fla. Stat. ch. 925.036(2)(e) for attorney fees because an extraordinary amount of time was spent on the case. The court found that it was within the inherent power of Florida's trial courts to allow, in extraordinary and unusual cases, departure from the statute's fee guidelines when necessary in order to ensure that an attorney who has served the public by defending the accused was not compensated in an amount which was confiscator of his or her time, energy, and talents. In sum, the court found that find the statute delineating the amount of attorney fees for indigent criminal defendants was directory rather than mandatory. Although facially valid, the statute was unconstitutional as applied because it curtailed the inherent power of the court to ensure adequate representation of the criminally accused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee and her husband brought an action against appellant physician on theories of negligence and lack of informed consent after appellee wife suffered complications from a surgery appellant had performed.

The trial court had held for appellant physician but provided the jury with an improper instruction that suggested that a written consent was a valid consent. Appellees successfully challenged the trial court decision on appeal when appellant's application for state supreme court review was granted and ch. 768.46 was upheld as constitutional. The court found the appeals court had misread a crucial element of ch. 768.46(4)(a) that provided a consent which was evidenced in writing and met ch. 768.46(3) was presumed to be a valid consent, but remanded for a new trial on the issue of informed consent because the misleading jury instruction possibly affected the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for jogging topless on a public beach in violation of a regulation requiring proper bathing attire. The court of appeal upheld defendant's conviction and rejected her contention that the regulation in question, Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 16D-2.04(1)(e), was vague and overbroad. On further appeal, the state supreme court upheld the rulings of both lower courts. The court noted that defendant had no grounds to complain about any overbreadth in the regulation because public nudity was unprotected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Thus, it was entirely within the state's purview to prohibit total and partial public nudity. The court further held that the posted regulation's language, while perhaps not as precise as it could have been, was nonetheless sufficiently clear that a person of ordinary intelligence would understand what it prohibited. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss charges of unlawful possession of embossing machines on the ground that the statute criminalizing such possession was unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that the statute in question, Fla. Stat. ch. 817.63 (1983), was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and the trial court dismissed the charges. A state appellate court upheld that judgment. On further appeal, the state supreme court affirmed, albeit on different grounds. The court ruled that ch. 817.63 was not overbroad, inasmuch as free speech rights were not implicated; nor was it vague, inasmuch as a person of ordinary intelligence could discern what conduct the statute deemed criminal. However, the court held that ch. 817.63 violated substantive due process restrictions in that it criminalized mere possession of ordinary objects without any requirement that the object be possessed with criminal intent. As such, it unconstitutionally invaded the sphere of personal liberty.</SPAN></P>

The court found that no reversible error occurred based on defendant's absences during crucial stages of his trial because he either waived his absence or the alleged absence constituted harmless error. The court held that defendant's statements to officers were voluntary because defendant acknowledged and waived his right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present. With respect to a statement to an officer who transported him to jail, the court held that the trial court properly admitted this statement because defendant gave it spontaneously and not under interrogation by the officer. The court held that defendant's remaining points of error were without merit and affirmed his two death sentences. The court found no error in the fact that defendant's three accomplices were not sentenced to death because defendant's aggravating factors far outweighed his mitigating factors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the state department of insurance, sought review from a First District Court of Appeal (Florida) decision that found insurance anti-rebate statutes, Fla. Stat. chs. 626.611(11) and 626.9541(1)(h) (1983), were unconstitutional and an invalid exercise of the state's police power. The action was brought by appellees, a county consumer advocates office, challenging the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees filed a complaint alleging that the anti-rebate statutes, Fla. Stat. chs. 626.111(11) and 626.9541(1)(h) (1983), violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 by preventing price competition with respect to insurance agents' commissions. The trial court found that the challenged statutes were a valid exercise of state police power and entered summary judgment in favor of appellants. The district court reversed and held that there was no legitimate state interest to justify the continued existence of the anti-rebate statutes. The state supreme court affirmed the district court's decision and held that the anti-rebate statutes were void under the state constitution to the extent they prevented rebating any portion of an insurance agent's commission to insurance customers. The court held that that the legislation was not within the scope of state police power. There was no identifiable relationship between the anti-rebate statutes and a legitimate state purpose in safeguarding public health, safety, or general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the district court's decision, the state supreme court held that the anti-rebate statutes were unconstitutional because the legislation was not designed to promote public health, safety, or welfare and there was no relationship between the enactments and any legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner collaterally attacked via Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 a death sentence imposed by the trial court after a jury convicted him of committing first degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cable providers responded to tenant requests for cable television service. Appellee landlords refused to allow appellants to provide the service. Appellants alleged it had a right pursuant to Fla.

Stat. ch. 83.66, which prohibited landlords from denying cable television access to tenants and provided that no compensation would be paid to the landlord for such access, was unconstitutional. Fla. Stat. ch. 83.66 was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, because it required a taking of property without justification or due process of law. The supreme court determined that the statute allowed cable providers, under authorization from the state, to install equipment on property that was not held out for tenant use. The supreme court concluded that, essentially, a portion of the landlord's property would be taken.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctor argued that the two-year malpractice statute of limitations, Fla.

The jury instruction and verdict form on the statute of limitations were also properly presented to the jury. Petitioner doctor had withdrawn his defense of comparative negligence and, therefore, the lower court was correct in assessing the full measure of damages. The lower court was also correct in denying respondent attorney's fees because Fla. Stat. ch. 768.56 (1980) could not be applied to a cause of action accruing before its effective date. Petitioner hospital was correct in its assertions that the limitation of liability provisions of ch. 768.54 were constitutional and that portion of the decision was quashed, but the lower court properly concluded that the issue of negligence was a question for the jury. As to petitioner compensation fund, ch. 95.11(4)(b) precluded recovery in actions brought after the two-year statute of limitations period had expired, and the lower court's decision on that point was quashed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 163.353 provided general authority to taxing districts to appropriate funds to redevelopment trust funds and ch. 163.387 provided that no taxing authority was exempt from contributing to a redevelopment tax fund. Such statutes were constitutional, contrary to appellant's assertions. Tax increment revenues were based on the increase brought about by the increased value of redeveloped property, and the amount of the special taxing district's contribution would never exceed the amount of the increment. It was within the legislature's power to make community redevelopment one of the respective purposes of special taxing districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the lower court validating the issuance by appellee city of proposed redevelopment revenue bonds was affirmed because special taxing districts were allowed to contribute tax increment revenues for repayment of the bonds based on the increased value of property redeveloped through a redevelopment tax fund as one of the approved purposes of such districts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police established a roadblock for the admitted purpose of apprehending DUI drivers. The police blocked lanes to form a funnel, requiring all traffic to travel in one lane and to pass an officer stationed on the roadway. That officer had instructions to stop every fifth automobile during heavy traffic and every third automobile during light traffic. Respondent drove a car which the police diverted. After respondent failed several field sobriety tests, the police took him into custody. A decision reversing respondent's conviction for driving under the influence in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193 (1981) was affirmed. It was essential that a written set of uniform guidelines be issued before a roadblock can be utilized. Law enforcement officials had to conduct sobriety checkpoints so as to minimize the discretion of field officers. Roadblocks did not need to stop every car. Law enforcement officials had to keep the degree of intrusion upon motorists and the length of detention of each driver to a minimum. Petitioner failed to prove that the roadblock procedure met the balancing test and therefore it violated the requirements of U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that ch. 364.335(4) was not an unconstitutional grant of legislative authority to appellee, and the lack of standards or guidelines to govern such monopolies was of no moment given that the arrangement was anticipated as being temporary.

Appellant moved for postconviction relief, which the trial court denied under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Appellant challenged that order and requested a stay of execution. The court noted that in his order denying relief, the trial judge addressed the allegation that he failed to consider nonstatutory mitigating circumstances and expressly found that reasonable lawyers and judges at the time of appellant's trial could have mistakenly believed that nonstatutory mitigating circumstances could not be considered. In view of the trial judge's statement, and because appellant's presentation at his resentencing proceeding was improperly limited by the court's prior order, the court held that appellant's sentence was imposed in violation of United States Supreme Court precedent.

The second issue was whether petitioner committed an unfair labor practice during its negotiations with respondent union where respondent union declared an impasse during discussions about the subject of demotion and discharge grievance procedures. The supreme court approved the lower court's decision in part and quashed it in part. The supreme court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 474.401 (1981) was constitutional and that civil service ordinances did not affect the required bargaining powers. The statute did not threaten to undermine local civil service systems statewide because it was designed to co-exist with local civil service systems and was not intended to replace them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Leon County Circuit Court (Florida), which dismissed appellant's complaint that alleged irregularities in an election for the Florida House of Representatives. Appellant argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 102.166, 102.168 (1983), pertaining to election contests, vested jurisdiction in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lost an election for the Florida House of Representatives by 39 votes. Prior to dismissing his action for lack of jurisdiction, the trial court commented that the election had been &quot;botched,&quot; and was fraught with manifest election law irregularities. Holding that Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 2, conclusively established that each house of Florida's legislature was the sole judge of the qualifications, elections, and returns of its members, the court affirmed the judgment. The court observed that, consistent with the constitution, the House of Representatives, in its internal rule 5.5, provided a mechanism for contesting the election of its members. The court held that a proper respect of the constitutionally mandated separation of powers required it to honor the language of art. III, &sect; 2. The court also noted that the application of Fla. Stat. ch. 102.168 (1983) to a legislative election would actually permit a court to first evaluate the qualifications of and then unseat a member of the legislature, and created an impermissible risk of intrusion upon the constitutionally established legislative domain.</SPAN></P>

The court held that pursuant to the state constitution, the houses of the legislature were the sole judges of the qualifications, elections, and returns of their members, and to permit judicial inquiry into the election appellant had lost would unconstitutionally intrude on the legislature's domain and violate the principle of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner, the speaker of the house, in his capacity as a citizen and taxpayer, joined the petition. The court treated the petition as if it were brought solely by petitioner in his capacity as a citizen and a taxpayer in order to avoid issues of standing. The court refused to issue the writ of mandamus. CS/SB 848 came within the definition of an appropriations bill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) struck petitioner municipality's discriminatory ordinance that imposed beach access fees only on drivers, the Trial Court in and for St. Johns County (Florida) struck appellant municipalities' similar ordinance on the same grounds. Petitioner appealed, and the appellate court certified the trial court's judgment for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, the issue concerned the validity of beach &quot;user fees&quot; charged to drivers of motor vehicles for entry onto the Atlantic beaches within the jurisdictions of petitioner and appellant municipalities. In each case, the lower courts struck petitioner's and appellants' ordinances because the imposition of such access fees discriminated against persons who drove, rather than walked, to the beach. Upon consolidation, the court quashed and reversed the lower courts' opinions because no constitutional provision, including the public trust doctrine, impeded the imposition of reasonable user fees for access to sovereign lands when the revenue received was used solely for the maintenance, operation, and improvement of those lands. Moreover, Fla. Stat. ch. 161.58(2) (1985) resolved the issue by allowing local governments to authorize, by a three-fifths vote, vehicular traffic on public beaches if the revenues were used only for beach maintenance purposes. Finally, reasonable access fees were permissible classifications. Thus, the court remanded to determine if the beach access fees were reasonable and if the ordinances otherwise complied with ch. 161.58.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After consolidating two cases, the court quashed the appellate court's striking of petitioner's ordinance that imposed public beach access fees upon drivers. Likewise, the court reversed the trial court's striking of appellants' similar ordinance. The court remanded both cases with directions to decide whether the fees were reasonable and whether they met the requirements of a newly enacted statute that allowed such fees under certain conditions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of felony murder conviction and sentence to death. Appellant argued the trial court erred in allowing testimony that he was a homosexual who had a relationship with the victim. The court held the fact that appellant knew the victim and had argued with him was relevant to prove motive, and the probative value outweighed any potential prejudicial impact. Appellant argued that his death sentence was unconstitutionally founded upon an improper doubling of the aggravating circumstances of creating a great risk of death to many persons and committing the capital felony while engaged in the commission of an arson. The court rejected that argument, concluding although arson may involve a great risk of death to many persons, this aggravating factor was dependent upon proof adduced at trial and was not necessarily encompassed by the felony of arson. The court held that the jury should have been properly instructed to consider the specific mitigating factor of mental disturbance. The issue had been preserved when the contemporaneous objection rule was satisfied-- there was a request for an instruction, the trial court understood and denied the specific request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction of guilt for first-degree felony murder. Because the jury should have been properly instructed on mitigating factor of extreme mental or emotional distress, the court vacated the death sentence and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, however, imposed two death sentences. Following appeals, remands, and resentencing, the governor signed appellant's death warrant. Appellant then filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. The court affirmed on appeal, finding that, because the motion conclusively showed appellant was not entitled to relief, the trial court did not err in denying the motion without a hearing. Appellant claimed, inter alia, that he had received ineffective assistance from trial and resentencing counsel because they failed to develop and present mitigating evidence regarding his long history of juvenile delinquency and drug abuse. The court held that, on its face, this claim failed to meet even the first part of the Strickland test and therefore showed no grounds for relief. The court further held that the remainder of appellant's points were not cognizable on collateral attack. The court denied appellant's application for stay of execution.</SPAN></P>

The court recognized that retroactive application of ch. 947.16(3) to a crime occurring before its effective date was an impermissible ex post facto law. However, the court held that the lower court erred in remanding for an evidentiary hearing to determine if the crime was committed prior to the effective date of ch. 947.16(3) because the trial court had already found that the conviction was entered prior to the statute's effective date. Because respondent received ineffective assistance of counsel, the court allowed him to raise the constitutionality of ch. 947.16(3) on appeal despite the fact that his counsel did not object to the application of ch. 947.16(3) at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by petitioners seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against subpoenas duces tecum issued by respondents, Florida Department of Business Regulation and Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering, petitioners appealed decision permitting subpoenas. Respondents sought banking records of petitioners' bank accounts, giving no notice to petitioners and asking banks not to inform petitioners of their investigation. Petitioners alleged the subpoenas were invalid, they violated petitioners' constitutional right to privacy and due process, and maintenance of public records constituted an additional violation of their constitutional right to privacy. The court held that much of the responsibility of formulating privacy interests was given by the U.S. Supreme Court to the individual states. The right to personal privacy in Florida, under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, was broader in scope than the federal Constitution. However, there was no complete immunity from governmental regulation and the right to privacy yielded to compelling governmental interests. The state's interest in conducting effective investigations in the pari-mutuel industry was a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied petitioner's motion to dismiss, ruling that his pouch was not &quot;securely encased&quot; within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(16) (Supp.1982). On appeal, petitioner claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion and that Fla. Stat. ch. 790.01(2) (1981), as refined in Fla. Stat. chs. 790.25(5) and 790.001(15), was unconstitutional. The court explained that a statute was constitutional if it bore a reasonable relation to a permissible legislative objective and was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or capricious. The court explained that promoting firearms safety and crime prevention were permissible legislative objectives and that the prohibition against carrying a concealed weapon was reasonably related to those objectives. Further, the statutes were not void for vagueness. However, the court determined that petitioner's motion to dismiss should have been granted. Under the facts of the case, the court held that petitioner's pouch was a zippered gun case, and therefore his carrying of it in his automobile was not in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

On rehearing, the court certified to the supreme court a conflict with a decision in another district as to whether the stacking amendment could be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner issued two automobile insurance liability contracts to the adult respondents. Both policies prohibited the stacking of the uninsured motorist coverage in said policies. While the policies were in effect, and nine days after an amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 627.4132 (Supp. 1980), effective October 1, 1980 went into effect permitting an insured to stack uninsured motorist coverage, adult respondents' two children were struck by a tortfeasor's automobile. One child was killed and the other seriously injured. The tortfeasor had limited liability coverage in an amount lower than adult respondents' uninsured motorist coverage. Respondents brought a declaratory judgment action in which they sought to invoke the statute's provisions permitting an insured to stack uninsured motorist coverage. The trial court granted summary judgment in respondents' favor on that issue and the district court affirmed the decision but the supreme court reversed, holding that to apply the statute permitting stacking to policies containing anti-stacking provisions and in effect at the time at issue would violate the Florida constitutional provision prohibiting the impairment of contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction and sentences from the Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County (Florida) for one count each of first-degree murder, robbery with a firearm, and armed burglary with an assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Brother-in-law contacted appellant and hired him to murder victim. The motive for the murder was both personal antipathy and a desire to obtain control of the victim's estate. Appellant recounted details of the crimes and the scheme to a wired informer. Police found evidence corroborating appellant's trips and statements he had made on the tapes. Appellant's conviction and sentences for first-degree murder, robbery with a firearm, and armed burglary with an assault were affirmed. The state's interests were not served by excluding relevant evidence which was lawfully obtained in another state. Appellant had known for months that the state had two tapes purporting to contain inculpatory statements that he had made. The jury was capable of determining whether the voice on the tapes was the same. Nothing in the state's chief examiner's direct testimony offered an opening for the cross examination which appellant sought. Aggravating factors were not based on the same essential feature of the crime or of the offender's character. Nothing in the record warranted finding any truly mitigating significance in appellant's age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentences because: 1) evidence was properly admitted; 2) the jury was properly instructed; 3) cross-examination was properly limited; and 4) the aggravating factors so clearly and convincingly outweighed the mitigating factors that no reasonable person could differ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised 31 claims on an appeal regarding his convictions and sentences for first-degree murder, robbery, and kidnapping. The court reviewed all of them, but discussed only a few. The exclusion of two jurors was not an error, as their unequivocal opposition to the death penalty would not permit them to apply the law or view the facts impartially. Sufficient evidence supported a finding that defendant's confession was freely and voluntarily made. The trial court appropriately limited counsel's closing argument to exclude the claim that defendant would have had to personally kill the victim to be guilty of first-degree murder, because this was felony murder, where that was not so. A response to the jury about the reporting of a split decision during the penalty phase was properly given. When defense counsel argued that defendant was young and his participation in the crime was minor, the trial court properly left entirely to the jury to assign whatever weight it wished to defendant's age and character. The evidence supported the trial court's finding of the aggravating circumstance that the crime was heinous, atrocious, and cruel. The convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for first-degree murder, robbery, and kidnapping and the sentences for them, because the record showed no error in support of his claims.</SPAN></P>

The court quashed reversal of convictions because there was sufficient evidence to support the incidental burden on speech imposed by a valid exercise of petitioner's police power. The court remanded for a new sentencing of petitioner bar manager because nothing, other than the trial, distinguished her from others convicted under the ordinance, and the court found as a matter of law that she could not be sentenced any more harshly than they.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mortgagee applied for review of the decision of the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida), which reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that respondent's deed and petitioner's mortgage should be cancelled because there was no valid consideration for the deed. The district court certified a question for review regarding what the proper scope of review for district courts of appeal in granting rehearings en banc was.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grantor, an elderly lady, transferred title to her home to an unrelated grantee by a quitclaim deed, which showed on its face that the consideration was &quot;love and affection.&quot; The grantee sold the property and those buyers mortgaged the property to petitioner mortgagee. Respondent, the personal representative of the grantor's estate, brought this action seeking cancellation of the deeds and mortgage. This court held that the deed was valid and effective to pass legal title although there was no valuable consideration paid and the grantor and grantee were not related. The constitutional law of homestead protection had been changed to eliminate the requirement of a valuable consideration as a condition of a conveyance of homestead property; therefore, there was no such limitation on the right to alienate by gift real property in general. On the certified question of the proper scope of review for district courts in granting rehearings en banc, the court held that the district courts were not limited by the case-law standards applied in the exercise of this court's discretionary conflict jurisdiction, but were free to develop their own concepts of decisional uniformity.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sued the manufacturer more than 12 years from the date of delivery of the machine to the original purchaser, but within the applicable four-year statute of limitations. The trial court granted summary judgment against petitioner on grounds that his action was barred by Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1979), a statute of repose. The appellate court affirmed, and certified the question as to whether that statute denied equal protection of the laws to persons who were injured by products delivered to the original purchaser between eight and 12 years prior to the injury. The court receded from its own prior decision and held that &sect; 95.031(2) did not violate equal protection. Instead, the court noted that the legislature in enacting that statute reasonably decided that perpetual liability placed an undue burden on manufacturers, and that 12 years from the date of sale was a reasonable time for exposure to liability for manufacturing a product. As such, the court held that the classification originally established by the statute bore a reasonable relationship to a proper state objective. The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the state department of transportation, exercised eminent domain and took portions of petitioners' land adjacent to a lake.

Petitioners sought review and the appellate court affirmed and certified the question regarding the riparian rights to the state supreme court. Upon review, the court concluded that the act of condemning petitioners' lands without compensating them for their riparian property rights was an unconstitutional taking. The court held that riparian rights were property rights that could be separated from the upland by bilateral agreement in a deed of conveyance. The court held that all or any interest in riparian rights could be transferred by voluntary act of the upland owner but that riparian rights could not be severed by condemnation proceedings without the consent of the upland owner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to compel plaintiff newspaper to pay sales taxes for the cost of printing. Plaintiff was a not-for-profit corporation that distributed free newspapers. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The intermediate appellate court certified the question of whether Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.08, which required taxation of all publications that were not sold but given away, was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff college newspaper. The court found that Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.08 was void as an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority insofar as it denied exemption from taxation to a free distribution newspaper. Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 212.005 (1983) allowed the state to tax each transaction that involved tangible personal property. The statutory scheme provided that newspapers were exempt from sales tax, thus because plaintiff failed to meet the administrative definition of newspaper, it was not exempt. The court held that imposition of the taxes provided an outcome inconsistent with the legislative intent. Because the primary purpose of the paper was to disseminate news, the court found plaintiff was exempt.</SPAN></P>

Prisoner contended that it was reversible error for the trial court to have denied the proffered witness an opportunity to testify. The court held that the trial court erred when it failed to exercise its discretion to have determined whether exclusion was warranted under the circumstances, and, instead, applied the sequestration rule as a strict rule of law. However, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the excluded evidence would not have affected the verdict. Prisoner argued that the trial court committed reversible error when it allowed the jury to have considered evidence of a prior crime committed by prisoner. The court held that the evidence that prisoner had previously burglarized the victim's house and, in so doing, had utilized the identical point of entry used on the date of the victim's murder, was, under the Williams rule, legally relevant to show identity and to show that prisoner knew that point of entry was available.

Appellant claimed that the statute under which appellee was created, Fla. Stat. ch. 190 (1984) was unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. Amend. XIV because Fla. Stat. ch. 109.006(2) (1984), provided for the election of the board of supervisors of a community development district by district landowners on a one-vote-per-acre basis rather than on a one-person, one-vote basis. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of validation, because appellee development district was not validly created. The court held that the statutory requirement concerning economic impact statements must be fully complied with in order to create a valid district. The court rejected appellant's contention that ch. 190 was unconstitutional, holding that the special development districts were not subject to the one-person, one-vote requirement because they do not exercise general governmental functions, and have a disproportionate impact on landowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of one count of first-degree murder, and jury recommended a life sentence. The trial court, however, concluded that aggravating factors existed and, therefore, imposed a sentence of death. Appellant argued that the victim's stepfather was improperly permitted to testify as to the deceased's identity. The court agreed with appellant but found that because appellant had failed to make a contemporaneous specific objection to the testimony, the matter was not preserved for appellate review. The court affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence, holding that the facts did not support finding an aggravating factor. The trial court also erred in finding that a prior conviction of a violent felony was more of an aggravating than a negative factor. The finding suffered from two defects: the information regarding appellant's prior conviction for breaking and entering came solely from a presentence investigation, and the state did not prove this factor beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the court concluded that a conviction of breaking and entering did not, on its face, prove a prior conviction of a violent felony.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 768.54(2)(b), 768.54(3)(e)3, and 768.51(1981), which related to hospital liability limitation and the method to be used by appellant fund in paying final judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court affirmed a $ 12.47 million medical malpractice verdict and held unconstitutional Fla. Stat. ch. 768.54(2)(b), 768.54(3)(e)3, and 768.51. On appeal, at issue was whether the statutory scheme providing for appellant fund to pay judgments for health care providers and physicians was constitutional under ch. 768.54(2)(b), 768.51, and 768.54(3)(e)3, either as enacted in 1976 or as amended in 1982. Appellant fund contended that an appellate court must apply the most recent version of the statute when it is the law in effect at the time of the appellate court's final decision. The court agreed, finding that the 1982 amendment to ch. 768.54 was remedial in nature. The court found nothing in the transfer of liability provision or the periodic pay-out provisions as applied to the case that invalidated the statutory scheme. Appellants further contended that it constituted prejudicial error for the trial court to admit into evidence an article utilized as part of the training materials for intensive care unit nurses. The court found the article irrelevant, and thus inadmissible. The admission was not harmless error. The court vacated the judgment and granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), of first-degree murder and other offenses in which the lower court imposed a sentence of death, appellant's convictions having been entered pursuant to pleas of guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant's convictions of first-degree murder and other offenses entered pursuant to appellant's pleas of guilty, the trial court imposed a sentence of death. On appeal, appellant contended that the evidence before the court at the hearing on appellant's plea was such as should have raised a question as to appellant's competency to enter pleas of guilty. The court found appellant's despondency and his ambivalence about his plea did not constitute reasonable grounds to believe he might be incompetent. The mere suggestion of the possibility that the accused was contemplating suicide did not as a matter of law raise a sufficient reasonable ground to believe he was incompetent. The court found no error in the fact that the trial court did not conduct a competency hearing on its own motion. Turning to the sentence of death, the court found merit in the argument that the sentence of death was tainted by the consideration by judge and jury of improper aggravating circumstances. The trial judge went beyond the proper use of statutory aggravating circumstances in his sentencing findings and the sentence of death could not stand. Appellant was entitled to a new sentencing trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for first-degree murder and the other crimes. The court reversed the sentence of death and remanded the case for a new sentencing proceeding before a jury empanelled for that purpose because the jury heard evidence and argument that did not properly relate to any statutory aggravating circumstance, thus the jury recommendation was tainted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.15 (3)(b)3.d, which permitted social security recipients between the ages of 65 and 70 to receive full benefits provided the recipient's earned income did not reach a maximum level, violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution by conflicting with 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 403 (f)(3). The trial court held in favor of respondents, finding that &sect; 440.15 (3)(b) 3.d was not unconstitutional, and petitioner appealed. The court ruled that &sect; 440.15 (3)(b)3.d. did not deny access to the courts or unconstitutionally discriminate on the basis of age. Further, the court held that &sect; 440.15 (3)(b)3.d. was rationally related to the legitimate state objectives of reducing fringe benefits to reflect productivity declines associated with age, inducing older workers to retire and thereby allow younger workers to advance, and reducing workers' compensation premiums. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the valid purposes of &sect; 440.15 (3)(b)3.d. did not conflict with the salutary purposes underlying &sect; 403 (f)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was the prevailing party in a medical malpractice action and appellant fund was responsible for payment of the portion of the judgment that exceeded the primary coverage. The trial court found Fla. Stat. ch. 768.56 (1981), providing for the payment of attorney fees in medical malpractice, constitutional, but expressed concern as to the computation of the fees. The court affirmed and adopted the federal lodestar approach for computing reasonable attorney fees. Requiring an unsuccessful litigant to pay the prevailing party's attorney fees did not constitute a penalty offensive to the system of justice. The award of attorney fees to the prevailing party was a matter of substantive law properly under the aegis of the legislature. The attorney fee applicant was to present adequate records detailing the work performed. In determining a reasonable hourly rate the court was to take into account certain factors in Fla. Bar. Code Prof. Resp. DR 2-106. The number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate produced the lodestar, to which a contingency risk multiplier ranging from 1.5 to 3 could be added or subtracted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a minor and her parents, sought review of a judgment of the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida), which held that it was precluded from issuing a writ of mandamus challenging the constitutionality of legislation providing that respondent county compensate petitioners for the unpaid balance awarded them in a personal injury action against respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court observed that the trial court ruling, barring it from issuing a writ of mandamus challenging the constitutionality of legislation, conflicted with a ruling in a separate case. In response, the court ruled that Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(b)(3) permitted the trial court to issue writs of mandamus so as to address the merits of a controversy. The court then noted that respondent county, pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 768.28(5), an immunity statute, paid petitioners, a minor and her parents, only a portion of a negligence judgment awarded to them, the cap permitted, and thereafter challenged the constitutionality of enacted legislation--Fla. Stat. ch. 83-393--directing the payment of the unpaid balance. Holding the act to be constitutional, the court said that waiver of sovereign immunity could only be dealt with by general law of the state legislature and that respondent could not provide for waiver of its sovereign immunity in its home rule charter. Sovereign immunity must be applied uniformly to all governmental entities. Furthermore, respondent could not invoke the cap and then ignore the statutory proviso authorizing recovery of amounts over the cap, when legislated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. In so doing, the court held that a law enforcement officer must have the discretion to enforce the law without being subject to tort liability for injuries to innocent third parties. On appeal, the issue was whether a law enforcement officer's discretionary police authority to make or not make an arrest constituted a basic judgmental or decision making function that was immune from tort liability. The court found that the decision of whether to enforce the law by making an arrest was a basic judgmental or discretionary governmental function that was immune from suit, and approved the decision of the lower court dismissing the complaint. The court reasoned that the decision was a basic discretionary, judgmental decision that was inherent in enforcing the laws of the state.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, dismissal of the indictment was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court held that ch. 839.25(1)(a), which defined official misconduct as knowingly refraining, or causing another to refrain from performing a duty imposed upon him by law, impermissibly allowed the imposition of criminal sanctions for the failure to perform duties imposed by statutes, rules, or regulations that may themselves impose either a lesser penalty or no penalty at all. The court further held that because agency rules had the effect of law, any violation of any agency rule could be grounds for imposition of criminal sanctions under ch. 839.25(1)(a).

The court restated the certified question as whether a governmental entity may be liable in tort to individual property owners for the negligent actions of its building inspectors in enforcing provisions of a building code enacted pursuant to police power vested in that governmental entity. The court went through a thorough evaluation of governmental liability, specifically focusing on discretionary acts, and held that governments had to be free to enact and enforce laws without creating new duties and corresponding liabilities. The court further held that the government had no responsibility to protect personal property interests or ensure the quality of buildings that individuals erect or purchase. The court found that the proper remedy for faulty construction lay in an action against the contractor, developer, or seller.

State, 436 So.2d 1047 (Fla. 1st DCA 1983), upon which the district court had relied in its ruling, and which held that the fact that the challenged juror was employed in the same position as the victim of the crime created both an appearance and a substantial probability of inherent juror bias. The court held that the test for determining juror competency was whether the juror could lay aside any bias or prejudice and render his verdict solely upon the evidence presented and the instructions on the law given to him by the court.

The commissioner also found that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.15 precluded recovery of wage loss benefits because petitioner was over age 65 and was eligible to receive social security benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. In defendant's motion to vacate his sentence and conviction, he argued that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and that the trial court erred in denying his motion without an evidentiary hearing. The court determined that the witnesses' testimony that counsel failed to present was clearly to defendant's disadvantage. Similarly, the court found that the psychological evidence that counsel did not present as mitigating factors during the penalty phase was inconsistent with the theory of defense. The court thought that the trial court properly disposed of defendant's motion to vacate without an evidentiary hearing. In defendant's habeas petition, he argued that he was denied the right to a direct appeal due to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. For each item that defendant raised, the court concluded that he either failed to demonstrate prejudice or to demonstrate that appellate counsel's performance was deficient. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed, and the petitions for a writ of habeas corpus and a stay of execution were denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that denied defendant state prisoner's motion to vacate his first-degree murder conviction and death sentence was affirmed. The court denied defendant's petitions for a writ of habeas corpus and a stay of execution. In deciding the appeal of the motion to vacate and the petition for habeas corpus, the court rejected defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>

The lower court dismissed the charges against respondents on the ground that the state statute under which they were charged was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Magnuson Fishery and Conservation Management Act (Act), 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1801 (1976). The court reversed and remanded and found that there was nothing in the Act that curtailed the state's extraterritorial jurisdiction over its registered vessels. The court further found that because the state statute under which respondents were charged did not conflict with any existing federal regulation, the state was not precluded from enforcing its penal statute relative to the taking or possession of small shrimp or prawn within or without the waters of the state. Finally, the court found that the Act made no attempt to preempt the field, but, in fact, recognized continued state jurisdiction over vessels registered under the laws of the various states.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant personal representative challenged a decision from the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida), which reversed the trial court and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 665.063(1)(a) (1981), was unconstitutional under the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The personal representative and appellee sisters, all daughters of the decedent, disputed the personal representative's right to savings account funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had joint accounts, with the personal representative as survivor, but the funds were excluded from the estate's inventories. The sisters objected, contending that the personal representative could not get the money because the account was only in case the decedent needed help. The trial court held that the state bank funds were estate assets, finding that the decedent's intent was to facilitate dispersal, but intent was immaterial to the federal savings funds because, absent fraud or undue influence, title vested in the survivor, and it found the statutes constitutional. However, the appellate court determined that the sisters were testamentary beneficiaries and received disparate treatment based on the asset's location, finding ch. 665.063(1)(a) unconstitutional. On review, the court asserted that vesting applied, in the absence of fraud, to joint accounts at federal associations and that the sisters were not testamentary beneficiaries. The court found it reasonable to treat accounts governed by the Florida Savings Association Act differently from those governed by the Florida Banking Code and that ch. 665.063(1)(a) was constitutional, reversing the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the challenged statute was constitutional and reversed the district court's decision holding it invalid. The court held that the conclusive presumption applied to all monies deposited in the savings and loan joint account and that the personal representative was entitled to those assets.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner hotel owners challenged the validity of a state law and municipal ordinance providing for the imposition and assessment of a &quot;bed tax&quot; in respondent county. Petitioners contended the state law failed to publish independent tax collection mechanisms and violated equal protection guarantees. Upholding the lower appellate court's finding that the law was valid, the court approved of reasoning that an analogous section of state law provided for collection of the tax. The court also noted that the state legislature corrected any ambiguity regarding collection of the tax subsequent to commencement of the case by explicitly including collection and distribution procedures. Additionally, the court rejected the due process and equal protection challenges to the state law, reasoning that language identical to that in the statute at issue had been declared constitutionally valid in an analogous case. The court also upheld the lower appellate court's decision invalidating the municipal collection ordinance because it purported to authorize collection of the tax by respondent county's tax collector.</SPAN></P>

Three cases were consolidated for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding Fla. Stat. ch. 817.563 was unconstitutional was reversed. In reversing the lower court's judgment, the supreme court held that the statute was not vague and that it served a legitimate government purpose. According to the supreme court, when interpreting a statute established principles of statutory construction must be utilized. The supreme court determined that the legislative intent behind section 817.563 was not to create a fraud statute. The supreme court held that section 817.563 was not designed to protect illegal drug users and dealers from fraudulent representations by other dealers. The supreme court then held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, as it required a general intent and not specific intent. Next, the supreme court held that in the absence of an impingement upon constitutional rights, an act of the legislature was presumed to be constitutional. The supreme court held that the burden was on the challenger to demonstrate that the law did not bear a reasonable relationship to a proper state objective.

Stat. ch. 570.15 violated U.S. Const. amend. IV because it allowed administrative searches without a showing of probable cause and without an administrative plan that contained specific neutral criteria. The court noted that a United States district court decision had held that the statute was unconstitutional because, once a legitimate stop occurred, the decision to inspect further had to have been supported by probable cause based on reasonable standards or neutral criteria. The court stated that the statute authorized searches based on an administrative plan that contained specific neutral criteria.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, race track permit holders who conducted horse racing at various state tracks, filed a complaint against appellants, state agencies, seeking to declare as unconstitutional provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 550 that prohibited horse racing and pari-mutuel gambling on Sunday. Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted on the basis that the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 550 banning pari-mutuel wagering on Sundays was unconstitutional. Appellants sought review of the adverse decision, which was certified for review. The court reversed judgment of the trial court for appellants and held that the Sunday closing law for sporting activities involving pari-mutuel wagering did not constitute unlawful discrimination because it was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of regulating and controlling gambling. The court held that pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV, states were granted broad police powers to enact laws rationally related to achievement of the state's objective. Further, the court held that the Sunday closing law did not unlawfully discriminate against appellees, because the law treated all pari-mutuel facilities similarly circumstanced.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, petitioner argued that the district court should have declared the statute invalid because it failed to describe with sufficient particularity what a person had to do in order to satisfy the statute and avoid arrest. The court affirmed petitioner's conviction and held that the statute was constitutionally valid. The court reasoned that petitioner's reliance on a similar statute from another state which was found unconstitutional was improper because different elements were considered under that statute.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that the Division properly exercised its discretion to deny the transfer. On appeal, the court agreed that Fla.

The court reasoned that the statute permitted the state to deny the transfer of a liquor license when the licensee had been charged with violation of the beverage laws, and approved the decision of the district court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant guilty of three counts of first-degree murder based upon the deaths of three hitchhikers. It recommended that appellant be sentenced to death, which the trial judge adopted. The trial judge found three aggravating circumstances and no evidence of any statutory mitigating circumstances. He found that the nonstatutory mitigating circumstances were of little if any weight. Appellant sought review. The court reviewed the record and considered each contention, but found no reversible error. There was sufficient evidence to support the finding that appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to have counsel present when he made certain statements to law enforcement. Although the testimony concerning appellant's admission to being wanted in other states bore no relevance to any material fact at issue and the motion to exclude all such references should have been granted, the error was harmless. There was no error in allowing the photographs of the victims into evidence. The trial court properly found that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances found. Thus, the lower court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a trial court decision that, after a jury trial, convicted him of first-degree murder and attempted robbery and sentenced him to death. The state supreme court affirmed appellant's conviction but remanded for resentencing upon consideration of the one valid aggravating circumstance and any existing mitigating circumstances. Appellant's conviction was supported by sufficient evidence. Moreover, no reversible procedural or evidentiary errors occurred. Furthermore, custodial statements appellant made and physical evidence seized pursuant to a consent to search were admissible because they were not the fruit of an illegal arrest. The exigency rule was applicable as the police reasonably believed an emergency existed. Evidence of appellant's prior nonviolent felony convictions was properly admitted after appellant became a witness to illuminate the quality of his testimony. Appellant was entitled to resentencing after the appellate court found that only one valid aggravating circumstance was present in the instant case rather than the multiple aggravating circumstances found by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

After exhausting the appellate process, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the federal district court. Because he raised a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, the federal court abated the proceedings until the state supreme court could rule on his petition. The supreme court found that the majority of the omissions alleged by petitioner related to matters which his counsel was procedurally precluded from raising on appeal. The counsel could not be considered incompetent or ineffective for failing to raise issues that he was procedurally barred from raising because they were not properly presented at trial. Moreover, none of the alleged omissions constituted fundamental error that could be raised on direct appeal without their having been raised in the trial court. The supreme court denied habeas relief because petitioner failed to demonstrate that his appellate counsel's performance fell short of prevailing professional norms or was substantially deficient under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motions to vacate and to stay execution, and affirmed the trial court's orders while denying defendant's motion for stay of execution. The supreme court determined that defendant did not prove that he received less than professionally competent assistance of counsel or that he was prejudiced due to his counsel's performance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed for a writ of extraordinary relief and for a stay of execution, arguing that he was incompetent to be executed. Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder in 1974 and sentenced to death. During the pendency of a prior postconviction relief proceeding under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, the Governor of Florida invoked Fla. Stat. ch. 922.07 (1979) and directed that petitioner be examined by psychiatrists to determine his competency to be executed; however, at that time, petitioner refused to cooperate or be examined. Upon review, the state's highest court rejected petitioner's contention that Fla. Stat. ch. 922.07 (l979) was unconstitutional because due process was not provided through a judicial determination of competency in an adversary proceeding. The court also rejected defendant's argument that a prior adjudication in Michigan finding defendant not guilty by reason of insanity controlled the issue of his competency merely because there had been no subsequent judicial restoration of sanity. The court denied the petition for writ of extraordinary relief and for stay of execution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner a writ of extraordinary relief or a stay of execution, holding that a Florida statute permitting petitioner to be examined for competency to be executed did not deny petitioner due process of law and that petitioner was not entitled to a judicial determination of competency to be executed at an adversarial proceeding.</SPAN></P>

In sentencing appellant to death on each murder, the court found three aggravating circumstances: previous convictions of six first-degree murders; heinous, atrocious, or cruel murders; and murders committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner. The supreme court affirmed the adjudications and held that the trial court had properly imposed the death sentence. The court explained there was a competent basis for the court's acceptance of appellant's pleas and adjudication. The large number of prior murder convictions was the dominant factor. The trial court did not err in finding that the murders were heinous, atrocious or cruel and committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner. The court also held that the trial court had not erred in denying appellant's motion to preclude the death penalty. Sentencing appellant to death for these last two murders was not disproportionate. Comparing these cases to other death sentence cases, the court found appellant's sentences to be both proportionate and warranted.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 3.850.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to death and life imprisonment. On direct appeal, the court affirmed the convictions but remanded for resentencing because the trial judge considered a nonstatutory aggravating factor. Appellant's sentence to death was affirmed. Certiorari was denied and appellant brought a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The court rejected appellant's arguments and affirmed the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief. The court found that appellant's sentence of death was based on a voluntary and valid guilty plea. The court noted that the record demonstrated that his guilty plea was intelligent and fully understood. The court also concluded that he was not denied effective assistance of counsel during the course of the penalty trial. The court reasoned that he could not show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Maternal and paternal grandparents battled over custody to their orphaned granddaughter.

After appellant was appointed attorney-ad-litem for the child, he requested that the trial court close the adoption proceedings pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 63.162(1) (1983). The trial court denied the motion, holding that ch. 63.162(1) was unconstitutionally overbroad because it permitted no discretion in weighing the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial against the media's right under U.S. Const. amend. I of access to court proceedings On direct review, the court reversed the order of the trial court and held that ch. 63.162(1) was constitutional. According to the court, the Florida legislature had recognized an overriding public policy of protecting from harmful publicity parties to and the subject to adoption proceedings. The court found that any impairment of the media's freedoms ch. 63.162(1) created affected only matters of newsworthiness rather than matters of real public or general concern, and, by the admission of the newspaper's own counsel, the impairment was minimal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowners brought actions for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to have their property classified and taxed as agricultural. Petitioner county property appraiser had reclassified the property as nonagricultural pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461 (1973). In quashing the decision of the district court and instructing it to affirm the judgment of the trial court upholding the reclassification, the court found ample evidence to sustain the trial judge's findings, with the exception of the application of the &quot;three times rule&quot; of &sect; 193.461(4)(c); since there was no completed sale of the land, the rule did not apply. The court determined that the statute was constitutional, since the legislature's concern was reasonably aroused by the possibility of landowners taking advantage of the agricultural classification, the statute proscribed speculative rezoning and thus was rationally related to the legislative purpose, and the landowner was permitted to rebut the presumption of nonagricultural use. Rejecting the claim of equal protection violation, the court found that the statute was rationally related to the state goal of discouraging speculative rezoning.</SPAN></P>

This court affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence. After petitioner was subsequently denied post-conviction relief, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

Petitioner then filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus. This court denied petitioner relief. Petitioner first argued that he did not receive a meaningful review of his death sentence because this court's consideration of whether to use non-record materials in the review of his death sentence on direct appeal was not made known to his counsel. The court found this contention without merit, concluding that availability of information to it concerning petitioner, a capital defendant, that was not presented at trial and was not part of the trial record or record on appeal was not unconstitutional.

On appeal, his conviction and death sentence were affirmed by the state supreme court.

The court also found appellant's claim that the jury was misinstructed at the penalty phase irrelevant, given that the jurors recommended mercy. The court further held that appellant's challenge to the cold-calculated-premeditated murder aggravator was meritless, the jury itself having found the murder was premeditated. The court did agree that the commission-during-a-robbery aggravator was unproven, although that decision did not affect the sentence. As to the trial court's decision to reject the jury's mercy recommendation, the court held that, given the fact that there were two aggravators proven and no viable mitigator upon which mercy could have been recommended, the recommendation was unreasonable and need not have been followed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a trial court decision that convicted him, following a jury trial, of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death on one count. The state supreme court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Appellant's convictions were supported by substantial, competent evidence. The evidence showed the nature of the intentionally inflicted injuries and supported the jury's finding that appellant intended the consequences of his actions. Appellant's confession was not suppressible as it was not the product of coercion, confusion, or intoxication. An improper judicial remark about a defense witness was corrected by a curative jury instruction. The trial court did not err by overriding the jury's recommended life sentence and imposing a death sentence because aggravating circumstances, including appellant's other first-degree murder conviction, that the murder was committed to prevent arrest, that the murder was especially cruel, and that the murder was cold and premeditated, outweighed the mitigating factors that appellant lacked a significant criminal history and that appellant was only 20 years old at the time of the capital felony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed a trial court decision that convicted appellant of two first-degree murder counts and sentenced him to death on one count. No reversible procedural or evidentiary errors occurred. The trial court judge was justified in overriding the jury's recommended life sentence and imposing the death sentence after finding that the statutory aggravating factors far outweighed the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court denied appellant's contention that it should find the death penalty unconstitutional because all arguments in that area had been previously decided by the court. The court also rejected appellant's argument that exclusion from jury service of all veniremen, whose views on capital punishment were such as to preclude them from assuming the duties of a juror in a capital case, robbed him of a representative jury. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying appellant's motion for change of venue because appellant did not demonstrate a general atmosphere of hostility against him in the community. The court found appellant's other claims to be without merit. The court held that the trial judge properly considered aggravating factors in imposing the death sentence, such as appellant's willing participation in the felony, resulting in the victim's murder. The court did vacate appellant's separate sentence for kidnapping as that was the underlying felony to the felony murder conviction, and the two should have been merged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff public housing tenants filed a class action suit seeking to enjoin defendant housing authority from allowing public access to information provided by public housing tenants and prospective tenants. Plaintiffs appealed the trial court's order granting defendant's motion to dismiss. The trial court ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 119 violated neither Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, nor U.S. Const. amends. I, II, IV, V, IX, or XIV, and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. The supreme court ruled that under Fla. Stat. ch. 119.01, public records were open for personal inspection, and the housing authority was an agency whose records were public under Fla. Stat. ch. 119.011. While certain records were statutorily exempted from the public's right to inspect pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07, the court's examination of the statutes revealed no exemption pertaining to the records involved in plaintiffs' appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who was convicted of murder, child abuse, and child torture contended the trial court erred when it denied his motions to vacate his judgment and death sentence. Petitioner argued his counsel was ineffective. The court held petitioner failed to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of his counsel because he failed to show his counsel's performance was deficient and the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. The court affirmed the denial of petitioner's motion to vacate. In his habeas petition, he contended appellate counsel was ineffective when counsel failed to challenge a jury instruction on felony murder, which included reference to the offense of the abominable and detestable crime against nature. Because the instruction was not objected to at trial, the only way appellate counsel could have obtained review was if the error was fundamental. The court held the instruction did not render petitioner's trial fundamentally unfair, and the failure of his appellate counsel to raise this point on appeal was not a substantial and serious deficiency measurably below the standard of performance expected of competent counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mortgagee sought review of an en banc decision of the Third District Court of Appeals (Florida), which ruled that a deed given to a non-relative in return for love and affection was invalid on its face, but which certified the question of what scope of review should district courts of appeal properly apply when granting rehearings en banc.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that district courts of appeal, in exercising their en banc power, were not limited by case-law standards adopted by the Supreme Court of Florida in the exercise of their discretionary conflict jurisdiction, but were free to develop their own concept of decisional uniformity. Such a ruling was justified as case loads increased throughout the district courts; this en banc process would help avoid decisional conflicts, would assure harmonious decisions within court boundaries, and would develop predictability within the law. The process could only serve finality and uniformity of the law within each court jurisdiction. This was particularly true in cases where, as here, broad decisional discretion was required to attain &quot;uniformity of decisions&quot; when controlling facts in conflicting cases were not the same. As for the instant case, the court ruled that a deed, conveyed by a 90-year old woman to a non-relative for &quot;love and affection,&quot; placed a subsequent grantee on notice that the deed was void for lack of consideration. Thus, the court concluded, the deeds to both grantees must be canceled, as well as the mortgage issued by petitioner bank to the latter grantee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Pari-Mutuel Commission (the Commission) determined that petitioner racing association should be awarded the middle racing dates based on the criteria enumerated in Gulfstream. The determination was reversed, and petitioner sought review. A question was certified to determine the standards applicable to the award of racing dates in Florida, including the viability and application of the &quot;rotation rule&quot; in making that determination. The court held that the district court should have reviewed the record to determine whether there was competent substantial evidence to support the Commission's findings of fact. Rotation was not something departed from, but rather something resorted to, after application of the Gulfstream criteria failed to result in identification of the proper track to be awarded the middle dates. The Commission was vested with the nondelegable discretionary power to allocate racing dates, and the legislature chose not to establish rotation as a rule to be presumptively followed. The Commission was to exercise its discretion according to the Gulfstream standards that the legislature implicitly adopted.</SPAN></P>
