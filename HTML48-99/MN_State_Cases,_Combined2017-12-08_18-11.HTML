</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction from the Polk County District Court (Minnesota) for one count each of first-degree burglary, third-degree criminal sexual conduct, and misdemeanor theft. Appellant also sought review of his sentence for being a dangerous offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Family was staying in a motel room. Husband and wife reported to police that husband awoke and appellant was performing oral sex on him. Husband detained appellant until police arrived. Evidence at the scene indicated the screen had been pulled away from the motel room window. Appellant told police that he had been in the motel room for a drug transaction but at trial testified that the victims had paid him to engage in sex with them. Appellant's convictions for burglary, criminal sexual conduct, and misdemeanor theft were affirmed. Without notice of appellant's consent defense, the state did not have notice that facts would be at issue. The language of the jury instruction did not indicate that appellant had the burden of proving consent. The court would not reverse a conviction based on an improper discovery sanction where the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The state's efforts to locate the victims were sufficient to support the court's finding of unavailability. Appellant's sentence as a dangerous offender was also affirmed. When he was sentenced for the current offense, appellant had unexpired sentences for prior burglaries, which included sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence because: appellant was required to disclose his consent defense; the district court's instruction correctly stated the law; the victims were unavailable; and appellant's prior convictions were for burglaries which included sexual assaults.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed conviction because evidence was sufficient to support his conviction. The court reversed awards of disbursements because appellee state could not recover for out of state travel expenses for witnesses. As any possible prejudice was minimized by the district court's immediate curative action, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Anoka County District Court (Minnesota), which required him to complete a sex-offender treatment program, register as a sex offender, and provide a DNA sample after he pleaded guilty to third-degree assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was originally charged with criminal sexual conduct in the third degree under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.344 (1996), but he pleaded guilty to third degree assault. The district court required appellant to complete a sex-offender treatment program, register as a sex offender, and provide a DNA sample. Appellant objected to undergoing sex-offender treatment, but did not object to registering as a sex offender or providing a DNA sample. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring appellant to undergo sex-offender treatment program, because Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.3452(3) (1996) required treatment if an assessment indicated that the offender was in need of and amenable to sex offender treatment, unless the offender was sentenced to prison. Since appellant was originally charged with criminal sexual conduct, his conviction was another offense arising out of a charge based on the sex offense, which under &sect; 609.3452 required the court to order a sex-offender treatment assessment. Requiring a DNA sample and sex offender registration was also proper because the conviction arose out of the same set of circumstances as the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment requiring appellant to complete a sex-offender treatment program, register as a sex offender, and provide a DNA sample, because the psychological assessment recommended sex offender treatment and because appellant was convicted of a crime arising out of a charge based on the sex offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a judgment from the Isanti County District Court (Minnesota) convicting him of fifth-degree controlled substance crime in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.025, sub. 2(1) (1996), and possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of Minn. State. &sect; 152.092 (1996). Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the search producing the physical evidence and the evidentiary basis for the chain of custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was stopped for speeding. When asked to step out of his car, he kicked his taillight in. The officer detected the smell of drugs as he frisked defendant for weapons. The frisk resulted in the discovery of drug paraphernalia and drug residue. The officer bagged the evidence and deposited it in a locked evidence drop-box. Defendant challenged his drug offense convictions on grounds that the search was unconstitutional and the chain of custody was not established. The court found that scope of the search was constitutionally proper. The officer was justified in searching defendant for weapons following his hostile outburst and could have reasonably believed the drug paraphernalia might have been weapons. Because officer was justified in removing them, and because he smelled marijuana, he had probable cause to believe he would find more evidence of drugs on defendant. Thus, the further search was valid. The chain of custody was fully established by officer's testimony, even though he lacked independent recollection as to how the evidence was dealt with. The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence, and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant's convictions for fifth-degree controlled substance crime and possession of drug paraphernalia were affirmed. The officer conducted a valid Terry frisk after defendant's hostile outburst. The discovery of drug paraphernalia established probable cause to conduct the further search that led to discovery of drugs. Officer's testimony established an unbroken chain of custody, despite his lack of independent recollection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator power company challenged a decision from respondent, the Nobles County Board of Commissioners (Minnesota), denying relator's request for a conditional use permit. Relator argued that respondent's denial of the permit was unlawful and without factual basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal by certiorari, relator power company argued that respondent county board of commissioner's denial of a conditional use permit was unlawful, without factual basis, and an improper revenue measure. The county planning commission had held a hearing regarding relator's conditional use permit (CUP). It found that relator's contemplated placement of new lines and poles would negatively affect the county's plan to widen the road and its plan to acquire slope easements to prevent snow drifts and enhance traffic. The commission thus recommended that respondent deny relator's CUP. Respondent agreed with the commission's recommendations, adopted its findings of fact, and denied relator's permit application. The court noted that local authority over land use was entitled to great deference, and the court would not overturn a county board of commissioner's decision unless it had no rational basis. The denial of the CUP was affirmed because the facts in the record satisfied the rational basis test. However, the court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction issues related to the validity of the amended county zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the conditional use permit to relator power company was affirmed because respondent county board of commissioner's findings adequately showed that the conditional use permit was validly denied for public health, safety, and welfare reasons. The court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction issues related to the validity of the amended county zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of a judgment from the Scott County District Court (Minnesota), which granted summary judgment in favor of respondent insurer and respondent private investigation firm.

Stat. &sect; 176.82 and that the manner of respondents' surveillance amounted to harassment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was injured during the course of his employment and received workers' compensation payments. Respondent insurer hired respondent private investigation firm to conduct surveillance of appellant. Appellant brought an action alleging that respondents obstructed his receipt of workers' compensation benefits in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.82. Appellant also claimed the manner of surveillance amounted to harassment prohibited by state law. The appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the trial court, which granted summary judgment in favor of respondents. Although the trial court erred in determining that only employers may be held liable under &sect; 176.82, summary judgment was appropriate because appellant failed to present evidence that respondents impeded his receipt of benefits. The trial court properly determined that there was no private civil cause of action for harassment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.749. The appellate court reversed, however, the denial of appellant's motion to reinstate his privacy claim, holding that the trial court erred in determining that the privacy rights recognized in Lake v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged a pretrial order of the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) that required appellant to show that notice was given to respondent of his ineligibility to possess a shotgun pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.713 (1996). Respondent argued that the district court erred by denying respondent's motion to suppress evidence based on an illegal search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent had been adjudicated delinquent, and due to the previous adjudication, respondent was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.713 (1996). The district court determined that notice was a required element of the offense and because respondent was not given notice, he could not be convicted under the statute. Respondent challenged the court's denial of his motion to suppress. The state appealed, arguing that ignorance of the law was not a defense to a charge of unlawful possession, and reversal of the district court order was warranted. On review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that protection of human life justified the warrantless search and seizure, and respondent's constitutional rights were not violated. The court found that officers responded to reports of shots fired, and they saw two men with shotguns. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.713, subd. 3 (1996) did not apply to respondent because the notice subdivision did not include possession of a shotgun or a &quot;firearm&quot; among the violations requiring notice. Notice of respondent's ineligibility to possess a shotgun was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court that required appellant state to show that notice was given to respondent and that denied respondent's motion to suppress evidence was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The protection of human life justified the warrantless search and seizure, and the evidence of the shotguns was admissible. The plain meaning of the statute did not require that notice be given of ineligibility to possess a shotgun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of violating respondent's ordinance prohibiting the use of storage boats. Appellant brought an action challenging the validity of the ordinance, and the district court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment and ordered appellant to remove his storage boat, or convert it into a houseboat. Appellant claimed the district court erred in upholding the validity of the ordinance. Respondent asserted it had the authority to regulate the types of boats that could use the lake. Pursuant to this authority, it passed an ordinance prohibiting the use of storage boats to advance the public welfare by preserving and promoting the use of the lake and its shorelands for all. Thus, the court found the ordinance was substantially related to promoting the public welfare. Because appellant failed to show that the ordinance bore no substantial relationship to public health, safety, or welfare, it was not unreasonable, and the district court did not err in upholding the validity of the ordinance. The court also found that there was no taking, because appellant could remove his storage boat and use it elsewhere, or convert it into a houseboat. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of his third DWI offense within five years. The police seized his truck, valued at $ 13,550, for forfeiture under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.1217. Appellant filed a civil complaint alleging that the truck was improperly seized. On the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found the pickup truck was subject to forfeiture and granted summary judgment against appellant. On review, appellant argued that forfeiture of the vehicle violated the Due Process Clause, the Takings Clause, the Double Jeopardy Clause, and the Excessive Fines Clause of the Minnesota and U. S. Constitutions, U.S. Const. amends. V, VIII, and XIV, Minn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 3, 7 and 13. The court held that because vehicle forfeiture was a reasonable means to a permissive objective, the statute withstood substantive due process scrutiny. Because the property was not taken under the power of eminent domain, the forfeiture of the vehicle used in criminal activity did not violate the federal or state takings clause. The court affirmed the judgment, finding the forfeiture was not grossly disproportional to the gravity of a repeat DWI violation, or a double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment against appellant, affirming the forfeiture of his truck after his third DWI within five years, because it was a remedial measure taken to protect the public from the serious problem of repeat DWI offenders such as appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent's driver's license was revoked, and she filed a petition for judicial review of the revocation. She argued the portion of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123, subd. 5c(b)(3) that requires petitioner for judicial review of a driver's license revocation to state the facts underlying each claim asserted as a basis for recission violated her constitutional right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. The trial court agreed and rescinded the revocation order. Appellant Commissioner of Public Safety challenged the order. Because respondent did not have standing to challenge the statute, the court reversed and remanded. There is no standing to raise a constitutional challenge absent a direct and personal harm resulting from the alleged denial of constitutional rights. The trial court concluded that the statements in the petition amounted to an admission based on the inference that respondent was the driver because she asserted rights that belong to a driver. Such an inference is not testimony within the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination. Thus, respondent did not show that she sustained or was in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed the decision to indeterminately commit petitioner to the Minnesota Sexual Psychopathic Personality Treatment Center as a sexually dangerous person. The court first refused to rule that the sexually dangerous person statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a), was unconstitutional. Because petitioner was not treated prior to his commitment even though he was given the opportunity, the court refused to consider petitioner's argument concerning the lack of treatment, and held that petitioner's right against self-incrimination was not violated. Finally, the court held that petitioner was given the protection of due process, that the requirements needed to demonstrate that petitioner was a sexually dangerous person were proven, and that indeterminate commitment was the least restrictive appropriate placement. Therefore, the court affirmed the indeterminate placement of petitioner in the Minnesota Sexual Psychopathic Personality Treatment Center as a sexually dangerous person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) that voided appellant's assessments against respondents' properties for certain improvements. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in not deferring to appellant's findings on property value, the evidence was sufficient to show an increase in value to respondents' properties, and the trial court erred in prohibiting appellant from reassessing respondents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment that voided its assessments against respondents' properties for the cost of a street and sewer improvements when the trial court ruled that appellant did not present evidence show any increase in value to the properties. The court affirmed, as modified, the judgment. The court rejected appellant's claim that its evidence was sufficient to show an increase in value to respondents' properties. The court ruled that, in light of the parties' conflicting evidence on the issue, the trial court properly refused to speculate as to the effect of the improvements on property values and properly explained why it discredited appellant's evidence and expert testimony. The court also rejected appellant's claim that the trial court erred in not applying a presumption of validity to the assessments, ruling that respondents' adverse evidence to the issue of valuation rebutted the presumption. Nonetheless, the court ruled, because the trial court did not specifically find that the improvements conferred no benefit on the properties, appellant was entitled to reassess the properties to obtain evidence that the properties were in fact benefitted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town sought review of the judgment of the St. Louis County District Court (Minnesota) that found that Lakewood, Minn., Zoning Ordinance art. III, &sect; 2(HH) (1996) was void for vagueness under U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV as applied to respondent, a landowner, and entered judgment for respondent on plaintiff's civil complaint for an order to have respondent remove her junk cars and salvage from her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a town, filed civil and criminal complaints against respondent, a landowner, for violating Lakewood, Minn., Zoning Ordinance art. III, &sect; 2(HH) (1996) by keeping three or more junk cars and other salvage items on her property. The civil complaint sought an order declaring that respondent violated the ordinance, enjoining her continued violations, and granting plaintiff damages. The trial court entered judgment for respondent. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's memorandum was a proper finding of fact and law under Minn. R. Civ. P. 52.01. Because the ordinance defined a junk vehicle as one without a current license, and because respondent had licenses for all but two of her vehicles, she did not violate the junk vehicle portion of the ordinance. The court held that respondent was entitled to due process pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. V and U.S. Const. amend. XIV in both the civil and criminal complaints against her. Therefore, because the term &quot;salvage&quot; was vague, and because plaintiff did not notify respondent about which items were salvage, the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague as applied to respondent. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent landowner on plaintiff town's complaint for an order to have respondent remove junk cars and salvage items from her property. The court held that because respondent had fewer than three unlicensed cars, she did not violate the ordinance against storing junk cars, and because respondent had no notice of what other items were salvage, that part of the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued appellee police officer for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Appellant was stopped and searched by appellee. Appellant was also struck on the head. The lower court found appellee had qualified immunity when he stopped, frisked, and arrested appellant. The trial court entered a directed verdict on appellant's assault claim and the jury found appellee did not use excessive force. Appellant sought review. The court reversed because in order to establish a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, appellant was required to prove that appellee, acting under the color of state law, violated his rights under the federal constitution. Appellee's conduct was protected by qualified immunity only if a reasonable officer could have believed his actions were lawful. The court found probable cause existed for the stop, but there was no objective basis to justify suspicion appellant was armed and dangerous to justify the frisk. Therefore, the frisk was a violation of appellant's rights. The trial court's denial of a deadly force instruction was erroneous because the jury should have considered the evidence surrounding the officer's use of force to determine whether it was justifiable.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the statute did not apply to respondents' project and that enactment of the statute violated the state constitution.

The court found that because two differing interpretations represented reasonable readings of the statute, the provision was ambiguous, and legislative intent required the interpretation that it applied the prevailing wage act to all educational projects costing more than $ 100,000.

The officer testified he had observed defendant make a U-turn, and suspected she was in violation of a curfew ordinance. Therefore, the stop was not the product of mere whim, caprice, or idle curiosity, and the court did not err in concluding the stop was lawful. Defendant argued that the evidence of her driver's license revocation should have been suppressed because the suspicion justifying the stop was dispelled when defendant gave the officer a state identification card stating her age. The officer testified he suspected defendant did not have a valid driver's license because she failed to produce one when asked.

Stat. &sect; 169.123, subd. 4(e)(4) (Supp. 1997) for operating a motor vehicle with an alcohol concentration of .23. The court reversed the order rescinding the revocation of respondent's driver's license, finding there was no violation of respondent's rights to due process in the revocation process. The court determined that respondent's driver's license was an important property interest subject to due process protection and that the required protection was provided by the availability of a temporary license and the opportunity for immediate administrative review. The court could not conclude that the increase in the waiting period for a limited license imposed an impermissible burden on respondent's interest in continued possession of his license. The court found that the waiting periods for return of driving privileges that increased in direct proportion to the severity of a driver's conduct reflected a rational plan for protecting the compelling public interest in highway safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to prison. Appellant then filed a habeas corpus petition asserting that prison policies which required him to perform work assignments and that deducted room and board costs from his wages rendered his convictions invalid because they incorporated additional punishments and constituted involuntary servitude in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIII. The trial court denied appellant's petition, and appellant sought the court's review. The court held that a writ of habeas corpus was a statutory civil remedy available to obtain relief from unlawful imprisonment or restraint, and could also be used to raise claims involving fundamental constitutional rights and significant restraints on a defendant's liberty, or to challenge conditions of confinement. Here, appellant failed to establish a deprivation of any fundamental constitutional rights as work requirements had been upheld as constitutional and a violation of the prohibition against involuntary servitude, and where policies that withheld money from prison wages to offset incarceration costs did not constitute additional punishments for the same offense. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>

There was extensive testimony as to the likelihood of emotional harm to the victims. The testimony by four experts established the extreme harm that would likely be caused by an adult's sexual contact with children, regardless of whether it was violent or nonviolent. The sexually dangerous person (SDP) statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18c(a)(3) (Supp. 1997), required that the person had to be likely to engage in acts of harmful sexual conduct. The district court's consideration of relevant factors for predicting dangerousness satisfied the statute. The district court used the proper standard in the indeterminate commitment. There was no statutory provision for the court's appointment of an independent expert for the patient at the county's expense. Defendant did not show that in a civil commitment proceeding he was entitled to the appointment of an independent expert. The SDP law was treated as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A school district employee was directed to operate under specific budgetary constraints, including reducing her staff from four individuals to two individuals. After one of the staff resigned, the employee identified two of the three individuals as junior in seniority and laid off the teacher. The teacher successfully filed suit, alleging she was laid off merely because she had opted to take maternity leave. The appellate court initially noted to determine whether official immunity was waived required a finding that the alleged discriminatory acts of the officials were the type of conduct covered by official immunity, and that the alleged discriminatory acts, even though of the type covered by official immunity, were malicious or willful. The appellate court held the conduct at issue, the layoff of the teacher, was necessitated by budgetary constraints and the act was conduct that was objectively and legally reasonable. The appellate court concluded the employee acted in good faith and with subjective legal reasonableness in deciding to lay the teacher off; thus the employee and the school district were entitled to official immunity.</SPAN></P>

Two years later, defendant was charged with DWI and test refusal offenses in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121, subd. 3(c)(2). Because his license had been revoked under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.123 within five years prior to these offenses, the DWI and test refusal offenses were enhanced from misdemeanors to gross misdemeanors. The district court determining that such an enhancement violated the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. On the State's appeal, the court concluded that defendant had failed to demonstrate that the enhancement statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt, holding that, although the right to counsel was more expansive under the state constitution, the implied consent revocation was a civil finding that may be used to enhance subsequent criminal charges, even if a defendant was uncounseled in the civil findings. Similarly, enhancement statutes did not punish the former act, but rather, merely stiffened the penalty for the later crime, therefore, it was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought a negligence action against the school district on behalf of her son, injured during a fire drill and on other occasions. The son had a condition that rendered his muscles weak. The lower court granted the school district's motion for summary judgment. Upon appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The mother had not provided sufficient details to support the claim of negligence on other occasions. Given the school district's knowledge of the son's condition and the recommendations of his individualized education program, fact issues existed as to whether the teacher's conduct was reasonable and caused the son's injury during the drill. Because there were guidelines for dealing with the son's condition, the teacher's conduct during the fire drill involved the exercise of a ministerial duty not protected by official immunity. The district court abused its discretion in denying the mother's motion to amend her complaint to add claims of battery and assault because that was a fact issue for the jury. The single incident of grabbing without physical injury did not establish a constitutional violation recoverable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

The tribe formed the PAC for the purpose of making political contributions to recipients outside the reservation. The Board declared that the tribe was required to make disclosures pursuant to Minn.

The court held that the tribe failed to establish that a legal remedy was inadequate and that the injunction was necessary to prevent great and irreparable injury. All five factors weighed against issuing the injunction: (1) the nature and background of the parties' previous relationship; (2) the harm to be suffered by the Board if the injunction is issued as compared to the harm to be suffered by the tribe if it is denied; (3) the likelihood that tribe would prevail on the merits; (4) public policy considerations; and (5) administrative burdens involved in enforcement of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor successfully challenged the creditor's garnishment of his wages, but the district court denied his motion for sanctions against the creditor. On appeal, the debtor sought a declaration that the statutorily authorized prejudgment garnishment procedures were unconstitutional and contended that sanctions were warranted. The court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 571.71(2) (1996) because there was no justiciable controversy related to the statute. The garnishment was discharged on the basis of improper service of the original summons and complaint. Therefore, the statute was not being applied to the debtor's disadvantage. The court affirmed the denial of sanctions, concluding that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in finding that the creditor acted in accordance with &sect; 571.71(2) and that its actions were not unreasonable. The court denied the motions for attorney fees on appeal, in part because neither party complied with Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being seen lingering in a dead end street known for criminal activity, defendant was stopped for committing a traffic violation. He confessed. The appellate court found neither a violation of defendant's constitutional rights nor reversible error. The record contained no credible suggestion of police overreaching or any other substantial violation. Defendant failed to raise, at the trial level, the issue that his detention in the back seat of the police officer's car was an unconstitutional seizure. Despite notice, in the State's pre-trial motion, defendant limited the focus of the case to the Scales custodial-interrogation recording requirement. Neither the scope nor the duration of the interrogation was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV or Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The failure to record the interrogation was not a substantial violation as there was no gross, willful, or prejudicial conduct. Additionally, it was reasonable for the officer to separate defendant and his female passenger to prevent collaboration of their stories.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped a person who was riding a motorcycle (operator) after the officer thought he saw the operator make a left turn without signaling. After he stopped the operator, the officer determined that the operator was under the influence of alcohol. At his trial to review a decision revoking his driver's license, the operator offered testimony from an expert who conducted an analysis of an enhanced, digitized copy of the videotape which the officer made while following the operator and that tape showed that the operator had signaled his turn three times. However, the trial court was not able to detect flashes from the turn signal when it reviewed the unenhanced videotape because a lens flare caused by the motorcycle's brake light obscured the flashes. The appellate court held that, based on the testimony, the trial court had not reached a conclusion that was clearly erroneous when it decided that the stop was legal because the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the operator had violated state traffic laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia: (1) that the district court was required to find whether he actually met the criteria for commitment; (2) that he did not continue to satisfy the criteria for commitment as a SPP; and (3) that the district court did not have clear and convincing evidence from which to conclude that he continued to satisfy the criteria for commitment as a SDP. The district court properly assessed whether defendant's condition had changed, rather than making new findings as to whether he met the standards for commitment. A social worker testified she had no basis to conclude defendant had any greater skill managing his sexual impulses than he did at the time of the initial commitment, had observed no changes, and continued to consider him highly likely to offend. The evidence, including expert testimony, showed defendant continued to be highly likely to engage in acts of harmful sexual conduct in the future.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had adopted a plan which phased out the concrete plant, among other industrial items, so that the area could be used for high density residential use. The city used a combination of recoupment of investment and tax depreciation status as factors in determining the useful life for the plant. The appellate court held the two factors provided the city with a reasonable basis to determine the plant's useful life for purposes of establishing an amortization period. In establishing the amortization period for the plant, the city considered each of the factors in its amortization ordinance and its findings regarding those factors were supported by record. Because the city's action was a legislative decision, the district court did not err in deferring to the city's broad discretion to adopt an ordinance establishing a two-year amortization period for the plant. Because the plant did not demonstrate disparate treatment of similarly situated property owners resulting from the enactment of the amortization ordinance, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued on appeal the administrative law judge (ALJ) committed error when he ordered the child support obligation modification to be made retroactive to the notice of review, required the father to pay the full dependent health insurance premium, and declined to address the issue of dependent income tax deduction. The appellate court agreed with the father that under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.5511, subd. 1 (Supp. 1997), modification of child support could be made retroactive only to the date of the notice of proposed order for modification. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded the ALJ erred in ordering modified child support retroactive to a full year before the commencement of the proceeding. The appellate court noted the ALJ ordered the father to pay 100 percent of the mental and dental insurance expense for the child, including the full premium, without providing any related findings of fact. The appellate court concluded the record contained no findings to support the ALJ's determination. Finally, the appellate court determined the record did not support a finding that the ALJ abused his discretion in declining to award the father the tax deduction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was given a trespass warning that stated that it applied to all Minneapolis Public Housing Authority (MPHA) property. Several days later, defendant was arrested for trespassing because he was in the vicinity of a housing project. Defendant alleged that he had friends and family who lived in the neighborhood. Defendant alleged that Minneapolis, Minnesota, Code of Ordinances &sect; 385.380 (1997) was unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibited defendant's constitutionally protected right of association and his right to visit friends and family who lived in public housing. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional, but that it had been unconstitutionally applied. The court concluded that, although, as an agent for a tenant, the MPHA was authorized to demand that a trespasser leave a particular property, the MPHA's authority did not allow the MPHA to exclude a trespasser from all public housing in the city. Neither a tenant, the MPHA, nor the police could ban an individual from all public housing property in the city. The MPHA was allowed to issue a demand to depart and not return only for a specific MPHA property.</SPAN></P>

The ex-husband argued that his support obligation terminated when the child was emancipated pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.54, subd. 2 (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife was awarded custody of the parties' disabled son and their other child in the judgment dissolving the marriage. The parties stipulated that the ex-husband would pay support until one attained the age of majority, became emancipated, died, or until further order. The administrative law judge denied the ex-husband's motion to terminate support for the disabled son when he reached the age of 20. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that a Minnesota Supreme Court case that addressed the issue did not preclude consideration of the child's needs after the child reached the age of majority, in light of the affidavits of both parents that showed they were aware of the child's disability and need for ongoing support. The court noted that Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.54, subd. 2 lacked an upper age limit on persons who could be deemed children. The court indicated that the child was incapable of self-support and the ex-husband functionally stipulated to paying support for the child indefinitely under &sect; 518.54, subd. 2. The court concluded that the administrative law judge did not abuse her discretion by holding the ex-husband to his stipulation.</SPAN></P>

The drivers argued that the Robbinsdale, Minn., Ordinance &sect; 510.17, subd. 2(b), violated their constitutional guarantee of equal protection because it distinguished, without legitimate basis, between truck tractors and RVs. The city had to show a rational reason for its ordinance. The city's statement of the purpose of the ordinance was the promotion of the safety and general welfare of the public. Over the years the use and parking of truck tractors in residential neighborhoods generated numerous complaints. The city therefore put forth a reasonable basis for the ordinance. The city was not equitably estopped from enforcing its ordinance against one of the drivers for parking his tractor at his residence. The driver provided no evidence of wrongful conduct on the city's part. The mere failure of the city to ticket him earlier did not rise to a level of wrongful action. Persons could not acquire a vested right to an illegal use of property.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pled guilty to two counts of terroristic threats. The Dakota County District Court, Minnesota, stayed imposition of sentence and placed defendant on probation for five years. Defendant violated his probation on several occasions and the trial court revoked his probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court continued defendant's case to grant defendant time to obtain counsel. Subsequently, it denied defendant's request for another continuance. The appellate court concluded that a further continuance would not have materially affected the outcome of the proceeding and that defendant was not unconstitutionally deprived of his right to counsel. The appellate court held that defendant contacted the victim's attorney and violated his probation. Also, the contacts were plainly intentional and inexcusable. The seriousness of the violation was underscored by defendant's history of abuse of the victim. Thus, the trial court plainly did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant's probation. The appellate court held that the trial court's use of the word &quot;concurrent&quot; only referred to the terms of probation rather than to whatever sentences might ultimately be imposed. However, the trial court did not have authority to make the sentence for the gross misdemeanor order for protection violation, which had been subject to a stay of execution rather than of imposition, consecutive to defendant's felony sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court modified defendant's sentence for a gross misdemeanor order-for-protection violation to run concurrently with his felony sentences and affirmed the trial court's judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate state appellate court stated it would continue to find the sexually dangerous person (SDP) act constitutional, pending further direction. The testimony was sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the offender's victims suffered serious emotional harm. That harm, together with testimony regarding the offender's personality disorders and likely future conduct, proved by clear and convincing evidence that the offender engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct and was likely to engage in such conduct in the future. The court did not rely on police reports to prove that the offender committed fifth and sixth degree criminal sexual conduct. The district court did not convict the offender of any criminal offenses; it found clear and convincing evidence that the offender had committed the offenses, which satisfied due process requirements in the civil SDP proceedings. There was no requirement that the offender be committed to the least restrictive alternative. The psychologist's qualifications were sufficient to support naming him an expert witness, and the offender's objections went to the weight of the testimony, not its admissibility.</SPAN></P>

The council member claimed that the council's act of passing the resolution to remove her from office was retaliatory and in violation of her First Amendment rights.

The court held that the council's act of passing the resolution was legislative and protected by immunity. The council member argued that she still had a triable claim based on harassment by council members and city staff who ostracized her, but the court held that she pointed to no evidence to support her claims.

The court affirmed, holding (1) the ALJ did not abuse her discretion in relying on the wage information provided by the father's employer rather than relying on the father's estimates, (2) the ALJ did not err in including the father's overtime pay in her calculation of his net monthly income because the father failed to present evidence or argue that he satisfied the factors set forth in Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two men were arrested and charged with a drug offense. Investigators offered to reduce the charge if they could arrange a larger drug deal. The men then told police they were going to drive to a market to meet defendant and exchange some cocaine for money. Police followed a car that left defendant's house, went to the market, and then followed the vehicle driven by the two men to a hotel parking lot. After both cars drove into the hotel parking lot, the police confronted the occupants. Under defendant's passenger seat, police located a package of a suspected controlled substance, later determined to be a large amount of cocaine hydrochloride. At trial, the trial court instructed the jury on &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; in accordance with Minn. Jury Instructions Crim. No. 3.03 (1990). After defendant was convicted, the appellate court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in charging the jury on proof beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with that instruction. It further found reversal was not required simply because defendant would have preferred that other language be used in the instruction and that the jury was adequately instructed regarding &quot;reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the father started receiving social security disability payments and the child began receiving dependency benefits as the father's dependent. The father asserted that the child's receipt of these benefits obviated additional child support. On appeal, the court found that the father's child support obligation should have been modified. The court stated that the father's ability to pay had increased since the prior order, therefore the administrative law judge (ALJ) correctly concluded that the father did not show any change in his circumstances that would have rendered the prior order unfair. The court stated, however, that the father was entitled to a modification of his obligation because a disabled child support obligor was entitled to a credit for social security disability benefits paid on behalf of a child for whom the obligor had a duty of support. The court concluded that the ALJ had to reduce the father's prospective child support obligations by the amount of the dependency benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that there had been a substantial change in his income making the original child support order unreasonable or unfair. The court found no abuse of discretion in the decision that although the father's job duties changed, his income remained essentially the same, and it affirmed the order. The court explained that the child support guidelines referred to &quot;ordinary and necessary&quot; expenses in the context of determining income from self-employment, Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.551, subd. 5b(e) (Supp. 1997), but did not expressly refer to deductions for depreciation or other business expenses. As such, the court opined that while a court could consider depreciation deductions in determining an obligor's net monthly income in certain circumstances, the decision to credit business expenses or deductions was within the lower court's discretion. Although the father argued that he should have been permitted to deduct business rent that he paid his current spouse, the court concluded that payments to a spouse that had the effect of decreasing income without clear proof of the validity of the payments were subject to disallowance.</SPAN></P>

The record showed that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity when he ran a random check of the van's license plate, found that the owner's driver's license was suspended, and observed someone driving the van.

He asserted that the definition of &quot;sell&quot; was overbroad and an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. Defendant argued in the alternative that even if the definition was not overbroad, a narrow application should have been applied to Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.01, subd. 15a(2) (1996). Neither Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.021, subd. 1(1) (1997) nor Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.01, subd. 15a(2) (1996) included a specific intent element on its face. The court agreed with defendant that a strict, literal reading of the statute would result in unconstitutional and absurd results. A commonsense reading of the statute required an intent element read into the statute. The legislature did not intend an absurd, impossible, or unreasonable result and did not intend to violate the state or federal constitution. The court also stated that the evidence presented was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for intending to sell cocaine. As to the amount he offered to sell, his own admission was that it was more than 10 grams; therefore, the court affirmed the decision of the district court.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that appellants failed to properly serve the application to vacate an arbitration award, and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governed arbitrability but that all other issues were controlled by Minnesota law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought claims in arbitration under Minnesota law alleging misrepresentation and unauthorized trading by respondents. One appellant had previously signed a margin agreement that contained both an agreement to arbitrate and a choice-of-law provision. The agreement provided that the FAA would govern all questions of arbitrability; the choice-of-law provision specified that the agreement would be governed by Minnesota law. After arbitrators dismissed appellants' claims, appellants served notice on respondents of an application to vacate the award. The district court concluded that the FAA governed the arbitrability of disputes but that all other issues, including service of process, were controlled by Minnesota law. The court affirmed on appeal, finding that although the district court incorrectly implied that the margin agreement applied to both appellants, it correctly concluded that Minnesota's requirements for personal service applied to the motion to vacate. Moreover, because Minnesota's requirements for service were general court rules that applied to all civil actions and were not designed to impede private arbitration contracts, they were not preempted by the FAA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the officer initially spoke to the driver, he observed that the driver's eyes were bloodshot, watery, and glassy. The officer observed two beer cans in the passenger area of the driver's vehicle and then discovered that he was concealing an open beer can between his legs. At that point, the officer arrested the driver for violating the open bottle law. The driver argued that the revocation should be rescinded, as his arrest resulted from an illegal search and seizure, and when the officer invoked the implied consent statute, the officer lacked probable cause to believe that he was driving under the influence of alcohol. The court ruled that the facts known to the officer at the time he invoked the implied consent statute were sufficient to establish probable cause for him to believe that the driver was driving under the influence of alcohol. Furthermore, the driver did not raise the specific issue of whether the officer's head was inside or outside of the vehicle when he observed the beer cans in the vehicle's passenger side, and therefore waived that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped defendant for driving erratically. A background check revealed that defendant was a user and seller of methamphetamine. The police officer obtained permission to search defendant's pockets, where he found methamphetamine. After arresting defendant, the police officer searched his truck and found more drugs. Defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the duration of defendant's detention was justifiable because, after ascertaining that defendant had not been drinking, the police officer wanted to determine why he was swerving. The short time taken to check for information about defendant was relatively brief. Further, the district court's determination that defendant voluntarily consented was not clearly erroneous because the police officer asked defendant if he could have looked in his pockets, and stated that defendant replied, &quot;Sure, go ahead.&quot; While defendant claimed that he felt that the deputy was going to search him regardless of what he said, he failed to state any facts to support his claimed intimidation or provide any explanation of why he felt intimidated by the police officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that specific intent to violate the order was an element of the crime.

The appellate court held that it was that defendant knew the order for protection existed, that he knew that the order prohibited him from contacting his wife, and that he contacted her anyway. He therefore violated the order for protection, and, consequently, Minn. Stat. &sect; 518B.01, subd. 14.

The appellate court held that, if the legislature intended to foreclose the taxpayer's ability to await the commissioner's decision before suing for a refund, it would have adopted relevant, unambiguous language. The statute clearly gave the taxpayers the option to await the commissioner's decision on their refund claims. The claims remained &quot;alive&quot; for statute of limitations purposes until 18 months after the commissioner denied them. Letters from the commissioner constituted denials of the claims causing the 18-month statute of limitations, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 289A.50, subd. 7(b) (1996), to apply. The taxpayers were permitted to seek judicial redress within that time period. The commissioner had a duty to examine returns or pay refund claims under Minn.

The injured party filed a motion to have the lien eliminated or reduced, and the district court granted the motion. The department appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that the enactment of &sect; 62A.095, which provided that health plans could not exercise subrogation rights until the insured person made a full recovery from another source, did not affect the constitutionality of the medical assistance lien provisions enacted in &sect; 256B.042. The court determined that the separate and distinct sources of funds for the medical assistance program and private health insurance prevented a determination that individuals who received medical assistance benefits were similarly situated to individuals covered by private health insurance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First appellant challenged a district court's post judgment order delaying her ability to collect on her homestead lien until her children were emancipated. Second appellant asked the court to overrule In Re Marriage of Haynes and credit disabled child support obligors for social security benefits paid on behalf of children for whom they have a support obligation. Third appellant challenged an administrative law judge's amended order denying his motion for reduced child support. On appeal, the issues were (1) whether the administrative child support process governed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.5511 (1996) violated the separation of powers required by Minn. Const. art. III, &sect; 1; (2) whether the district court erred in modifying first appellant's homestead lien; and (3) whether a disabled child support obligor should have been credited for social security disability benefits paid on behalf of the child for whom the obligation was owed.

The mother died, and a social worker informed the father that no parentage form was ever filed. The mother's parents assumed custody of the child. The father then signed a form entitled an affidavit to retain parental rights and returned it to the department. Several weeks later, the grandparents adopted the child without providing notice to the father. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the father's challenge to the adoption. The court rejected the father's argument that he was entitled to notice because he filed an affidavit pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 259.51. The court found that the father's affidavit was not timely filed, and the father failed to show good cause for missing the 90-day deadline.

The district court dismissed the petition without prejudice but later noted it had not been informed that this was a second petition. The county petitioned to commit defendant as both an SPP and an SDP. The hearing on this third petition was held and defendant was committed. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that delays were caused in part by defendant's counsel ordering the evaluation after the deadline for a hearing.

The defendant appealed the classification to an administrative law judge, which affirmed the classification. Defendant again appealed. On review, the court reversed and held that where a statute was ambiguous and one interpretation gave rise to a constitutional conflict, a court would adopt an interpretation that stood in harmony with the Constitution, even if the alternative construction might have otherwise seemed a more accurate reflection of legislative intent. In addition, the court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.052 defined &quot;sex offender&quot; and &quot;offender&quot; as a person who was convicted of an offense for which registration under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was committed to the secured mental health facility for an indefinite period after being found to be mentally ill and dangerous. The patient's previous violent acts included assaulting his pregnant wife resulting in the death of the unborn child, stabbing his sister, assaulting his father and police officers, threatening to kill his girlfriend, and attempting to burn down the motel at which he was staying. The patient had been delusional, had heard voices, and was hyperactive and quick to anger. The commissioner denied the petition because the patient was not actively involved in treatment, refused to attend his chemical dependency program, refused psychological testing and meeting with physicians, and refused to participate in a work plan offered to him. The court held that the appeal panel correctly determined that a transfer was not appropriate until the patient demonstrated a clear acceptance of his chemical dependency and participated for a substantial period of time in treatment at his current location. It was reasonable to infer that the patient would continue to engage in violent and assaultive behavior without appropriate treatment.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that: (1) the State properly established the validity of the stop based upon testimony of the police officers that the vehicle matched the description of the involved vehicle in the incident; (2) the search of defendant's mouth was constitutionally valid because the officer had probable cause to conduct the search, and the search fit the exception to the warrant requirement for exigent circumstances, based upon a threat of imminent destruction of evidence; and (3) a choke-hold by the officer to prevent the destruction of evidence was reasonable and did not invalidate the search.</SPAN></P>

Defendant later pleaded guilty to gross misdemeanor harassment based on two letters he sent to the girlfriend. Defendant's convictions in the instant case stemmed from an additional four letters he sent to the girlfriend. Each count of felony harassment involved the sending of two letters, and the witness tampering charge was based on one of the four letters. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Defendant's conduct supported his convictions for harassment because the sending of two letters could constitute acting repeatedly. Defendant waived his right to remove evidence of his prior harassment conviction from the jury. The trial court properly instructed the jury that the offense of harassment required specific intent. Defendant's conduct supported his conviction for witness tampering because he sent a threatening letter to the victim on the day before his appearance on the first harassment charge. The trial court misinterpreted the sentencing guidelines but did not abuse its discretion in imposing an upward departure of five months on the witness tampering charge.</SPAN></P>

At the time of her death, the children's mother was estranged from the maternal grandparents and had made prior allegations of parental abuse against the maternal grandparents.

The court affirmed the grant of visitation to the maternal grandparents, holding that the statute was constitutional. In doing so, the court concluded that strict scrutiny did not apply when the state interfered in parental rights solely for the purpose of facilitating the exercise of the associational rights of another individual. After applying the intermediate level of review, the court held that the state had sufficient interests to justify its direct imposition on parental rights with respect to grandparent visitation and that the distinction between classes of adoptive parents was sufficiently tailored to promote those interests.

Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18a (1996) and a sexually dangerous person (SDP) under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253.02, subd. 18b (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sex offender sexually abused his younger sister. He was charged with first degree criminal sexual conduct and found delinquent. The court ordered out-of-home placement and sex offender treatment. Sex offender sexually molested his sister again while on home visits from a foster placement. The trial court then committed sex offender to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program for an indeterminate period as an SPP and SDP. On appeal, the court found that because sex offender engaged in repeated sexual assaults against his vulnerable, younger sister, the court found that the state met its burden of showing a habitual course of sexual misconduct required for SPP commitment. The court held that the trial court had clear and convincing evidence from which to conclude that sex offender had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses, rendering him dangerous to other persons, as required for SPP commitment. The court found that the evidence supported the trial court's conclusions that sex offender was likely to engage in harmful conduct in the future. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and rejected sex offender's argument that the SDP statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant voluntarily came to transport a friend after the deputy detained the friend for an alcohol related driving offense. Because of department policy, the deputy asked defendant for his identification to verify his identity and to insure he could operate a motor vehicle. He told the deputy that his driver's license was at home. Defendant then complied with the deputy' request for his name and date of birth. After the deputy told defendant that his license was cancelled, defendant admitted that he knew that his license was cancelled years earlier. The court rejected defendant's argument that the request for information was an unconstitutional seizure and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court determined that the fact that defendant went voluntarily to the scene and willingly complied with the deputy' request for identification constituted a consensual encounter involving minimal inquiry and did not constitute a seizure. The court found that a reasonable person in defendant' position would not have felt that they were not free to end the contact with the deputy.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the applicant's negative net worth reflected the result of his past financial activities and that this was a valid ground on which to deny the application. The court found that the applicant had signed a note that was designed to conceal a unlawful loan to an organization licensed to conduct lawful gambling, which constituted a violation of Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion in evidentiary rulings; abused its discretion in upwardly departing from the sentencing guidelines; and erred in requiring him to submit a DNA sample and to register as a sexual offender. The court stated that while in custody, defendant voluntarily surrendered the clothing he wore at the time of the crime. Moreover, defendant failed to offer any evidence that the officers did not provide him with alternative clothing or seized his clothing in a way that caused embarrassment. Under these circumstances, the trial court properly admitted the evidence obtained from the search and seizure of defendant's clothing. The trial court's imposition of a 25-year sentence remained well below the maximum statutory sentence pursuant to Minn. Stat. Ann. &sect; 609.19(2)(1), which provided a maximum sentence of 40 years for a second degree murder conviction. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in making a double upward departure from the sentencing guidelines because severe aggravating factors were present to support the departure.

The court reversed the trial court's finding that the mall was a &quot;public forum.&quot; The free speech guarantee of the federal Bill of Rights did not extend to expressive conduct that occurred within the confines of a privately owned shopping center. Thus, defendant's activity was protected only if the free speech guarantee of the state constitution extended a broader protection than the First Amendment. The court concluded that the state law and the weight of authority in other jurisdictions did not support such an extension. Further, the public funding involved in the development of the mall did not satisfy the state action requirement for the constitutional right to free speech.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the petition and committed the offender for an indeterminate period. He challenged the decision and argued that the State failed to prove he met the standards for commitment and that the SPP and SDP laws were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the gap in time from when the commitment petition was filed and when the offender last engaged in sexual misconduct did not preclude a finding that his actions were habitual. Only his confinement in prison or a hospital caused a cessation of his activity. His conduct caused severe emotional harm to his children and grandchildren and expert testimony supported the conclusion that he had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses. There was a high likelihood that he would engage in the same conduct in the future. His constitutional argument was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

The nursing assistant argued that the decision by the administrative law judge (ALJ), which the Commissioner adopted, was unconstitutional and unsupported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A nursing home resident claimed the nursing assistant forbid her from bringing her wheelchair into the bathroom, refused to give soap to the resident, and washed the resident's private areas in a rough manner. The nursing home issued a vulnerable adult report to the Hennepin County Adult Protection Agency. The Minnesota Department of Health notified the nursing assistant that a finding of abuse would be made a part of her record maintained by the nursing assistant registry. An ALJ found by a preponderance of the evidence that the nursing assistant's behavior constituted abuse. On appeal, the court held the evidence supported the finding of abuse. Although she had a protectable property interest in retaining her employment, 42 C.F.R. &sect; 483.13(c)(ii) (1996) did not violate the nursing assistant's right to due process and equal protection. The government's compelling interest in protecting the public from unsafe or incompetent health care officials outweighed her interest in retaining her employment. The regulation applied equally to all nursing assistants. Simply because it did not apply to every medical professional did not mean that it was an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

The father appealed, challenging &sect; 518.551(1)(b) on equal protection grounds because it allowed differential treatment of child support obligors and on the grounds that the father could not have been required to be imprisoned for a debt. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 518.551(1)(b), on its face, passed constitutional muster because it did not differentiate between father and any other child support obligor and that the trial court properly determined that the statute providing for payment to the county did not unconstitutionally lead to imprisonment for &quot;debt.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The obligor's driver's license was revoked after a hearing before an ALJ based on his failure to pay child support arrearages.

The court found the ALJ's decision to revoke the license was mandatory under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.551(13)(d) (Supp. 1997). The ALJ did not abuse his discretion by proceeding with the default hearing after the obligor's disruptive conduct caused him to be removed from the hearing. Moreover, this court had previously concluded that the obligor's indigence was self-imposed and, thus, did not excuse him from his child support obligations. As to the unheard motions, the ALJ was not authorized to hear those motions and arguments. The limited scope of the hearing was to determine whether the obligor was more than three months in arrears on his child support and whether he had entered into a payment plan for those arrearages. Furthermore, the motions lacked required approval by the appropriate courts.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that the president claimed that he agreed to arrange for adequate employee parking, which was vague and susceptible to differing interpretations, and a reasonable person could have interpreted that to mean free parking. The court concluded that the resident's interpretation was not per se unreasonable and as such, the statements were not actionable. The court determined that the resident was protected by a qualified privilege and did not abuse that privilege by acting with actual malice because he had a legitimate and common interest in the issue of the employees parking on neighborhood streets.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner argued there was no due process violation where defendants' arresting officers accurately summarized the statutory language. Defendants argued that their advisories, which failed to offer an alternative test, were inaccurate, misleading, and threatened them with potential criminal penalties that the state was not authorized to impose. The court reversed and held that the implied consent advisories given to defendants were not inaccurate or misleading, and did not violate their constitutional rights. Both advisories correctly stated that the refusal to take a test was a crime. Moreover, both defendants' rights to counsel were vindicated. The officers were not required to offer an alternative test because defendants agreed to submit to the particular test offered. Due process did not require an implied consent advisory to explain every potentially unclear application of the law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction. On review, the court affirmed because the court found that defendant's conduct constituted solicitation within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.352(2)&nbsp;1996. An analysis of defendant's conduct demonstrated that the trial court's finding that defendant engaged in both verbal and nonverbal conduct in an attempt to seduce the boy was a plausible inference based upon both defendant's words and actions. Bumping into the boy's hip while graphically describing his sexual conduct when he was the same age as the boy was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the solicitation statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent bar brought an action against appellants, city and city officials, in the Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) for monetary damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for an alleged violation of its U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process rights. The bar sought a writ of mandamus to compel the city to accept its liquor license renewal. The trial court denied the appellants' motion for summary judgment. The city officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minnesota Department of Revenue notified the bar that it owed over $ 9,000 in sales taxes, revoked the bar's sales tax permit, and advised the bar that its liquor license would not be renewed until its taxes were paid and it received a tax clearance certificate. A city official informed the bar that its liquor license would not be renewed even if it paid the taxes immediately. Because the bar changed its business identity, another city official advised the bar that it would be required to apply for a new license. The bar did not apply for a new license. The city officials denied that they had deprived the bar of any property rights. The court held that the city officials were entitled to qualified immunity. Because the bar did not submit the required fees, a tax clearance certificate, and proof of insurance with its renewal application, the bar did not have a constitutionally protected property interest in the renewal of its license. Because there was no deprivation of a property interest, the city officials did not violate the bar's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order that denied summary judgment to the city officials in the bar's section 1983 action. The court remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing officer made the decision to terminate by relying primarily upon documents supplied by the Olmsted County Housing and Redevelopment Authority (agency). On the recipient's appeal of that decision, in which she claimed insufficiency of the findings and evidence, the hearing officer submitted a statement of proceedings. The court reversed. The agency by taking evidence and hearing testimony acted in a quasi-judicial capacity which required it to state the facts and conclusions essential to its decision. The hearing officer failed that obligation when he did not mention any testimony or documents that did not support his decision nor provided any explanation of why he disregarded such evidence. Further, the statement of proceedings submitted by the hearing officer was not concurred to by the recipient as required by Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 110.03, and therefore the court refused to consider that statement. Finally, the court found the agency failed to provide substantial evidence for terminating the recipient's benefits because there was no prohibition against having another person stay in her unit provided that person was registered on the benefit voucher.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power utility sought a declaratory judgment that the city's ordinance was invalid and sought to enjoin its enforcement. The trial court concluded that the utility's commission-approved tariffs did not attain the status of general state law, that the ordinance was not preempted by or in conflict with the Minnesota Public Utilities Act (MPUA), Minn. Stat. ch. 216B (1998), and that it was a valid exercise of the city's power. The trial court denied injunctive relief and the utility appealed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city. The court modified the judgment and affirmed. The trial court erred when it determined that the commission-approved tariffs failed to attain the status of general state law due to procedural deficiencies. The MPUA conferred upon municipalities the power to require electric distribution line undergrounding either through a franchise or through reasonable exercise of its police powers. The trial court correctly determined the ordinance was authorized by statute. Requiring electric distribution lines to be placed underground reasonably related to the city's legitimate interest in public safety and the general welfare of its citizenry.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court stated that the two court-appointed examiners used a correct standard to determine whether defendant exhibited the utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses as required for an SPP commitment.  Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02(18a). In so ruling, the court stated that it was proper to consider the nature and frequency of the sexual assaults, the degree of violence involved, the relationship, or lack thereof, between the offender and the victims, the offender's attitude and mood, the offender's medical and family history, the results of psychological and psychiatric testing and evaluation, and other factors that bear on the predatory sex impulse and the lack of power to control it. Further, defendant's conviction of an SDP, Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York corporation terminated its agency with the Minnesota corporation for the sale of merchandise. The Minnesota corporation successfully petitioned for arbitration of unpaid sales commissions.

The court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 325E.37 plainly authorized the payment of commissions that were due as well as damages for breach of contract. The court ruled that it was immaterial whether it agreed with the arbitrator's computations because it constituted an error of fact. The court also found that the MSRA treated in-state and out-of-state manufacturers the same with respect to termination of covered agreements with sales representatives. The court reasoned that the MSRA regulated the termination of covered agreements, not the free flow of interstate goods.

On appeal, the court affirmed the Commissioner's decision. The Commissioner did not err when he failed to review the audio tape of the contested case hearing. Although the transcript of a contested case hearing was required to be included in the record, no transcript was made of the applicant's hearing. Minn. R. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convicted sex offender challenged the decision of the Rice County District Court (Minnesota) that granted the motion for summary judgment filed by respondent Commissioner of Corrections. The convicted sex offender sought injunctive relief and a declaration that the requirement to register as a predatory offender, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166, subd. (1)(a), was improper and violated his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convicted sex offender was charged with third-degree felony criminal sexual conduct, fifth-degree assault, and third-degree assault. He pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and prior to his release, was required to register as a predatory offender, pursuant to &sect; 243.166, subd. 1(a)(1). In the subsequent action challenging the constitutionality of the requirement, the district court granted the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the legislature intended that offenders charged with predatory offenses listed in &sect; 243.166, subd. 1(a)(1), but convicted of lesser offenses that arose out of the same set of circumstance, were subject to the registration requirement. Because the convicted sex offender pleaded guilty to a crime that arose out of the same set of circumstances as the crimes charged, he was subject to the registration provision. The court also rejected the convicted sex offender's constitutional claims that the section violated his rights to due process, the prohibition against bills of attainder, and the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a pretrial order of the Freeborn County District Court (Minnesota) that granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence on the ground that it was illegally obtained. Defendant was charged with five felony counts relating to the illegal possession and distribution of methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers were observing the delivery to a home of a package that they knew had contained methamphetamine. They saw defendant park nearby, pick up the package, leave the home carrying a bag large enough to hold the package, and drive away. An officer stopped defendant's car and told her that she was a suspect in a drug investigation. She was taken to a police station, where she was placed under arrest. A detective who entered her car to prepare it for towing saw the bag she had been carrying. The trial court found that defendant's car was lawfully stopped but that she was not under arrest at the time of the search and that the seizure of the bag from the car was unlawful. The court reversed. The determination whether defendant was under arrest at the time of the search was objective, not subjective. The trial court erred in holding that she was not under arrest because a reasonable person would not have concluded that she was free to go. The search of the vehicle was supported by probable cause because the stop was lawful. The suppressed evidence had a critical impact on the trial because it was the only evidence of defendant's involvement in the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The action was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adversary argued the trial court erred in concluding his conduct constituted harassment because he did not adversely affect the safety, security, or privacy of another. The court pointed out that the harassment restraining order could be issued if the trial court found reasonable grounds to believe the adversary had engaged in harassment as defined by Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.748, subd. 1(a)(1) (1996). The record demonstrated that the adversary had a gun permit; he regularly attends school board meetings and wrote numerous letters to the superintendent concerning issues of curriculum; the adversary had appeared at the superintendent's home; and the letters spoke in terms of &quot;warfare&quot; and contain charged, threatening language. The court could not say the trial court's determination that the adversary's words and conduct constituted harassment of the superintendent was clearly erroneous. Furthermore, the trial court's narrowly drawn restrains that required the adversary to remain 15 feet away from the superintendent and prohibits any &quot;unfettered contact&quot; did not impose an unconstitutional restraint on the adversary.</SPAN></P>

The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) granted summary judgment for the manufacturer, finding that the insurer's claims were barred by the economic loss doctrine, Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer paid its insureds for damage to their van that was destroyed by a fire. Subsequently, the insureds received a recall notice from the manufacturer advising them of a defect that could cause a fire. The insurer, asserting its subrogation rights, brought its suit against the manufacturer. The appellate court held that the economic loss doctrine, Minn. Stat. &sect; 604.10(c) (1996), barred the insurer's claims. The court found that the economic loss doctrine applied to consumers as well as businesses in actions for loss of the product itself. The court held that the insurer's general assertions of fraudulent concealment by the manufacturer were speculation and conjecture and insufficient as a matter of law to avoid summary judgment. The court concluded that Minn. Stat. &sect; 336.2-735 (1996), containing a four-year statute of limitations, was constitutional even though it barred a claim before its discovery.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper participated in a group sexual encounter at a hotel while attending a state-paid training session. The incident became widely known and the arrests that ensued attracted immediate and substantial negative publicity. The state discharged the state trooper. The association sought arbitration on his behalf. While the matter was pending, a court acquitted the state trooper of criminal charges. The arbitrator found that the state trooper violated his oath to conduct himself at all times in accordance with the highest moral standards and to avoid committing any act that would reflect discredit on the state patrol. The arbitrator found that the state had just cause for discipline, but that reinstatement without pay for the period of suspension was the appropriate sanction. The court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the arbitrator adopted a reasonable interpretation of &quot;just cause&quot; in the agreement allowing disciplinary action; (2) the state had a compelling interest in regulating the state trooper's conduct that overrode the state trooper's privacy interests; and (3) the state trooper's conduct warranted the disciplinary action that the arbitrator imposed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 297D.12, subd. 2 (1988) barred the taxpayer's declaratory judgment action claiming that Minnesota's controlled substance tax was unconstitutional because it placed him twice in jeopardy for the same offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was found guilty of possession of a controlled substance and failure to affix drug stamps, and was sentenced to prison. The Commissioner sent a notice of assessment of marijuana and controlled substance tax pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 297.12 , subd. 1 (1988), Minn. Stat. &sect; 270.70 (1988), and Minn. Stat. &sect; 297.09 (1988). The court found that &quot;established statutory procedures&quot; already provided the taxpayer with two options for appealing the tax assessment. First, he could have withheld payment of the disputed tax and appealed to the Minnesota Tax Court. Second, he could have paid the tax and brought suit in district court for a refund. The availability of those options supplanted the injunctive and declaratory relief which the taxpayer sought. However, the taxpayer claimed that neither of the two remedies provided an adequate remedy in his situation because neither could properly address the constitutionality issue at hand. The court found that the taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of the tax statute as applied to him. He did not challenge the constitutionality of the tax statute on its face. The exception, therefore, did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his commitment hearing, appellant admitted he had sexually abused boys beginning at least 25 years previously. Evidence indicated his victims suffered serious emotional and mental harm, that he suffered from paraphilia and a personality disorder, that he displayed an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses, and that he was highly likely to reoffend. On appeal, he claimed that the district court erred when it held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.07, subd. 7(a) (1996) did not require a probable cause determination as to the merits of the commitment in the preliminary hold hearing, and when it did not make findings as to alternatives less restrictive than commitment to the Minnesota Sexual Psychopathic Personality Treatment Center. Appellant also asserted that the SDP law was unconstitutional. The court rejected these arguments and affirmed. The court held that a probable cause determination was not required and that the district court's findings were sufficient and supported its conclusion that placement at the Minnesota Sexual Psychopathic Personality Treatment Center was the least restrictive alternative placement.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile made incriminating statements both before and after the Miranda warning was given, and the trial court ordered the statements suppressed. The state appealed, arguing that the pre-Miranda questioning was not intended to elicit incriminating responses and that the post-Miranda responses were voluntary given. The court held that because the juvenile was in custody during the police interrogation, he was entitled to Miranda warnings after being questioned by the police. The court also stated that the juvenile's statements made after Miranda warnings were given were not voluntarily made and were also inadmissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police, who were responding to a call from a hotel to remove guests who were excessively noisy, smelled marijuana when the occupants opened the room's door; the police informed all seven guests that they were under arrest for suspicion of possession of marijuana. In response to an officer's inquiry, defendant gave a false name. A search revealed a small amount of marijuana, seven &quot;rocks&quot; of cocaine in a comforter, and two more &quot;rocks&quot; in a baseball cap belonging to defendant. As a consequence of suppressing the evidence in defendant's case, the district court found that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest defendant and dismissed the charge against him. On appeal, the court held that the State failed to meet its burden of showing clear and unequivocal error. The officers did not arrest defendant for giving a false name, and any marijuana smell could have come from any of the room's occupant. The officers had little, if any, evidence when they first entered the room and before the search that anyone in the room possessed more than a small amount of marijuana, and that evidence did not point to defendant. The police lacked probable cause to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During his time in jail for a felony conviction, respondent signed a probation agreement indicating that his home was subject to search by the Minnesota Department of Corrections. A detective told respondent's probation officer that an informant had indicated that respondent had a gun; accordingly, the officer and the detective searched respondent's apartment and seized an assault rifle and other contraband. The trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress the evidence seized, holding that the search of his apartment was illegal because the officer failed to confirm the information he received from the detective and because he asked the detective to participate in the search. The court reversed, holding that the trial court erred by requiring the officer to verify the detective's tip before conducting the search; this improperly required the officer to establish probable cause, rather than reasonable cause, for the search. Furthermore, the mere fact that the detective accompanied the probation officer in conducting the search did not render it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition to commit the individual as an SDP was filed by a state correctional facility official. The individual admitted that he had had sexual contact with many young male victims. Psychologists diagnosed the individual with pedophilia, and schizoid and avoidance personality traits. The trial court committed the individual as an SDP for an indeterminate period. The court affirmed the order and held that the determination that the individual posed a substantial likelihood of causing serious emotional harm was sufficient to have met the statutory standard because the statute required a showing of the likelihood of either serious physical or emotional harm, but did not require both. There was clear and convincing evidence that a substantial likelihood existed that the victims suffered serious emotional harm based on expert testimony and victim interviews. In finding clear and convincing evidence that the individual was highly likely to engage in harmful sexual conduct if released without intensive treatment in a structured environment, the trial court cited the individual's past conduct, treatment failures, lack of victim empathy, and his number of sex offense-related deficits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was represented in his direct appeal of his assault and burglary convictions by the state public defender. Petitioner argued that he was entitled to state public defender assistance in his postconviction hearing and that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The court disagreed with both arguments. The language of Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.05 (1991) was clear that where a state public defender provided representation in a direct appeal, the public defender could, but was not required to, provide counsel to an indigent petitioner in a later postconviction proceeding. The public defender was only required to provide an indigent petitioner with postconviction counsel if a petitioner did not receive such representation on direct appeal, and petitioner had received such representation. Petitioner's counsel on direct appeal was not ineffective for failing to include all possible claims. His appellate counsel was also not ineffective for failing to investigate an alleged claim of juror misconduct. Defense lawyers were not permitted to initiate contact with jurors, and the juror who had possible information of misconduct had not timely contacted the appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the decision of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) convicting defendant of both felonies, three gross misdemeanors, and the misdemeanor violation of the restraining order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fired private counsel after he was unable to negotiate an acceptable plea bargain. Three weeks before trial, the public defender determined defendant was ineligible for court-appointed counsel. Defendant proceeded to trial pro se without standby counsel. Defendant argued that reversal was required on all counts because the trial court failed to appoint counsel for him. Defendant also contended that five of the jury instructions regarding stalking were fatally defective because they failed to require specific intent. The court held that in considering defendant's debts, assets, and possible income, the trial court properly found defendant financially able to afford counsel without substantial hardship. The court also held that after defendant was convicted and sentenced, the Minnesota Supreme Court determined that specific intent was an element of the stalking statute and this determination applied retroactively. The court concluded that because the instructions here did not &quot;explain the law of the case,&quot; and in fact contained a fundamental error of law, a new trial was required on the stalking charges..</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of second-degree attempted murder, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and kidnapping of a 13-year-old girl. Appellant engaged in various treatment programs and as part of his treatment, appellant disclosed that he had molested six children who attended day care in his mother's home, and that he engaged in numerous inappropriate sexual conduct with children and women. In anticipation of appellant's release from prison, a petition for commitment as a sexually dangerous person was filed pursuant to &sect; 253B.02. A hearing was held and the trial court found all the necessary elements. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that the record showed that appellant himself testified as to his deviant sexual conduct with children and women. The court noted that appellant did not present any evidence showing that the testimony was in violation of any privilege and, hence, not admissible. In addition, the trial court had testimony from expert witnesses who testified that although appellant participated in certain programs, he was not remorseful and did not have an opportunity to apply what he learned. The experts indicated that appellant would re-offend.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 253B.02 (1996) and committed him for an indeterminate period. He challenged every element of the SDP commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately two years after he had been released on parole for criminal sexual conduct, defendant was again convicted of criminal sexual conduct. The court affirmed his commitment as a SDP. The court noted that the district court took a different view of the crimes from defendant's contentions that the victims were not harmed. The court noted that the district court had received evidence that defendant had engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct that had created a substantial likelihood of serious physical or emotional harm. The court determined that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the district court's decision in this regard. In its determination of the likelihood of future harm, factors the district court considered included the demographics, the person's history of violent behavior, base rate statistics, sources of stress in the person's environment, the similarity of the present or future context to those in which the person has used violence in the past, and sex therapy treatment success. The court held that the district court's conclusion that defendant met the standards for an SDP commitment was supported by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. First, the court held that the officer's act of covering appellant's braids in a photo array was not unduly suggestive. The court noted that another individual in the array had braids and that the witnesses had ample opportunity to observe appellant during and after the robbery. Second, the court held that the prior conviction was properly admitted although the conviction was also for robbery. The conviction was recent and the importance of appellant's testimony was diminished because of his theory of the case. Third, the court held that in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury's verdict of guilty, an appellate court examined the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. The record showed that there were two eyewitnesses to the robbery who identified appellant. The fact that appellant presented an alibi witness was an issue of credibility for the jury to resolve.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped the driver because he believed that the rear license plate of the driver's truck was not properly illuminated as required under Minn.

The trial court sustained the revocation. The driver appealed, contending that the revocation of his license under the implied consent law was improper because the officer conducted an unconstitutional investigatory stop. The court agreed with the trial court's determination at the implied consent hearing that the officer conducted a proper investigative stop based upon the evidence. The trial court's determination regarding the credibility of the officer's testimony with respect to the investigative stop was to be given due regard under Minn. R. Civ. P. 52.01. Additionally, from the officer's testimony, the trial court could properly conclude that the stop was based upon a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the driver was driving in violation of the traffic laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife divorced, and a consensual special magistrate was appointed to determine the issue of child support. After the magistrate issued his order concerning the husband's child support obligation, the husband appealed, arguing that the child support award was excessive and without support in the record. In affirming, the court concluded that if it was determined that the husband was voluntarily underemployed, child support could properly be calculated based upon a determination of his imputed income, by which the district court estimated the husband's earning ability. The husband billed approximately six hours per week in his law practice, whereas approximately 30 billed hours per week was the average in his area of law. The magistrate imputed income to the husband based upon his prior earnings and his plans for pursuing a private law practice. The magistrate's finding that the husband was voluntarily underemployed was not clearly erroneous, and the magistrate did not abuse his discretion in calculating the husband's child support obligation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contestants practiced religions that recognized Saturday as the Sabbath. They complained that the Minn. Stat. &sect; 168.275, which banned on the sale of motor vehicles on Sunday, violated their constitutional rights. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the state, county, and association. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that the contestant who lost a day's work because she had to shop for a car on a weekday lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 168.275. The only burden she alleged was inconvenience. The court concluded that the contestant who was a car dealer had standing because he claimed a direct economic loss resulting from his inability to personally keep his business open six days a week. The court ruled that the contestant's free exercise of religion was not violated because &sect; 168.275 did not prohibit or make unlawful the contestant's religious practices. The court ruled that the Establishment Clause was not violated because the legislative purpose behind &sect; 168.275 was to bring uniformity to dealer sales of motor vehicles on Sunday.

Appellant also argued that the trial court erred by imposing prosecution cost. The court affirmed. First, the court held that the reference to county judge in the statute was obsolete because district judges now served all counties and, therefore, any court having jurisdiction could issue a warrant. Second, the court held that even if the officers failed to hand appellant the search warrant and failed to announce themselves, the violations were at most technical and did not warrant suppression of the evidence. The court noted that the trial court was the trier of fact and was free to believe the officers' version of the facts. Lastly, the court held that the prosecution costs statute, like the fines statute, did not require a finding of ability to pay. Minn. Stat. &sect; 631.48 (1996).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault on a child and criminal sexual assault over a 30-year period. The abuse included masturbation, intercourse, digital penetration, fellatio, and cunnilingus, as well as more bizarre sexual practices. Defendant was diagnosed with pedophilia, other paraphernalia, and a personality order. Two of three experts concluded that defendant met the standards for commitment as a sexual psychopathic person and as a sexually dangerous person. The district court made an indeterminate commitment of defendant as a sexual psychopathic personality and sexually dangerous person. On appeal, defendant contended that his commitment was unconstitutional, he was not found mentally ill, as allegedly required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 17 (1996), and he was not committed to the least restrictive alternative. The court held that the defendant's commitment was not unconstitutional, that the statute did not require a finding that he was mentally ill, and that the commitment was based on clear and convincing evidence and was not clearly erroneous. The court noted that the indeterminate commitments did not violate substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator had premises permits to conduct lawful gambling at two establishments. After a special agent discovered video game machines, or &quot;gambling devices&quot; within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.75, subds. 4, 8 (1994), the possession of which was illegal gambling pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.755 (1994), the Board imposed a 90-day suspension of relator's premises permits. The court upheld the suspension, concluding that neither Minn. R. 7861.0050, subpt. 1 (1995) nor the Board's enforcement of it deprived relator of due process. Prior to 1995, Rule 7861.0050 provided for a harsher penalty, namely, a year's suspension for any violation. That harsher version of the rule was held not to violate substantive due process. If the harsher penalty had not violated due process, it was only logical to conclude that the current rule did not do so. The reduction in penalty from one year to 90 days took into account that some organizations, like relator, were not culpable and might not have been aware that illegal gambling was being conducted on their premises. Nonetheless, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.755 (1994) provided that possession itself, regardless of use, was a violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petition was filed to commit the sexual offender as a sexual psychopathic personality (SPP) and a sexually dangerous person (SDP). The district court entered an order committing him as charged. Pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.18, subd. 2 (1996), the district court held a 60-day review hearing and found clear and convincing evidence that the sexual offender continued to meet the definitions of SPP and SDP and that his current facility was best suited to meet his needs. The sexual offender appealed, but the court affirmed the district court's decision. Given his inability to control his sexual impulses, his diagnosed pedophilia, fetishism, dysthymia, antisocial personality disorder, five offenses of criminal sexual conduct, and high likelihood of reoffense, the sexual offender met the criteria of SPP and SDP. It was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that indeterminate commitment was the least restrictive alternative that met the sexual offender's needs and provided adequate protection for society. Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (1996) did not violate his substantive due process rights or his rights against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of importing cocaine across state borders. He was sentenced to 54 months in prison. On appeal, defendant contended that the arresting officers did not have reasonable suspicion to support their investigative stop of him at an airport. Defendant further contended that the trial court should have excluded all evidence obtained as a result of the stop. The court found that almost all of the factors relied upon by the arresting officers for the investigatory stop were consistent with completely innocent conduct. Many airline passengers checked luggage of the type checked by defendant. There was also nothing unusual about defendant pacing in the baggage claim area. Defendant did not use an alias, and there was no reason for the officers to believe that he was traveling under an assumed name.

Respondent later petitioned the postconviction court for relief and argued that a recent decision, when applied to the facts of his case, made the stop illegal. In that decision, it was stated that a stop based on the suspended driver's license of the owner of a vehicle was improper if the officer had actual knowledge that the driver was not the owner of the vehicle. The postconviction court agreed and vacated respondent's conviction. The State appealed. The court noted that claims raised on direct appeal would not be considered in a petition for postconviction relief. The court held that there was no new rule of criminal procedure established that might be applied retroactively, because the decision explicitly relied on existing caselaw.

The court rejected that argument, observing that pro se defendants were required to comply with the rules of procedure that applied to all litigants. Moreover, even if the court were to consider defendant's claims of evidentiary errors and prosecutorial misconduct, the claims lacked merit. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was properly brought and addressed in a petition for postconviction relief, but the court determined that counsel's tactical decisions were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court continued defendant's probation for a prior conspiracy offense for 10 years from the sentencing hearing date, but executed a 60-month sentence for that offense to run during the probationary term. Ten days after sentencing, the trial court recognized that the probation revocation sentence was improper because it executed part of the sentence while extending probation for the same offense. The district court resentenced defendant to a 120-month executed sentence for the conspiracy conviction. Defendant claimed that the correction of his sentence amounted to an unconstitutional increase of his period of confinement. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in correcting defendant's sentence. The corrected sentence did not violate double jeopardy principles because it did not increase the original sentence. By correcting defendant's sentence, the trial court did not violate Minn. R. Crim. P. 27.03, subd. 9, under which it might correct an unlawful sentence at any time. The trial court corrected the sentence within 10 days of its initial decision, before defendant was committed to the Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>

The agency did not abuse its discretion in entering summary disposition after considering tapes of the city council meeting provided by the city, despite the speaker's challenge to the authenticity of the tapes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in its jury instructions by not instructing that specific intent to harass was required. The jury instructions given by the trial court followed a prior decision of the court and thus, did not state that an element of harassment was that defendant's actions were committed with the specific intent to harass. After defendant was sentenced, the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed the court's prior decision and held that specific intent was required for a harassment conviction. On appeal, the State contended that the superceding decision should only have been prospectively applied and that because defendant was convicted before the such decision, it was inapplicable to his case. The court held that the new rule regarding the specific intent to harass element did apply to defendant's case because the superceding decision was not announcing a new rule, but rather, was overruling a prior decision correcting an error in the interpretation of a statute. In such cases, the decision of a court of supreme jurisdiction overruling a former decision was retrospective in its operation.</SPAN></P>

The corporation was awarded damages based on the trial court's conclusion that the City had selectively enforced the ordinance against the corporation. The court reversed the damages award. The court ruled that the trial court erred in deciding the constitutionality of the ordinances because the City did not properly plead the action to challenge the constitutionality of the City's sign ordinances, and the City had authority to prohibit the corporation's signs based solely on the conditions of a conditional use permit. The court held that the evidence did not support a claim of selective enforcement. The court found that the City was acting to enforce the conditions of a conditional use permit, which were not being challenged; therefore the constitutionality of the sign ordinances was not properly before the trial court.

The motion for sanctions was denied. The court held that (1) the judgment of dismissal was a partial judgment because the builder's motion for sanctions was pending when the judgment was entered but the court agreed to hear the entire case for reasons of judicial economy; (2) the district court did not err in denying the builder's request for sanctions or in doing so without making a specific finding of fact; (3) the builder was not unconstitutionally denied an opportunity to conduct discovery; and (4) because the builder's argument as to mandamus was made for the first time in the reply brief, it was properly stricken.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fled in response and spat out drugs concealed in his mouth. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of a third degree controlled substance offense. On appeal, he urged that the search was unconstitutional. The court noted that the officer's order to defendant to open his mouth constituted a seizure. However, the court ruled that the seizure was reasonable because it was supported by the officer's suspicious and defendant's close-mouthed response and clenched neck muscles. However, the court held that no search occurred because defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the fact that his mouth was so crammed with an illegal substance that he was not even able to talk.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of two counts of criminal sexual assault and two counts of kidnapping and was sentenced to a 20-year term. Petitioner sought post-conviction relief, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that the prosecutor's conduct was prejudicial. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the reviewing court was required to determine whether sufficient evidence existed to support the lower court's findings. The district court would not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. In order to show constitutionally inadequate performance by an attorney, petitioner must allege facts that would affirmatively prove that his counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. The court held that petitioner did not allege any facts because which witnesses to call and what evidence to present to the jury were matters of trial strategy. Lastly, the prosecutor's statements in closing argument were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the landowner purchased the disputed land, he was aware that the land was unbuildable because of the city's zoning ordinances, and that a variance would be required. The city twice denied the landowner's request for a variance based on the landowner's knowledge of the ordinances when he purchased the land. The landowner filed suit, seeking a writ of mandamus ordering the city either to issue the variance or to commence condemnation proceedings. In reversing the trial court's decision with respect to the denial of the variance, the court held that actual or constructive knowledge of a zoning ordinance before a purchase of land was not a bar to granting a variance. The court remanded the matter to the city council for reconsideration of the landowner's application. In affirming the grant of summary judgment in the city's favor on the taking issue, the court held that the fact that the landowner knew at the time of purchase that the property was subject to a zoning restriction was a sufficient basis to reject his claim of an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club was temporarily closed under Ordinance 1545, which did not prohibit nudity but placed reasonable locational restrictions on adult cabarets. Ordinance 1551 addressed the amortization for nonconforming adult uses. The bookstore and the club brought a declaratory judgment action against the city to declare the ordinances unconstitutional, seeking an injunction to prevent enforcement of Ordinance 1551 against the bookstore and damages for the club. After the trial court entered the special verdict for the city and denied appellants' motion for a new trial, the bookstore and the club appealed. Reversing to vacate Ordinance 1551, the court said that it was enacted without statutory authority. Affirming the denial of the motion, the court upheld the constitutionality of Ordinance 1545. The court agreed with the trial court that the ordinance was tailored to apply only to adult uses that would have produced unwanted secondary effects. It was not overbroad. The court did not disturb the jury finding that the club suffered no damages and the trial court's rejection of the club's claim that it proved damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court entered a judgment dissolving the 10-year marriage of a couple with a two-year-old child. The husband, on appeal, argued that the &quot;irretrievable breakdown&quot; or no-fault standard set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.06, subd. 1, was unconstitutional because, where there were minor children of the marriage, it did not serve the purpose of the federal constitution as expressed in the Preamble. Moreover, the husband claimed, the no-fault threshold was unconstitutional because it did not provide equal protection of the law as required by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Given the husband's failure to notify the attorney general of his attack on the statute's constitutionality, the court explained that it needed only to address the constitutionality of the statute as applied. Because the husband's constitutional purpose argument was not presented or addressed by the trial court, the court declined to address the issue. As for the husband's equal protection argument, the court noted that he made no legal argument to support his position. Thus, the court concluded, the husband waived the constitutional issue he reserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant of first-degree assault. The trial court imposed a 120-month sentence, representing a 34-month upward departure from the 86-month presumptive sentence. Appellant challenged his conviction, asserting that the out-of-court identification was unduly suggestive, that the prosecutorial misconduct warranted a mistrial, and that his sentence was excessive. The court affirmed. First, the court held that, because appellant did not raise the identification issue at the trial level, the issue was not preserved for review. Nonetheless, the court noted that the victim had ample opportunity to identify appellant and identified appellant by name at the hospital. Second, the court held that the prosecutor's misstatements about the burden of proof and other statements were not so unusually serious as to warrant a mistrial. There was no evidence that the statements were intentional, and appellant failed to show that he was prejudiced. Third, the court held that departure from the sentencing guidelines was proper because of the existence of aggravating factors, including the fact that the crime occurred in the victim's home and appellant used a bat to commit the crime.</SPAN></P>

He admitted that he rode into the crowd in an effort to disperse it and that he had swung a lead rope, knocking down one of the group's' signs. He was charged with felony harassment. He sought dismissal of the charge, asserting that the harassment statute was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed holding that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.749, subds. 2(7), 3(1) (1996), was unconstitutionally vague and that the felony enhancement provision of &sect; 609.749, subd. 3(1), making bias-motivated harassment a felony, was overbroad. The court reversed. The statute required specific intent and defendant's actions clearly satisfied the statute's intent component. Therefore, the statute was not overly vague as applied to defendant. And it was not overbroad. The statute's prohibition was of activities that could be likened to &quot;fighting words,&quot; and such prohibitions were constitutional. And, because the statute did not define harassing conduct in terms of its bias motivation but only used bias to enhance the statute's penalty to the felony level, the felony enhancement was not unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The protester argued that the hunter harassment act, Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.037 (1994), was a content-based restriction of his free speech, the county lacked jurisdiction to enforce the trespass ordinance, and the ordinance discriminated against nonhunters. In affirming the conviction, the court found that &sect; 97A.037 was not unconstitutional. The protester, acting with intent, disturbed others who were taking, or preparing to take, a wild animal. Further, the protester could not raise the argument of jurisdiction on appeal because he did not raise it before the trial court. Even if considered, the argument failed because there was a joint powers agreement between the county and the park district. If the protester's arrest was beyond the scope of the county's agreement with the park district, the appropriate remedy was suppression of evidence, not a dismissal of the charges. Finally, the protester failed to raise the issue of the ordinance discriminating against nonhunters before the trial court; therefore, it could not be considered on appeal. Nevertheless, there was no proof that the ordinance had no substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.</SPAN></P>

Testimony showed that dogs were the number one complaint at city hall and that the mayor initiated the ordinance to address problems with dog noise and dog odor. It was at least debatable that limiting the number of dogs per residential unit was substantially related to controlling the problems of dog noise and odor, or to the health and general welfare of the community as affected by dogs. There was a rational relationship between the ordinance and solving the problems caused by dogs. The dog owners failed to prove the ordinances were unreasonable.

When they began their business, there was no dog limitation ordinance in effect. On appeal, defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional or, alternatively, that defendant's business was valid as both a nonconforming use and a home occupation. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that the ordinance was presumptively constitutional. The court reasoned that defendant failed to offer evidence that regulating the number of dogs was unrelated to controlling the problems of dog noise and odor as they affected the health and general welfare of the community and, therefore, defendant failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality. The court found defendant's business could not be considered a nonconforming use because that term applied only in the zoning law context. Moreover, the court found that it was irrelevant whether defendant's business was a valid home occupation under Little Canada, Minn., Mun. Code &sect; 903.120 (1995) because the business remained violative of the dog limitation ordinance.</SPAN></P>

His sentence on the misdemeanor was stayed on various conditions. Before the hearing at which defendant pled guilty to the misdemeanor charge, the prosecutor contacted felony investigators because the girlfriend had reported two more phone calls from defendant. The prosecutor did not disclose that to defendant or his attorney before defendant pled guilty. Defendant claimed that (1) his due process rights were violated because he was not notified of the felony investigation; double jeopardy barred the felony prosecution after he had been convicted of the predicate misdemeanor offense; and (3) &sect; 609.749, subd. 5(b) was vague. On appeal, the court held that due process did not require that defendant be notified, prior to pleading guilty to the misdemeanor offense, of the pending felony investigation, and double jeopardy did not bar a prosecution for felony harassment after defendant was convicted of the predicate misdemeanor offense. However, the court vacated the conviction because the felony harassment statute required a finding of specific intent.</SPAN></P>

The tribe performed under the contract until it created its own tribal court and later began construction on its own motel. The developer sued and the tribe moved to dismiss on the grounds of sovereign immunity, invalid consent to jurisdiction, and the doctrine of comity. The district court held that it had jurisdiction and the tribe appealed the declaration of jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motorist was charged with drunk driving after a police officer noticed him drunk behind the wheel of a parked car having its engine running. Appellee state commissioner revoked appellant's driving privileges owing to this arrest and ordered his license plates impounded. On appellant's petition for review, a judge held that the suspension was proper, inasmuch as the was stop was proper and appellant was a recidivist drunk driver. Appellant then took an appeal. The court affirmed. It held that, insofar as the stop was concerned, there was no stop until the officer observed appellant in the driver's seat of his vehicle, obviously drunk. Prior to that time, the officer had not stopped the vehicle; it was stopped on its own. As to the impoundment of appellant's license plates, the court agreed with the conclusion that appellant had prior violations of the drunk driving law, even though he had not been previously convicted, because a &quot;violation&quot; was defined as including the improper refusal to take a breathalyzer or other similar test (which appellant had in the past refused to take). The court also rejected appellant's ex post facto argument, citing precedent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The motorist was not stopped improperly by the police where he had been observed drunk in the drivers seat of a vehicle in which the engine was running, and his refusal to take a breathalyzer test constituted a violation of the implied consent laws, thereby authorizing the administrative actions taken against him.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld defendant's conviction because he failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute violated his rights to travel and due process. The court held that the statute did not implicate the right to travel because merely regulated one mode of transportation, driving a motor vehicle, and was narrowly tailored to advance the significant public interest of having insured drivers to efficiently compensate accident victims. The court held that defendant did not belong to the class affected by the statute because he could afford to pay premiums.

In affirming the conviction, the court found that the stop of the cab was justified based on the cab's violation of a traffic ordinance. Further, as a basis for the stop of the cab independent of the traffic violation, there was reasonable suspicion based on a tip from an informant that drug dealing was taking place at the house, the officers' observations of the house in corroboration of the tip, the officers' belief that activities at the house indicated drug dealing, and one officer's experience with over 200 drug-related arrests. Those specific and articulable facts created reasonable suspicion that a narcotics law had been violated. The officers' failure to cite the cab driver did not taint the legitimacy of the stop. The driver, while responsible for the traffic violation, had nothing to do with the narcotics activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court determined that the amendment's setback and animal unit requirements were not supported by any rational basis that related to promoting the public welfare and that the amendment's valid sections were not severable. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, concluding that the property owner demonstrated that the board adopted the amendment without referring to any data that showed that the setback and animal unit numbers related to controlling odor or to preserving property values. The court also rejected the Board's argument that it could have relied on its members' experience to support the challenged figures, noting that there was no evidence that the members' experiences affected the standards that were adopted and that relaxing the requirement for findings based on expert opinions or other evidence had to be narrowly construed. The court further determined that applying the county setback and animal unit requirements for residential districts to primarily agricultural land was inconsistent with the township's plan and that the invalid provisions were not severable because they were needed in order to execute the amendment's remaining provisions.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the summary judgment in favor of respondent Commissioner of Corrections and the State of Minnesota and the determination that the registration requirement of Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166 (1996) did not violate his Alford plea and that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the judgment, the court found that there was no error in holding a separate hearing on the State's summary judgment motion after defendant's summary judgment motion was denied. Further, defendant did not specify which statements from the discovery materials presented genuine issues of material fact that rendered summary judgment improper. In addition, the law required a finding of an adequate factual basis for an Alford plea. The factual basis went to the evidence against defendant and the high probability that he would be convicted because of it. Also, Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166 (1996), the registration statute, did not interfere with defendant's right to privacy. His conviction was a matter of public record regardless of the registration, and the registration information was private data that could be used for law enforcement purposes only. Neither did the requirement that defendant give prior written notice before he changed his residence restrain his freedom of movement. Finally, because defendant did not state which of his First Amendment rights was impaired, the argument that &sect; 243.166 was overbroad was rejected.</SPAN></P>

Defendant stated that a woman who worked at a nearby shopping mall was holding the cocaine, and arrangements were made to meet there that afternoon. There was no purchase of cocaine, nor did the officer see or talk with the woman. Defendant was charged with two counts of cocaine sale and two counts of conspiracy to sell cocaine. At a pretrial conference, he filed a motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause. The district court dismissed all four charges. The State filed an appeal, contending that the dismissal was based on a legal determination and that the court failed to consider all the evidence presented. On appeal, the court held that the State attempted to create a legal issue where none existed. The court found that there was no evidence that the district court required possession to show conspiracy. The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the charges of sale or conspiracy to sell, and that the trial court made a factual determination that the conversation did not rise to the level of an overt act in furtherance of the goal of a cocaine sale.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had granted the hauling company's motion on the ground that the processing company's fee scheme discriminated against interstate commerce and did not use the least onerous means to advance a legitimate local interest. On appeal, the processing company argued that its fee scheme was constitutional because it did not discriminate against interstate commerce and because its benefits outweighed any claimed burden on interstate commerce. In affirming, the court held that the processing company's fee scheme was discriminatory and that the processing company could have used less onerous alternatives to promote the interests advanced by its fee scheme.

The district court denied the final accounting and proposed settlement and decree and again ordered the sale of the homestead. The representative argued that the claims were a &quot;lien or charge&quot; which could not be enforced in probate court but only in district court, and that the probate division of the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction. The court disagreed, holding that there was no district court which was not also a probate court, and no distinction between the courts. The court held that Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded as a matter of law that the statutory notice provisions were not violated; the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children violation did not warrant vacation of the adoption decree; and the failure to identify the biological father, who was not entitled to notice of the proceedings, did not constitute fraud upon the court. The biological father's untimely paternity claim in New Hampshire, unaccompanied by any attempt in Minnesota to file an affidavit of his intention to retain his parental rights, did not constitute substantial compliance with the affidavit requirement of Minn. Stat. &sect; 259.51(1) (1994), and did not entitle him to receive notice of his son's adoption proceedings. The failure of the birth mother and the adoptive parents to notify the Minnesota Department of Human Services of their intent to bring the child to Minnesota for the purpose of adoption violated the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children; but the unknowing violation did not provide an adequate basis for vacating the decree. The nondisclosure of the alleged biological father's identity to the district court did not result in fraud upon the court.</SPAN></P>

Ten years later, the mother renewed her efforts to collect child support, and a judgment representing child support arrearages was entered against the father. The father moved to vacate the judgment and the matter was referred to the ALJ. On appeal, the mother argued that the ALJ misapplied the law in vacating the judgment. The court held that the ALJ improperly considered the delay in collecting child support and the mother's representations regarding parental status in vacating the judgment. The father knew and had constructive notice that his parental rights had not been terminated. The ALJ's finding of interference with visitation did not constitute a defense to nonpayment of support pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.612 (1996). The court noted that the purpose of the support was to ensure financial support for the child for present and future anticipated expenses. The court concluded that the ALJ abused its discretion in vacating the child support judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.037 may not constitutionally be applied to a person whose only intent was to dissuade the taking of a wild animal or enjoyment of the out-of-doors because, when so applied, its purpose was related to the content of expression. The provision of Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.037 relating to an intent to dissuade restricted the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment and was invalid. However, the remaining provision of the state were severable, were not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague, and did not constitute an invalid time, place, and manner restriction of protected expression. The statute furthered the important government interest in regulating the taking of wild animals and protecting the rights of persons to hunt, fish, or otherwise take wild animals. Because Minn.

Stat. &sect; 176.011, subd. 6(4) (1992) was applicable once it became effective. The court found that the department did not split the cause of action into two penalty cases because it commenced only one action. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 176.181, subd. 3(a) did not unconstitutionally delegate to the commissioner the authority to impose penalties. The statute provided a reasonably clear policy to guide the administrative officers because the statute specifically authorized a penalty of up to $ 1,000 per employer per week.

The police arrived at the apartment looking for the suspect but only defendant and one other person were home. Before being told to look around the apartment by defendant, one of the officers began to conduct a protective sweep of the apartment, claiming the sweep was necessary for their safety. The officer looked into a closet in the bedroom and saw a bag containing approximately one pound of marijuana, several other bags of similar size, and a scale. The officers froze the scene, advised both individuals of their rights, and called for help and a search warrant. Defendant was later charged and convicted. He sought review, challenging the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence flowing from the protective sweep that was not conducted incident to an arrest. On appeal, the court overturned his conviction. The court held that, because the officers were not going to the apartment to arrest anyone and because there was no evidence that anyone else was in the apartment, there was not a legal justification for conducting a protective sweep search. The evidence flowing from that search should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the licensee was questioned in a parking lot of a bar and grill about a domestic situation. A police officer concluded that the licensee had been using alcohol and his license was cancelled. The trial court upheld the revocation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court, relying on the officer's report, had sufficient evidence to believe that the licensee consumed alcohol and to find that the cancellation of the driver's license was proper. Further, the court held that the trial court's limitation of one-half hour for oral testimony was a reasonable exercise of control over the mode of the presentation of the evidence pursuant to Minn.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that (1) the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 631.04 was a moot issue because the trial court based its conclusions of law upon Minn.

The trial court denied the motion and found the hunter guilty. The trial court specifically found that the decoys belonged to the hunter and were in public waters between sunset and one hour before lawful shooting hours, that in the immediate area of the decoys there was natural vegetation growing in water sufficient to partially conceal a hunter, that there were other private owners of land who could provide hunters access to the public waters of the lake, and that the hunter could hunt in the area where the decoys were situated without committing a trespass. The court rejected the hunter's challenge of the trial court's interpretation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 97B.811, subd. 3 (1994) and affirmed the judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court, when considering appellant's habeas petition, determined that the transcript of the initial hearing before the committing court showed that the Pearson factors required for a psychopathic personality commitment had been established by clear and convincing evidence. The court agreed. Appellant claimed that the record did not show Pearson's first prong, a habitual course of misconduct in sexual matters, because only two rapes were established. However, a habitual course of conduct was demonstrated by sexual acts, not just convictions. Appellant had admitted to a court-appointed examiner that in the short time he was out prison after one conviction, he attempted rape on five occasions. The record also clearly demonstrated that appellant exhibited a loss of control over his sexual impulses, which was Pearson's second prong. Appellant had not challenged the applicability of the third Pearson prong, namely, that a person was likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury or pain on the object of his desire. The court granted appellant's motion to accept his pro se brief but rejected his double jeopardy and equal protection claims.</SPAN></P>

The grand jury indictment against defendant was dismissed on the grounds that Minn. Stat. &sect; 211B.06 (1994) was unconstitutionally overbroad and was preempted by federal law. On appeal, the court concluded that &sect; 211B.06 was not preempted by federal law, but that the extension of criminal liability to those who had only a &quot;reason to believe&quot; the campaign material was false made the statute unconstitutionally overbroad. The court reasoned that it may have been possible to apply a narrowing construction of the statute to avoid a finding of unconstitutionality. However, because of the way in which the offense was presented to the grand jury, it was not possible to apply a narrowing construction. Although the prosecutor deleted the &quot;reason to believe&quot; language in instructing the grand jury on the elements of the offense, the prosecutor displayed by overhead projector the full statute, including the &quot;reason to believe&quot; language, both before and after the evidence was presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In affirming the judgment, the court held that defendant's claims that the simple and aggravated robbery statutes were unconstitutionally vague because they overlapped, and that he was entitled to be sentenced on the simple robbery conviction instead of the aggravated robbery conviction, had been raised on direct appeal and thus could not be considered in a postconviction proceeding. It also held that defendant's claim that he was entitled to a new trial because a witness perjured herself during trial was barred because it could have been raised on direct appeal, and because it lacked sufficient factual support. The court also held that the claim that the trial court erred by ordering him to pay restitution to the Victim Reparations Board because the Board was not a &quot;victim&quot; under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 611A.04 or 611A.045 was also barred because it could have been raised on direct appeal.

The trial court found no justification for the discovery violation but stated that it would allow the witness to testify if defendant paid the jury costs incurred in granting the State a continuance. When defendant was unable to pay, the trial proceeded without the testimony and a jury found defendant guilty.

On the other hand, the teacher's tort claims did not challenge his suspension or seek his reinstatement.

Having failed to consider those factors, the trial court erred by temporarily enjoining the operation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 148.09. The injunction altered, rather than maintained, the status quo between the parties. Because the Board's authority to investigate chiropractors was not granted by Minn. Stat. &sect; 148.09, respondents did not demonstrate how their claimed injury, being targeted for frequent or particularly harassing investigations, would be prevented by the injunction of that statute. The record did not establish that respondents were likely to prevail on the merits of their case. The Board, however, offered several seemingly rational goals that were served by Minn. Stat. &sect; 148.09. In light of the established law, the trial court's conclusion that respondents were likely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim was erroneous. Respondents were also not likely to succeed in challenging the statute on the ground that it violated separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 244.965 required certain doors in apartment buildings to have a certain fire-resistive rating. After &sect; 244.965 was passed, the inspections department determined that &quot;10 minute fire resistive&quot; doors met the requirements. Later the department changed its policy and required that the doors be &quot;20 minute fire resistive.&quot; The city issued work orders requiring the owners to replace the apartment entry doors in their two apartment buildings. The owners appealed to the housing board of appeals, which denied the appeal. The owners did not appeal the board's decision, but filed suit in district court. The district court found that &sect; 244.965 was constitutional and then dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the court reversed, stating that the challenge to the work orders involved the interpretation of the ordinance by the city and the department. The court noted that a writ of certiorari was not available to review legislative or purely ministerial acts of administrative agencies or officers. The court stated that the board's jurisdiction was limited and it did not have the authority to quash or modify any order enforcing the building code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in possession of various illegal lights on his car and had been seen by an official police officer pretending to act as a police officer. Defendant had stopped another vehicle and was seen standing at the driver's window of the stopped car examining a driver's license. He was convicted and sought review. On appeal, the court upheld the conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erroneously refused to suppress evidence obtained after an allegedly unconstitutional police stop of his car. The court ruled that the police officer testified that he personally viewed some of the suspect equipment before stopping defendant. The court held that direct observation of equipment that could violate statutory law was an adequate basis for making an investigatory stop of a vehicle. The court further rejected defendant's argument that his convictions had to be overturned because he was denied his right to a speedy trial. The court found that a trial court did not abuse its discretion by delaying a trial beyond the requested 60-day speedy trial limit where there was good cause or exigent circumstances substantiated by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 327C.095, subds. 1-5 (1988), the city adopted Bloomington, Minn., City Code art. VI, 15.69, which required the landowners to pay a displaced resident's reasonable cost of relocating upon the closure of a mobile home park. The landowners claimed that this constituted a taking without compensation because the impact of the ordinance forced them to sale their park at a reduced price. The court held that the city-wide legislative land-use regulation substantially advanced a legitimate governmental purpose under a Takings Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V, analysis by protecting mobile home park residents from severe or complete losses of their investments in their homes when the owners of a park decide to close it. The ordinance also had a direct nexus to the interest of lessening the economic devastation imposed on the displaced residents. The ordinance was not invalid under Minnesota's Takings Clause, Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 because there was no evidence that it was designed to benefit a governmental enterprise. Applying the same takings analysis to an equal protection claim under Minnesota's constitution resulted in the same outcome.</SPAN></P>

The officer then observed indicia of intoxication and later arrested defendant. Defendant moved to suppress all evidence, which the trial court denied. After conviction, defendant appealed.

However, testimony was also received regarding the patient's recent inappropriate sexual behavior. The petition was denied, and the patient appealed, claiming that the statute under which he was hospitalized was void on constitutional grounds because it violated the single subject rule. The court found that the amendment to the statute relating to discharge procedures for psychopathic personalities could be thought of as a way of preventing crime by ensuring that only patients who were ready would be discharged. Thus, the single subject rule was not violated. The patient's due process and equal protection rights were not violated.

The district court adjudicated him the father of respondent mother's adult child and ordered him to pay various expenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court ordered the father to submit to a blood test, which revealed a 99.99 percent probability that he was the father of the adult child. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, although not for the reason that the statute of limitations had expired, as argued by the father. The court held that the mother did not have standing to bring a paternity action on behalf of her competent, adult son. The court noted that it was well established that a parent could bring an action on behalf of a minor child, there was no precedent for a parent bringing an action on behalf of a competent, living, adult child. The mother made no showing that her 21 year old son was incompetent; therefore, the court held that she had no further legal interest in the support of her child. As the mother had provided the court with no explanation of why she waited over 20 years to do bring an action to recover her lying-in expenses, the court concluded that her statutory right to recover the expenses had, at the very least, expired under the doctrine of laches.</SPAN></P>

The court could find no authority recognizing that it was improper to distinguish among potential jurors on the basis of a minimum age. Further, the court found that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had addressed the issue and found no constitutional violations. The court also found that the trial curt did not abuse its discretion in its instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, sports suppliers and an employee. Appellants, marketing company, owner, and commission salesperson, sought review, and the sports suppliers cross-appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the Minnesota Sales Representative Act (Act), Minn. Stat. &sect; 325E.37.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marketing company, owner, and commission salesperson brought an action against sports suppliers and an employee, for claims including age discrimination and violations of the Act, and violation of a noncompetition agreement. The court held that the owner and commission salesperson did not raise genuine issues of material fact regarding whether they were employees of the sports suppliers. The marketing company could not sustain a claim under the Act for age discrimination because the sports suppliers could not have discriminated against it on the basis of its age. The owner and commission salesperson's age discrimination claims failed because they never applied to be the sports suppliers' salaried sales employees. The contract contained a notice of termination provision of 90 days and the Act required only another 90 days, thus the Act did not substantially impair the contract between the parties. The noncompetition agreement between the marketing company and the employee failed for lack of consideration, thus the tortious interference with contract claim failed. Because the rights of the parties were governed by a valid contract, the unjust enrichment claims failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the sports suppliers and employee on all claims but reversed on the marketing company's claim under the Act, which did not unconstitutionally impair the sports suppliers' contract with the marketing company. The court remanded the issues of the sports suppliers' failure under the contract to give the marketing company 90 days' notice of termination and the sports suppliers' violation of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ruled that the State failed to meet its burden of showing that the prosecution and the evidence were not tainted by the use or derivative use of the deputies' compelled self-incriminatory statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deputies allegedly assaulted an inmate. The internal affairs unit took statements from several witnesses, including the deputies. Before giving their statements, the deputies signed an advisory that informed each of them that failure to answer questions could result in termination of employment. The State filed a misdemeanor complaint against each deputy. The deputies sought dismissal of the complaints because they were tainted by the prosecution's possible exposure to the statements and sought to suppress testimony of 12 witnesses who may have been exposed to the statements. The trial court dismissed the complaints, reasoning that the State failed to show that the complaints were not based on the use of the deputies' statements. It also suppressed the testimony of the 12 challenged witnesses, ruling that the State failed to show that the witnesses were free from the taint of the use of the statements. The court affirmed. Because the State did not meet its burden of affirmatively proving that the evidence it proposed to use was derived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled statements, the trial court did not err in suppressing the testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision against the State. It did not err by dismissing the complaints against the deputies and suppressing the testimony of the 12 witnesses.

The court did not have jurisdiction over one of the deputy's challenge to the trial court's order denying her motion for a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 152.021, subd. 1(1), 152.096, subd. 1, possession of cocaine in a park zone in violation of Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant urged that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions for the conspiracy and possession offenses. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The record showed that the police became interested in his dwelling, as he had a large number of visitors, and that defendant sold some cocaine to an informant. At the time of his arrest, a large amount of cash was found hidden in plastic bags. He advanced no specific hypothesis of innocence. Rather, he argued that the State could not prove the existence of a conspiracy between him and an alleged accomplice based on the accomplice's presence in his kitchen when a sale of a larger amount of cocaine was made to the informant. However, defendant referred the informant to the accomplice when the informant inquired about purchasing the larger amount of cocaine. After the sale of such large amount of cocaine to the informant, both defendant and his accomplice wired large sums of money to the same person. The court opined that such facts collectively established the existence of a conspiracy. Nor was scientific proof needed of the weight of the cocaine that formed the subject matter of the parties' agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the St. Louis County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of driving without automobile insurance. Defendant claimed that the Minnesota No-Fault Automobile Insurance Act, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 65B.48 and 169.797 (1994), was unconstitutional, discriminating against him on the basis of his economic status and restricting his right to intrastate travel because he was unable to afford insurance premiums.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted to driving without insurance and after his license had been revoked. The court rejected his constitutional claim. Requiring drivers to maintain insurance might limit a person's ability to drive a motor vehicle but did not amount to an actual deterrent to travel; driving was only one of many possible ways to travel. The purposes of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 65B.48 and 169.797 (1994) were narrowly tailored to meet the state's interest in having drivers insured to compensate accident victims. The statutes did not impede travel. They created a classification between those who could afford insurance and those who could not, but the financial burden was necessary and was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in protecting its citizens. Thus, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 65B.48 and 169.797 (1994) withstood intermediate scrutiny and were constitutional. Defendant's driving record included DWI offenses and numerous citations for driving after cancellation, withdrawal, and revocation; his cost and financial burden were directly related to his driving record. The law did not discriminate against defendant or deny him the right to equal protection, due process, or intrastate travel.</SPAN></P>

Based upon a study of the effect of adult businesses on neighborhoods, which concluded that such businesses produced negative &quot;secondary effects,&quot; the city council amended a zoning ordinance categorizing the owner's business as &quot;adult uses-principal business,&quot; and requiring it to be located at least 1,000 feet from certain protected uses. The owner's business was within 1,000 feet of a day-care center and a church and violated the ordinance. He unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance in federal court, and the city then filed an action against him seeking declaratory relief and an injunction preventing the operation of the business. On appeal from a summary judgment for the city, the court held that: (1) the issue of the applicability of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel to the owner's constitutional challenge was not properly before the court because the city had failed to file a notice of review; (2) the ordinance was a time, place, and manner regulation because it did not completely ban adult businesses; and (3) the ordinance was valid because it was not impermissibly overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>

During an investigation of drug paraphernalia sales, an informant bought a pipe from the retailer at three different times. Based on the controlled buys, the officer obtained a warrant to search the retailer for paraphernalia and seized pipes, ashtrays, pipe cleaners, scales, mirrors, display signs, and an invoice. Viewing the evidence most favorably to respondents, the court stated that summary judgment was properly denied to appellants because there were genuine issues of material fact regarding immunity. The court observed that a question remained whether the informant told the sales clerk that he intended to use the pipes for illegal drugs because a &quot;one-hitter&quot; was not necessarily associated with illegal drugs. The court found that a genuine issue of fact remained whether the officer was aware of the identities of the employees making the sales before seeking the warrant. The court concluded that without disputed facts, neither search warrant supported probable cause, and the City's liability for failure to train its employees was a question for the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, which denied appellants' motion for summary judgment in respondents' civil action against them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner operated a retail liquor store located on a block in the city that included other businesses and a parking lot for its customers. The driveway of the parking lot crossed a city sidewalk. The individual slipped and fell on the sidewalk at the point where the driveway crossed it. He testified that there was patchy ice on the sidewalk. Upon review, the court found that because the city was now immune from liability claims based on snow and ice conditions on sidewalks under 1986 Minn. Laws ch. 455, &sect; 65, it did not mean that abutting landowners were no longer protected from liability. It was the city's duty to keep the sidewalk reasonably safe. The individual was not unconstitutionally denied redress for his injuries because there was no common law right to sue an abutting landowner for injuries caused by slipping and falling on a city sidewalk. The landowner's liability could not be based on a city ordinance that required it to keep the sidewalk clear because the violation ran to the city alone. The individual failed to introduce sufficient evidence to establish that the landowner's use of the sidewalk was an extraordinary use.</SPAN></P>

On direct appeal, the conviction was affirmed. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was denied his constitutional right to assistance of counsel because the district court denied his request to have counsel appointed for the post-conviction proceedings. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.05 (1994), defendant was not entitled to have a public defender appointed to represent him in the post-conviction proceedings because defendant had already directly appealed his conviction. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to withdraw his motion for post-conviction relief because the petition did not identify issues justifying a withdrawal. The trial court's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant's allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel was not erroneous because defendant's direct appeal would not have been different even if his attorney had taken the steps defendant claimed he should have taken. The trial court's failure to make findings of fact or conclusions of law in denying defendant's motion for post-conviction relief was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency and city adopted a redevelopment plan for properties owned and operated by the store owners. After negotiations began, the retail business of the stores diminished and the store owners could not market the properties to potential tenants. In addition, the fair market value of the properties decreased and the store owners could not sell the properties. The store owners filed an action against the agency and city for an unconstitutional taking of property, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contract. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the pleadings did not establish a compensable taking of the storeowners' properties. The store owners claimed on appeal that pleadings established that precondemnation activities by the agency and city substantially interfered with their revenue and that the interference denied them all economically reasonable use of their properties. The court ruled that the pleadings permitted proof that the action by the agency and city left the store owners without economically viable rental and development uses for their property and that the store owners had a right to recovery for an unlawful taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were two of four men that stole and vandalized a snowmobile. Defendants were charged with theft of a motor vehicle and conspiracy to commit theft. Defendants were offered pre-trial diversion. The pre-trial diversion program required defendants to make restitution to the victim. When defendants could not agree on a restitution amount, the matter was submitted to the district court, which ordered defendants to pay approximately $ 923 each. The court declined to review the reasonableness of the restitution amount because it concluded that the terms a prosecutor imposes on participants in a pretrial diversion program are the product of an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Nothing in the diversion-program statute allowed for judicial review of a prosecutor's decision to divert offenders from the criminal process. Minn. Stat. &sect; 401.065, subd. 1(2) (1994) and Minn. R. Crim. P. 30.01 vest the prosecuting attorney with the authority to decide which offenders to refer for pretrial diversion and the terms of an individual offender's program. To review the terms of the diversion program would be to impermissibly intrude into an area reserved for prosecutorial discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner disputed the legality of special assessments imposed by respondent City of Minneapolis, Minnesota for municipal services performed on his property. The issues included whether the City had the authority to levy special assessments for abating nuisances, whether the assessment violated the Minnesota Constitution, and whether a hearing before a hearing officer rather than the City Council violated the owner's right to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special assessments had been imposed for municipal services performed prior to the owner's purchase of the property. They were cancelled in a foreclosure action but a hearing officer recommended reassessing them. Acting pro se, the owner appealed. The court held that Minn. Stat. ch. 429, made applicable to the City by 1969 Minn. Laws 499, &sect;&sect; 1-2 and amended by 1994 Minn. Laws 587, art. 9, &sect; 4, authorized the City to collect special assessments for abating nuisances. The definition of nuisances in Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 227.90 (1989) included noxious weeds, grass over eight inches tall, garbage, and brush that constituted a hazard to the public, some of which were removed from the owner's property. It was proper for the City to act under both Minn. Stat. ch. 429 and the ordinance. Further, 1994 Minn. Laws 587, art. 9, &sect; 4 was not applied retroactively. The assessment did not violate Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The court held that the assessment was presumptively valid and the abatement of a nuisance was an improvement. The City followed the procedures in Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 227.100, which provided the owner with the requisite due process.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the denial, arguing that the notice of intent was inadequate and that she was not given notice and a hearing. The court affirmed. The court held that both the Minnesota and the United States Constitutions provided individuals with protection from seizure of private property by the government. The appropriate judicial review was afforded in the Act and stated in language reasonably comprehensible to a person of ordinary intelligence. Although defendant was not afforded a pre-forfeiture hearing, she was afforded a post-forfeiture hearing, which satisfied due process requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction and sentence of the District Court, Goodhue County (Minnesota). He was indicted by a grand jury on six criminal counts, including premeditated first-degree murder. A jury found him not guilty of the first-degree murder charge, but found him guilty of three criminal counts, including the lesser-included offense of second-degree manslaughter under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.205, subd. 1 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was killed in his home by a shotgun wound to the head. Defendant was 16 years of age at the time of the offense. Although his case was never under the juvenile court's jurisdiction, he filed motions to return the case to juvenile court for sentencing and for a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines, based on the presentence investigation report. His motions were denied. He urged, inter alia, that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the disposition of his case, as he was found guilty of the lesser-included offense of second-degree manslaughter. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence. The grand jury indictment for first-degree murder took the case out of the delinquency jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the District Court, Winona County (Minnesota), wherein, after a hearing, he was committed as a sexual psychopathic personality and as a sexually dangerous person. Respondent State filed the petition for commitment before the scheduled date for appellant's release from prison, where he had been serving a sentence for second-degree assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had a long history of rapes and other sexual assaults. He previously had been civilly committed in Illinois as a sexual psychopath. Thereafter, he was found guilty in Minnesota of third-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping. Those convictions were affirmed on appeal. At the time of the instant action, he was serving a sentence for second-degree assault. He claimed, inter alia, that there was insufficient evidence as to his lack of control pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (1994). One court-appointed examiner opined that appellant's control, while impaired, was not utterly lacking, but that he suffered from a personality disorder. The court affirmed the judgment of commitment. The nature and frequency of appellant's sexual assaults, his impulsiveness, and the degree of his violence, among other factors, showed his utter lack of control. The court opined that appellant remained a danger to others. Thus, there was clear and convincing evidence from which to conclude that he was a sexually dangerous person and that he had a sexual psychopathic personality, under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (1994), 253B.02, subd. 18a (1994), respectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment from the District Court, Hennepin County (Minnesota), which dismissed its motor vehicle forfeiture action brought under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.1217 (1994) on the grounds that forfeiture of the vehicle used by the driver while committing an aggravated driving while under the influence (DWI) offense constituted a second punishment under the state and federal Double Jeopardy Clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the driver's conviction for aggravated DWI, the city brought a motor vehicle forfeiture action under &sect; 169.1217. The trial court concluded that the forfeiture constituted a second punishment under the state and federal Double Jeopardy Clauses because the driver had previously been convicted and sentenced for aggravated DWI. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered summary judgment in favor of the city. The forfeiture statute subjected the vehicle to forfeiture because it was used in the commission of a designated offense, the driver's conviction for aggravated DWI under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.129. The court found that the motor vehicle forfeiture statute had the remedial purpose of protecting the public from intoxicated drivers through forfeiture of the instrumentality of the crime. The vehicle was essential to the underlying criminal offense of driving while under the influence and therefore, it was an instrumentality of the crime. There was a clear rational relation between vehicle forfeiture under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.1217 and its remedial purpose. The statute only applied where a driver had not heeded the warnings of previous sentences and license revocations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the city's forfeiture action and remanded for the entry of summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer was called to a restaurant and three possibly intoxicated women were pointed out to him. Shortly after leaving a second call was made to the dispatcher, who reported to the officer that the three women had entered a car and left the restaurant. The officer observed the car and noticed a turn signal made in the middle of the turn, a wide turn, and an object hanging from the mirror. The officer stopped the vehicle and gave the driver field sobriety tests, which she failed. The driver's license was revoked when she refused to submit to testing. The driver argued that the officer had no articulable suspicion to stop and the trial court should have rescinded the revocation of her license. The court held that the officer was not simply relying upon someone's report about the driver's intoxication, without independent observation of the driver's behavior. In affirming the judgment the court held that although the traffic violations provided a weak reason to stop, the trial court properly determined that given the totality of the circumstances the officer's stop was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant admitted to a charge of indecent exposure committed against his sister. Although there was to be no out-of-home placement, the trial court accepted a probation's officer's recommendation that appellant be placed into a residential treatment program. Appellant argued that the disposition order was an abuse of discretion and that the trial court's written findings were insufficient. On appeal, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering appellant, who was adjudicated for indecent exposure and had no new offenses or probation violations in the nearly two years following the offense, into residential treatment. The disposition was not the least restrictive means available and was not in appellant's best interests. There was no evidence showing that appellant had a sexual problem requiring treatment. Further, the trial court's bare statement without any specific findings that the best interests of appellant required the disposition was insufficient. The trial court's findings were inadequate because they did not show why less restrictive alternatives were rejected.</SPAN></P>
