</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A limited autopsy was actually performed by the physician but he prepared an autopsy report indicating a much more extensive examination was done. The Michigan Attorney General filed a complaint with the Board charging a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.16221(a), (b)(i) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.15(a), (b)(i)). Following an administrative hearing, a hearing examiner found that authoring the fictitious report constituted negligence or failure to exercise due care in violation of the charging statute. First, the court held that the circuit court erred when it held that the standard pronounced in the statute, which was negligence or failure to exercise due care, was not sufficiently precise to notify the physician of the conduct proscribed. The court reasoned that negligence was a well-recognized legal concept. Second, the hearing examiner's dismissal of three other counts was not inconsistent with his findings on the fourth count and did not evince an arbitrary application of the standard recited in &sect; 16221(a). Third, expert testimony was not necessary to substantiate a finding of negligence or failure to exercise due care in the case before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and reinstated the Board's initial order suspending the physician.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After some derogatory remarks were made about the police officer's race, he was shot by an off-duty fellow officer.

The jury returned a verdict against the city and the shooter, which the shooter did not appeal. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding insufficient evidence to support the police officer's &sect; 1983 action. The court held that the single incident in question was not sufficient to prove that the city had a policy or custom of toleration towards firearm abuse and the use of racially derogatory language. The court found that evidence of the city's policy or custom independent of the other officer's misconduct was necessary to meet the burden of proof. The court also noted that the policy alleged was not unconstitutional in and of itself. Therefore, the police officer failed to prove that his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated based on a right to be free from physical harm, violence, and injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customers asserted that that the trial court erred in applying the traditional rational basis test of equal protection in its analysis, rather than the stricter means scrutiny test. The court found persuasive the findings of fact of the trial court that the customers used common areas to provide business quarters to promote its business in renting complex unit. The trial court found that the customers were similar to a general service customer than to residential customers, as such, there was a reasonable relationship between classifying the electric service used in common areas of multiple-family dwellings served by a single meter at a commercial rather than a residential rate. The court found that the trial court's opinion supported the findings that the classification with regard to multiple family dwellings common areas had reasonable basis and did not offend the Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions merely because it was not made with mathematical nicety. The court also found that the classification had a fair-and-substantial-relationship relationship to its perceived purpose. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Acts 287, was not in furtherance of privacy, the meaning of &sect; 750.540c was ambiguous, and it was unconstitutional. The court held that this contention was without merit because 1982 Mich. Pub. Acts 287 dealt not only with personal privacy but also with business, sporting, commercial, or other news reports and was thus a continuation of the original intent. The court also found meritless, the seller's contention that &sect; 750.540c was so vague as to render its application uncertain and a denial due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents appealed from an order of a trial court (Michigan), which accelerated judgment on the parents' action that alleged malpractice during the birth of their son. The trial court granted the motion of defendants, doctors and a hospital, on the ground that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 116.1(2) (1963) because the mother had signed binding arbitration agreements for herself and her son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents alleged that defendants had been negligent in failing to properly diagnose the baby's large size, resulting in a vaginal delivery that was improper and caused injuries to the baby. After the mother was discharged, she signed two arbitration agreements, one for herself and one on behalf of her son, but later tried to have them invalidated after the end of the cancellation period. The trial court found that it had no jurisdiction because of the agreements. The court affirmed, finding that the Medical Malpractice Arbitration Act (MMAA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5040 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5040 et seq.), was not unconstitutional because of the mandatory inclusion of a physician or hospital administrator on the arbitration panel. Further, the mother had intentionally waived her right to a jury trial by signing the agreements. The arbitration agreement clearly indicated that arbitration was an alternative to trial by jury. Therefore, the agreements to arbitrate were presumed valid and bound the son and father. Last, the parents had not alleged any facts to support a finding that the agreements could be set aside as having been fraudulently induced.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment accordingly. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee claimed that a work uniform requirement of high-heeled shoes, short skirt, and low-cut blouse was discriminatory and subjected her to sexual harassment. The employer and supervisors replied that the uniform requirement was a customary industry practice. The employee further claimed that the employer and supervisors harassed her into quitting her job in retaliation for filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in federal court. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason based upon the industry's customary practices was insufficient to rebut the employee's prima facie case of sex discrimination as a matter of law. In short, evidence of the customary usage and practice of an industry was totally irrelevant to a determination of whether such practice or custom was discriminatory. Likewise, a letter stating that the employee had failed to establish an unfair labor practice under federal law was irrelevant to the employee's retaliation claim under the act. Further, the letter was clearly inadmissible hearsay. Thus, the trial court's admission of the letter was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Although the lower court had jurisdiction over &sect; 1983 actions against the state, its agencies, and their directors, the court held that such actions could not be maintained against the state or its agencies because Congress had not abrogated states' sovereign immunity from &sect; 1983 suits, the state had not waived its immunity, and the state was not a person for &sect; 1983 purposes. Thus, the judgment against the state police department was vacated. However, the court found that a &sect; 1983 action could be maintained against the director of the state department of police. Because there was no inquiry as to his possible immunity, the court ordered a remand.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed as of right from his convictions following a jury trial in the trial court (Michigan) for resisting and obstructing an arrest, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.479 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.747), and malicious destruction of police property, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.337b (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.609(2)), and from his sentence of two concurrent six month terms of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both convictions arose from an incident in which defendant kicked a police car door twice on being arrested, one kick resulting in the door flying into the police officer and the other kick shattering the window. Defendant argued that as both convictions arose from the same transaction, he received multiple punishments for the same offense and that the jury should have been instructed that resisting an arrest was a specific intent crime. The state maintained that there were two acts: the kick to resist arrest and the kick to vent defendant's anger, thus justifying both of defendant's convictions. In affirming the convictions, the court ruled that defendant committed two separate acts, which violated two separate statutes, each of which was intended to prevent a different type of harm, and thus there was no double jeopardy in the two convictions. Further, the court ruled that any error by the trial court in failing to correct the state's use of the term &quot;bastard&quot; on one occasion was harmless error which did not necessitate reversal. Moreover, defendant's contention that the jury should have been instructed that resisting an arrest was a specific intent crime was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for resisting and obstructing an arrest and for malicious destruction of police property as separate offenses.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner filed an action against the Department alleging that it could not exclude drug traffickers from the placement programs. The trial court ruled for the Department, and the court affirmed. The court held that the policy directive did not have been promulgated as a rule in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. The directive could fairly be considered a functional interpretation of rule 791.4410. Neither the enabling legislation nor the Department's rules and policy directives guaranteed or required that a prisoner meeting the eligibility criteria would be accorded placement in a community program. The director of the Department was provided wide discretion to determine whom he would release. The possibility of participation in the community placement program did not rise to the level of a liberty interest protected by due process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant State of Michigan pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 117.2(1) (1963) on the ground that plaintiffs had not pled facts in avoidance of governmental immunity in a wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that while receiving treatment as an inpatient of a psychiatric hospital, plaintiffs' decedent was physically restrained in a manner which strangled or choked him and caused the blood supply to his brain to be stopped, resulting in death. Plaintiffs further alleged that the negligent and intentional acts or omissions of defendant were reasonably and substantially likely to result in the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16 (1963), while depriving decedent of life without due process of law, contrary to U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 (1963). Plaintiffs brought their federal constitutional claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Defendant argued that &sect; 1983 was inapplicable because the State was not a person within the meaning of that section. The court found that although the State was a &quot;person&quot; for purposes of &sect; 1983 liability, the State was immune from liability because Congress did not intend by the general language of &sect; 1983 to override the traditional sovereign immunity of the States. Also, plaintiffs did not state a cause of action under Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 (1963).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police officer arranged to buy cocaine from a codefendant's unidentified accomplice, to whom the officer had only spoken by telephone. Defendant and two codefendants met with the officer in a car. After a discussion, defendant and a codefendant went inside a nearby restaurant, after which the other codefendant, still outside, sold a quantity of cocaine to the officer. Defendant and the codefendants were arrested. At trial, the officer testified that he recognized defendant's voice as the accomplice on the telephone and that he discussed the drug purchase with defendant in the car. Defendant's testimony contradicted the officer's version, denying any knowledge of the drug sale. Defendant was convicted of the drug sale as an accessory and sentenced to 20 to 30 years. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not entrapped because the officer's conduct did not amount to impermissible police conduct; the evidence was sufficient to conclude that defendant abetted the drug sale; the prosecutor was not improperly permitted to submit evidence to bolster the officer's character; and neither the sentence nor the statute under which it was imposed were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that the denial of the complaint for habeas corpus was not properly before the court on appeal. A writ of error did not lie to review habeas corpus proceedings. Even if the complaint were properly before the court, the inmate did not establish a basis for issuing the writ. First, the parole-violation warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The warrant did not have to be supported by a showing of probable cause or by oath or affirmation because such requirements did not apply to warrants to revoke parole. Secondly, the preliminary determination of probable cause and probation revocation hearing provided to the inmate exceeded the minimum due process requirements for probation revocation.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court reviewed arguments that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.2(b) (Mich. Stat. Ann &sect; 27.3178(598.2(b)) and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.19a (Mich. Stat.

The court held the statutes were constitutional. Respondents had no standing to argue that the statutes were overbroad when their conduct clearly fit within the statutes. The statutes were not void for vagueness because the probate court's discretion was limited by appellate court decisions. Definition of the terms &quot;proper,&quot; &quot;fit home,&quot; and &quot;mental deficiency or mental illness&quot; used in the statute could be determined from their context and were not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

The manufacturer, which was not a party to the dispute before the commission, was aggrieved by the commission's action and thus was allowed to intervene to request a review of the commission's order. The draw poker video machine, however, was not a gaming device. The court held that language in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.303(2) limiting the device to allowing 15 free games was unconstitutional. The remainder of &sect; 750.303(2), which legalized machines that had an element of skill where the reward was limited to free games, was constitutional and was applicable to the machine held by the club licensee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with embezzlement by a trustee of a sum in excess of $ 100. After the trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, defendant brought an interlocutory appeal. The court reversed the trial court's judgment on the ground that defendant could not be tried for embezzlement without violating double jeopardy because defendant had previously had a contempt adjudication entered against her. However, the supreme court vacated the court's judgment and remanded for reconsideration in light of a recent decision. Upon remand, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss because: (1) Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.1745 evidenced a clear legislative intent to impose separate punishment on a person who had been adjudged in contempt of court if those actions that constituted contempt were also violative of some criminal provision; and (2) contempt was designed to punish offenses against the court and, as such, represented a separate and distinct offense from the criminal act that provided the basis for the contempt adjudication; accordingly, defendant could be tried for embezzlement without violating double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The insureds appealed an order from the trial court (Michigan), which denied their motion to quash the writ despite having found that no in personam jurisdiction existed over the insureds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency obtained a prejudgment writ of garnishment pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.4011(3) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.4011(3)) against another insurance agency that owed the insureds refunds on several unrelated insurance policies. The court reversed the order that granted the writ and held that the referenced statute was unconstitutional because it was in derogation of the minimum contacts standard for due process. The statute allowed prejudgment garnishment only where the trial court issuing the writ of garnishment did not have personal jurisdiction over a defendant. Personal jurisdiction could be obtained over an out-of-state defendant under the Michigan long-arm statutes to the farthest extent permitted by due process. Due process required only that a defendant have certain minimum contacts with the state such that the exercise of jurisdiction did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Therefore, only in the absence of minimum contacts was the prejudgment garnishment statute applicable, and, as such, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the civil rights act's prohibitions against age discrimination in employment were not intended to supersede the retirement act's mandates, noting that new legislation was not presumed to impliedly repeal an apparently conflicting older statute unless the legislature clearly expressed an intent to repeal the older statute. The court also held that the civil rights act clearly excepted retirement plans, such as the one in which the civil servant participated, that were uniformly applied and that contained provisions for pension or other economic systems to protect the worker economically on retirement.The court further reasoned that the legislature, which was aware of the existence of retirement plans when it enacted the civil rights act, would have clearly expressed its intent to terminate all involuntary retirement if that result was desired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the revocation of his probation. Defendant's appeal was limited to matters relating to the probation violation; he was not entitled to challenge his underlying disposition. Defendant alleged that his pretrial detention was unconstitutional and that the 48-hour rule of Mich. Juv. Ct. R. 4.2(A) (1969) was not complied with. Defendant claimed he was not given a hearing within 48 hours after he was taken into custody, there was no indication that the court-ordered detention was based on probable cause, and he was denied bond. Defendant urged that the remedy for the procedural violations should be to vacate the order revoking his probation. Defendant was not objecting to anything that occurred at the probation revocation hearing itself; nor did the errors that proceeded that hearing deprive the court of jurisdiction. The court held that while the errors complained of infringed on defendant's right to due process, they were not of such magnitude as to compel the court to vacate the subsequent order revoking his probation. Defendant had not shown any prejudice resulting from the errors. The juvenile court was free to revoke probation upon a violation of its terms.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the department. The court rejected the company's contention that the term &quot;interstate commerce&quot; included both interstate and foreign commerce, thereby allowing an exclusion from sales tax in the instant case. The court held that the term &quot;interstate commerce&quot; in &sect; 4a(e) of the General Sale Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.54a(e) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.525(e)) was not ambiguous and did not exempt foreign commerce from the sales tax. The court also held that the company did not establish that the tax scheme discriminated against foreign commerce. The court concluded that a tax was not discriminatory merely because it increased the cost of doing business. Finally, the court rejected the company's assertion that the tax scheme was tantamount to regulation of foreign commerce, which was preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon statutory interpretation, defendant argued that the word timber had a specific meaning at the time the 1867 Legislature enacted the timber act. That definition was limited to wood felled or usable for building purposes. Because the court limited the meaning of the terms &quot;any tree&quot; or &quot;timber&quot; in the timber act to mean &quot;growing trees yielding wood suitable for constructive uses&quot; or &quot;such trees as are used in building, either ships or dwellings,&quot; the agreed with defendant's argument that the People had to present proof that the tree in question was suitable for such uses in order to have shown probable cause that defendant violated the timber act. Because the People failed to present proof that the six-or seven-foot pine tree at issue in the instant case could have yielded wood that could be used for constructive purposes, the court determined that the trial court did err by denying defendant's motion to quash.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the fire that destroyed the building, the state's no-fault automobile insurance act was in effect. The property provisions of the act were later declared unconstitutional and plaintiffs filed an action in tort liability to recover damages. The decision holding the property provisions unconstitutional was then reversed. In a pretrial action, the individual filed a motion for an accelerated judgment on the ground that the action was barred by a one-year statute of limitations set forth in the no-fault act. A pretrial judge denied the motion, finding that a three-year period applied for tort liability actions involving property damage. At trial, the individual renewed his motion for an accelerated judgment, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had no authority to hear the same motion as the pretrial judge as the latter was not absent or unable to act. As to the pretrial judge's order, the court stated that the statute of limitations in effect at the time the cause of action arose governed the situation. The court concluded that the one-year statute was in effect at that time and that plaintiffs' action was, therefore, untimely.</SPAN></P>

After defendant pleaded guilty to assault on a prison employee and the trial court imposed a sentence, defendant appealed the judgment as of right. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 750.197c was not unconstitutional because it did not violate the title-object clause of the Michigan Constitution. Further, defendant lacked standing to challenge the statute on the grounds of vagueness and overbreadth because it was not overbroad in relation to the conduct that formed the basis of his conviction. When defendant hit the guard on the nose with handcuffs, he committed an assault with a dangerous weapon and, in so doing, his conduct fell within the statute's prohibitions. Further, the prohibitions of &sect; 750.197c applied to assaults by prisoners upon prison employees, whether or not committed during an escape or attempted escape. The court noted, however, that a remand for resentencing was mandated because the trial court failed to articulate its reasons for imposing the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was convicted of first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to a supplemental information charging him as a habitual offender. The inmate was sentenced to concurrent life sentences on both charges. He sought a writ of mandamus to remove one of the sentences. The court noted that, ordinarily, the sentence as a habitual offender subsumed the sentence for the underlying felony, which would then be vacated on the grounds that the sentence under the habitual offender statute was traditionally as long or longer than the sentence for the underlying felony. However, the court found that, because the underlying felony in this case was first-degree murder, vacating the underlying sentence would result in a contrary result. Under the habitual offender statute, the inmate could be eligible for parole in 10 years rather than serving his life sentence without parole, as statutorily required for a first-degree murder conviction. Therefore, the court vacated the concurrent life sentence under the habitual offender statute to effectuate the legislative intent of that statute and to avoid the imposition of unconstitutional double punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the inmate's sentence as a habitual offender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant's child was in his care, he struck the child on the head with a hard object and shook the child so hard that the infant's brain was injured. The infant died because of swelling as a direct result of the trauma, and defendant was convicted. On appeal the court affirmed. The testimony supported a finding of gross negligence. The situation required ordinary care and diligence, and defendant had the ability to exercise ordinary care but failed to do so. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the phrase &quot;cruelly and unlawfully punishes&quot; in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.136 was unconstitutionally broad and impermissibly vague. The term gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair and adequate notice of the conduct proscribed by the statute and it did not confer unlimited, unstructured discretion to determine whether an offense has been committed. The court also rejected defendant's argument that cruelty to children, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.136, was a specific intent crime. It was sufficient to show that the punishment was cruel and unreasonably severe and such as in its very nature would negative the idea of good faith on the part of the parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged the trial court's grant of defendant's motion for summary judgment. The action arose from a two-car accident in which the husband suffered soft tissue injuries. On appeal, plaintiffs asserted that a soft tissue injury could be a serious impairment of body functions and that it was unconstitutional for a statute not to allow persons with soft tissue injuries a trial on the merits. The court noted that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3135 abolished tort liability for noneconomic losses unless certain threshold requirements were met. The court found that the husband's injuries were not subject to medical measurement and thus were not objectively manifested in a scientific or medical context. The court held that, because there was no distinction between persons with soft tissue injuries and those with other injuries, plaintiffs' argument that the statute and its interpretation were unconstitutional was without merit. The court concluded that the trial court was correct in determining as a matter of law that the husband's injuries failed to meet the minimum threshold requirement for recovery of noneconomic losses. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Authorities arranged to have a police informer incarcerated with defendant. Defendant made certain statements, often after prodding by the informer, indicating that defendant was considering having certain persons killed, and told the informer he would consider his offer to do the job. The trial court held that defendant's statements constituted incitement, but on appeal, the court reversed. The court rejected defendant's contention that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.157b (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.354(2)) was limited to street riot situations, or that the statute required actual incitement. The court also rejected defendant's contention that there was no such crime as inciting another to aid and abet a murder. However, the court held that in order to obtain a conviction, there had to be an element of imminence to the act which was being incited. Here there was no immediate action to kill the persons. Furthermore, there was insufficient proof of incitement, which meant urgent action, persuading, or urging earnestly, because it was the informer who did the inciting, inducing, and exhorting, and defendant mostly only responded to the informer's solicitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to criminal sexual conduct and carrying a concealed weapon. After his pleas were entered but before sentencing, the Michigan Supreme Court held that a defendant had to be given the opportunity to withdraw a guilty plea if the trial court rejected the sentence recommended by the prosecutor or if the trial court participated in discussions aimed at reaching a plea agreement. The trial court allowed defendant to withdraw his plea on the same day the Supreme Court modified its opinion to give it prospective application only. The trial court later reinstated the pleas. The court held that the reinstatement was proper because permission to withdraw the guilty pleas was granted under the mutually mistaken belief that the court was required to do so. The trial judge did not err in denying defendant's motion to withdraw the pleas once they were reinstated. There was no right to withdraw a guilty plea once it was accepted. There was no requirement for the trial court judge to disqualify himself after permitting defendant to withdraw his pleas, having heard defendant give a factual basis for the offenses to which he was pleading.</SPAN></P>

Defendants moved separately for accelerated judgments or to compel arbitration. The trial court granted the motions to compel arbitration and held the motions for accelerated judgment to be moot.

The supreme court then determined the arbitration act was constitutional. Plaintiff then contested the validity of the agreement by claiming that a parent could not waive a child's right to a jury trial by signing an arbitration agreement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On December 15, 1981, the patient commenced a medical malpractice action, alleging negligence in his care and treatment on July 1, 1977. Between the time of the alleged malpractice and filing suit, an arbitration panel was formed to consider the patient's claims. The arbitration panel denied the patient's claims on jurisdictional grounds. The trial court held that the patient's claims were not barred as a result of the statute of limitations because the statute of limitation was tolled during the period that the parties were in arbitration. The court disagreed and reversed the holding of the trial court. The court held that the tolling statute deals with prior &quot;lawsuits &quot; or &quot;court proceedings.&quot; The court indicated that it was persuaded by the policy arguments for allowing an arbitration proceeding as a tolling event because the scope and purpose of arbitration was comparable to that of a lawsuit. Nevertheless, in accordance with the court's understanding of the law in Michigan, it found it was compelled to decline to create an exception for arbitration proceedings to the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adult book store owner/operators argued that the injunction was void because the ordinance on which it was based was unconstitutional and was void because it was not adopted in accordance with the provisions of the enabling act, Mich.

The adult book store owner argued that his contempt conviction was void because it was based on a void ordinance and the pleadings did not establish the he had violated the injunction. The attorney contended that his contempt conviction was void because he had no notice of the proceeding and the conviction was based solely on his testimony as a witness at the contempt hearing of the adult book store operator. The court vacated the injunction because the requirement of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.584, the filing of a report by the municipality's planning commission had not been met. As to the adult book store owner's contempt conviction, the court upheld it as one did not have a right to violate a court order even if the order was clearly incorrect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township levied certain taxes, and the property owners sought a declaratory judgment that the taxes were illegal under the Charter Township Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 42.27. The township sought summary judgment, which the trial court granted, finding that the amended portion of the Act was unconstitutional under the uniformity clause of the Michigan Constitution. The court reversed because the uniformity clause did not prevent the legislature from establishing reasonable classifications within particular tax authorities where the purpose was to promote a more equitable tax burden. Subsequently, the Michigan Supreme Court issued an opinion in which it addressed the constitutionality of the use of a &quot;variable millage&quot; theory between two components of a single taxing territory. It ruled that &quot;variable millage&quot; was unconstitutional because it violated the uniformity clause and vacated and remanded the court's prior decision. On remand, the court ruled that the township taxes were to be levied at the same rate regardless of the number of communities in which the property was located and that the variable millage portions of the act were severable from the constitutional portions.</SPAN></P>

She also challenged the constitutionality of the cornea removal statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.10201 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.15(10201) et seq.</SPAN></P>

The defendants submitted affidavits of the technician who excised the corneas, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, and the funeral director who embalmed the body. Each stated that the decedent's eyes were not removed and that there was no disfigurement. The circuit court held that the mother had failed to prove that her daughter's eyes were removed and that the medical examiner had governmental immunity. The circuit court also held that the mother's constitutional challenge to the cornea removal statute was without merit. On appeal, the court affirmed. The mother failed to rebut the defendants' affidavits. The court rejected the mother's claim that as next of kin she had a fundamental right to bury her decedent's body without mutilation and that the cornea removal statute violated a right to privacy. The daughter's privacy right was the daughter's alone that could not be claimed by the daughter's estate or next of kin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was two years old. His mother testified that defendant resided with her and the victim. She testified to a series of physical abuses which included whippings on the victim's back and buttocks, forced stays in a closet, tying the victim's feet together, and handcuffing the victim to a doorknob. The mother also testified that defendant punched the victim in the mouth and chest. The court remanded the action to the trial court to resentence defendant on the crime of child cruelty. The trial court improperly denied defendant's request for an instruction of the lesser-included offense of child cruelty in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.136. The child torture statute required the infliction of extreme or severe pain or injury above and beyond the degree of pain or injury that was required for a child cruelty conviction. An offense was a necessarily lesser-included offense of another if it was impossible to commit the greater offense without also committing the lesser offense. Child cruelty was a lesser-included offense of child torture; however, defendant was not entitled to an attempted child cruelty instruction when there was no evidence that an attempt was committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed a suit against the department alleging that they earned a taxable income in excess of $ 65,000 and were affected by the credit reduction formula mandated by 1982 Mich.

Const. art 9, &sect;&sect; 3, 7 (1963) on the basis of due process and the title-object clause of Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 24 (1963). The trial court granted the owners' motion for summary judgment on the ground that the act was unconstitutional because it violated Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7 (1963). The court granted the department's motion for a stay of proceedings so that it could address the constitutionality of the act. The court ruled that the act did not violate Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7 (1963) because the property tax credit incremental reduction formula did not affect the fixed flat rate income tax liability imposed upon taxpayers with adjusted household incomes over $ 65,000. The court stated that the owners' income tax liability remained the same. The only tax liability affected by the act's formula was the property tax liability on their homestead.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner municipalities appealed an order from the Michigan Tax Tribunal, which dismissed petitioners' challenges to the propriety of a county equalization, made by respondent county board of commissioners, of a residential class of real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board of commissioners performed a county equalization of residential real property in two municipalities. One municipality challenged the equalization alleging, inter alia, that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.34(4) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;7.52(4)), providing for appeals on county equalization to the lower court, was unconstitutional in requiring proof of discrimination. The lower court dismissed the allegation on the grounds that it had no jurisdiction to decide the issue. On appeal, the court affirmed the lack of jurisdiction, addressed the constitutionality question, and remanded the cause on an unrelated issue. The court held that to the extent that the statute prevented the lower court from adjusting overassessed property downward, the municipality failed to show how it was aggrieved because overassessed property was an individual's problem and not that of a local governing unit. The court also held that the municipality failed to show how the standard of proving discrimination was too burdensome. The court found that the lower court's opinion was inadequate because it failed to address why it rejected the consideration of creative financing in determining true cash value.</SPAN></P>

The anchor was identified as a wood stock anchor believed to be off a sunken wreck which sank in the late 1800's and which was the first four-masted sailing vessel on the Great Lakes. At defendant's jury trial, the jury was requested to make a determination under &sect; 299.51 whether the anchor in question had significant historical or value because the state had reserved to itself a possessory right to that type of property found on the bottom of the Great Lakes. The jury found defendant guilty. The trial court set aside defendant's conviction and the court reversed and reinstated the conviction. The court held that the state did not intrude on the uniformity or purpose of admiralty and maritime law. Rather, the state supplemented the control over Great Lakes bottomlands granted to it by the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act and the federal Submerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1301 et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a mobile crane owner, sought review of a judgment by an Michigan trial court in favor of plaintiff employee and an award of attorney's fees in the employee's negligence action. The employee appealed a finding of comparative negligence, and plaintiff wife appealed a finding of no damages on her consortium claim. The owner had also filed a third-party complaint against third-party defendant employer for indemnity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a pipefitter and was injured when his glove got caught in a load of pipes and the operator of the owner's mobile crane, who was employed by the same company as the employee, took the load line up and crushed his hand. After the owner filed its third-party complaint for indemnity, the employer agreed to take over the defense for the owner. The jury found that the owner was liable for the negligent operation of the mobile crane under the owner's liability statute in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401 but reduced the employee's award by his 45 percent comparative negligence. The trial court denied the owner's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the trial court erred in determining that the mobile crane was a motor vehicle for purposes of &sect; 257.401 because the crane was being used as a piece of stationary construction equipment at the time and was not being driven from one job site to another. Therefore, the court did not address the other issues raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision that the owner's liability statute applied and, thus, did not address the other issues raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees in were fired after failing polygraph tests. On appeal in the first case, the employer contended that &sect; 26 of the Forensic Polygraph Examiners Act (FPEA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 338.1701 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18.186(1) et seq.) violated the single object clause, Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 24, by assessing a penalty against employers for using polygraphs to fire employees. The court agreed and reversed, holding that the provision was unconstitutional. The FPEA controlled polygraph examiners and machines. The subject provision was separate from the FPEA's purpose and had been repealed by the Polygraph Protection Act (PPA), 1982 Mich. Pub. Acts 44, which protected employees from employers' use of polygraphs. In the second case, the employees also challenged the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 37.2101 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.548(101) et seq.), asserting that polygraphs discriminated against blacks, older people, and people with high blood pressure. The court disagreed but reversed. Employees who objected to polygraphs were not an identifiable group. However, the legislature had since severed the polygraph provisions and included them in the PPA.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the finding that the highway department was negligent, holding that there was sufficient evidence of defective design and of constructive notice of the defect. The court also held that there was no clear error in the trial court's finding that the warning sign posted by the overpass did not constitute an adequate warning. The court reversed the apportionment of 75 percent negligence to plaintiff, holding that, although the comparative negligence doctrine did apply to the action, the trial court imposed an unduly restrictive standard in defining the scope of plaintiff's rescue mission. The court remanded for reconsideration of the scope of the rescue mission. The court also remanded for an adjustment to plaintiff's taxable costs to allow for expert witness fees. The court additionally held that the statute allowing five percent interest on a judgment in a court of claims action, was viable and not unconstitutional, and the state was not required to post a bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment to Mich. Comp.

The county refused to make the MOE payments, and the state officials notified the county that the unremitted MOE payments were going to offset against the county's revenue-sharing receipts. The county and the taxpayer filed suit challenging &sect; 400.109. The county further argued that the offset against revenue-sharing plans in order to collect the county's MOE obligation was improper. The trial court granted summary judgment for the state officials. The court affirmed the judgment to the extent that it upheld the new reimbursement system under &sect; 400.19. However, the court reversed the judgment to the extent that it allowed an offset against the county's revenue-sharing payments. The offset provisions amended the revenue-sharing provision by reference to its title only and thus violate Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landfill owners brought a suit against defendants seeking a declaration that the operation of the landfill was lawful and properly licensed. The landfill owners' license to operate had lapsed because cross-defendant state department of natural resources (DNR) had not processed a renewal.

When the airport closed, the DNR issued a conditional license that later became a final solid waste disposal license. The township filed a counter-claim, alleging that the DNR improperly treated the landfill as an existing facility instead of a new or proposed facility. The trial court held that the landfill owners' license was valid. Defendants sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the DNR's failure to revoke the license prevented it from expiring, and the Administrative Procedures Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.291(2) (Mich. Stat.

She also alleged violation of &sect; 1983 based upon invasion of privacy. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the county and its employees. The court determined that the inmate's clothing was removed for safety precautions related to suicide and that the complained-of conduct could not support a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress because it was not outrageous. Further, no liability on the claim could be imposed on the county because the jury implicitly found that neither employee committed the tort.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued defendant as a result of an automobile accident. Defendant admitted liability and the trial was on damages only. The jury returned a verdict in plaintiff's favor and the trial court partially granted defendant's motion for remittitur, reducing the award. Both plaintiff and defendant appealed and the court affirmed the judgment as entered. One of defendant's claims of error was the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on plaintiff's duty to mitigate damages. The court held that defendant failed to carry her burden of proving that plaintiff did not use every reasonable effort to minimize his damages. Furthermore, defendant's theory of the case was not that plaintiff failed to minimize damages, but rather that plaintiff had no injury at all. It was to apply a hypothetical set of facts to one of the jurors personally, but defendant failed to object and therefore waived the right to appellate review on that issue. The remittitur was affirmed because it was not shown that the trial court clearly abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court awarding damages to plaintiff but also affirmed the partial remittitur of damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee's award of disability benefits was affirmed by the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB), including a finding that defendant employer was not liable for the payment of benefits for weeks in which the employee's earning from another job exceeded a certain sum. The employee sought review of the WCAB's findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a teacher and took a second job with the employer during the summer season. While working for the employer, the employee injured his back, and was unable to work for a period of time. During this time, the employer was able to continue teaching, and the injury had no affect on his ability to do so. The employee sought disability benefits from the employer. The referee awarded benefits, but determined that the employer was not required to pay benefits in weeks when the employee earned income in excess of a specified sum from his teaching job. The WCAB affirmed. The court held that the employer was not entitled to an offset in the benefits due because the teaching job was not a substitute employment, and was not &quot;another employment&quot; within the meaning of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.371(1). The court found that the employee had two earning capacities, and was entitled to recover the full benefits from the employer with no consideration for his earnings as a teacher. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the WCAB's finding that the employee was only entitled to benefits from the employer for lost wages in the summer season.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of disability benefits to the employer, reversed the WCAB's finding that the employer was exempt from paying benefits in weeks in which the employee's earning from his other job exceeded a certain sum, and remanded the matter for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The Act was a legitimate exercise of the legislature's power on its determination that public financing of elections served the general welfare. The court held that the scheme was not entitled to equal protection scrutiny under the compelling state interest/least drastic means test because no fundamental rights were affected. The court distinguished between plaintiff's proffered ballot access cases and those implicating campaign financing and held that the minimal scrutiny test was appropriate. Plaintiff was not denied equal protection under Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 because Act was reasonably related to legitimate governmental objectives.

The employee had been injured within the scope and course of his employment while unloading one of his employer's vehicles.

The court found that the traditional equal-protection standard required that legislation be sustained if the classification was rationally related to a legitimate public interest. The court further noted that legislation was accorded a presumption of constitutionality and that its inquiry was restricted to the issue of whether any state of facts either known or which could reasonably be assumed afforded support for it. The court recognized that legislation eliminating coverage where the involvement of the motor vehicle did not relate to its character as such had been upheld on the grounds that it appeared that the legislature had attempted to reduce premiums for no-fault insurance by limiting its scope. The court likewise held that &sect; 3106(2) of the No-Fault Act, Mich. Comp.

The court held that sentence review opened up the entire sentence to review to consider whether the sentence was excessively severe or excessively lenient.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an association of manufacturers, appealed from a decision of the Ingham County Circuit Court (Michigan), which dismissed its complaint against defendant state officials. The association alleged that the Logging Industry Compensation Fund provisions of Chapter 5 of the Worker's Disability Compensation Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.501 et seq., were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.501 et seq. created the Fund, out of which logging industry employers were repaid out of a special fund for workers' disability payments. The association argued that the provisions violated the Michigan Constitution in that they unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to a private group, their object was not expressed in the Act's title, and they violated due process and equal protection. The trial court held that the provisions were constitutional, and the court affirmed. The court held that the legislature validly adopted a standard already in existence when it referred to definitions in a manual as the standard by which to determine &quot;employment in the logging industry&quot;; it did not delegate authority to the group that published the manual. Creation of the fund was germane, auxiliary, and incidental to the primary object of the Act and did not need to be expressed in its title. The provisions shielded the logging industry from potentially ruinous workers' compensation rates while providing for workers' benefits and were rationally related to a reasonable legislative objective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder agreed to erect and operate an airplane hangar. The builder filed an action with the tax tribunal appealing the township's assessment of the leased property as personal property for a certain tax year. The builder later amended the petition to include the assessment for a second tax year. The builder argued that the hangar and related facilities were not personal property of the builder, but belonged to the airport; and as the hangar was real property under the lease, the builder was exempt from taxation as a concessionaire pursuant to 1953 Mich. Pub. Acts 189; Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.181 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.7(5)), as amended by 1976 Mich. Pub. Acts 43. The tribunal ruled in the builder's favor and concluded that ownership was vested in the airport. On appeal, the court found that the tribunal's decision was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence. Under the lease the builder was a concessionaire because he sold, rented, and leased aircraft including hangar space and made available and operated aircraft for business, pleasure, and industrial purposes. The court held that the builder's operation met all the tests for a &quot;concession.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Michigan Attorney General appealed an order of the Ingham County Circuit Court (Michigan), which affirmed four rate orders issued by defendant Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) approving certain monthly electric billing adjustments for defendant electric company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MPSC established an Other Operations and Maintenance Expense Indexing System. Pursuant to this indexing system, the MPSC granted four annual rate increases to the electric company. The trial court affirmed the orders approving the rate increases. On appeal, the Attorney General argued that the MPSC did not act lawfully and reasonably in granting four annual rate increases to the electric company and that the establishment of the Other Operations and Maintenance Expense Indexing System was beyond the MPSC's authority. In affirming the trial court, the court concluded that the establishment of the Other Operations and Maintenance Expense Indexing System fell within the MPSC's broad discretion and statutory authority under the Public Service Commission Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.6. The purpose of the indexing system was to regulate the rise in other operations and maintenance expenses and to provide an incentive for the electric company to keep these expenses below the consumer price index. The system falls within the Public Service Commission Act charge that the MPSC regulate all charges related to the operation of a public utility.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers had filed the action in their individual capacities and as a class action on behalf of all parties paying property taxes in the county. The taxpayers requested that the commission's actions in equalizing tax assessments be declared illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought a writ of mandamus to compel defendants to properly calculate the equalization factor. The trial court concluded that all the taxpayers' claims were within the jurisdiction of the state tax tribunal or were claims that the taxpayers lacked standing to assert. On appeal, the court held that to the extent that the taxpayers' complaint could be read to assert a dispute as to their individual property tax assessments including the effect thereon of the equalization process, the trial court was without jurisdiction. The court noted that a party who was previously entitled to proceed before the commission or trial court for review of such decisions had to proceed before the tax tribunal pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.741. The court noted that the taxpayers claimed that the use of improper data by defendants produced a result that contravened constitutional provisions. The court ruled that resolution of that issue required not a determination of constitutional issues, but rather an inquiry as to the validity of the &quot;sales ratio study&quot;, a factual determination particularly within the expertise of the tax tribunal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff declared a jail overcrowding state of emergency pursuant to the county jail overcrowding act. The act set forth a procedure for reducing the prisoner population of county jails. The prosecutor brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the act unconstitutionally contravened the governor's exclusive commutation power under Mich. Const. art. 5, &sect; 14 (1963). The defender was permitted to intervene. The trial court held the act constitutional. The prosecutor sought review and the court reversed. The court noted that the act was a counterpart to the Prison Overcrowding Emergency Powers Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 800.71 et seq., which authorized the reduction of the minimum sentences of prisoners incarcerated in state prisons where overcrowding existed. The court acknowledged that this act had been upheld. However, the court distinguished the decision upholding the state prisons act from the current controversy because the state prisons act applied only to prisoners serving indeterminate sentences. Because the county jail act applied to prisoners serving determinate sentences, the court held that it infringed on the governor's exclusive power of commutation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant slipped and fell on ice cream on the floor of the terminal building. The trial court reasoned that the airport enjoyed governmental immunity under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 259.132 (Mich. Ann. Stat. &sect; 10.232). The court reversed and remanded. The operational portion of &sect; 259.132 referred solely to the acquisition of lands for airport purposes; it was not designed to cloak an airport with governmental immunity. The Michigan Supreme Court was unable to frame a comprehensive formula to determine when immunity applied, the common-law doctrine of governmental immunity having been abrogated. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1413 (Mich. Ann. Stat. &sect; 3.996(113) incorporated the common-law concept of governmental versus proprietary function which, while never used by the courts, was never declared unconstitutional. The court noted that the operation of bus and streetcar companies was considered a proprietary function, operations in which the profit element was more frequently lacking than in airport operations. Under the facts of this case only, the operation of a municipal airport was a proprietary function and, by statutory definition, not entitled to governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the statute clearly established sanctions for conduct, as opposed to pure speech, and that it was not directed at the restriction of the communication of thoughts or ideas, but aimed at the regulation of the malicious use of communicative services. The court ruled that the focus was on the malicious intent of the caller when the transmission was made. The court found that there was no substantial overbreadth problem given the substantial interest of the state in protecting the privacy of citizens from unwanted intrusions and the limiting requirements of the statute. The court held that the words employed in the statute were sufficient to provide defendant with fair notice of the conduct, which was proscribed.

The trial court held a hearing and determined she was responsible for $ 72,500 of the employer's losses. Upon review, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. It found that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider defendant's financial resources and her ability to pay back the $ 72,500. Further, there was no overwhelming support for the trial court's conclusion that defendant was responsible for the employer's additional losses. The evidence was not persuasive that $ 72,500 was embezzled or that defendant was the one who embezzled it. The court was troubled by the trial court's treatment of defendant's refusal to testify at the sentencing hearing as evidence that she embezzled the additional money from her employer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the corporation's initial complaint filed on June 26, 1979, it sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief as redress for defendants' allegedly unconstitutional safety inspection of its premises. On May 19, 1981, the corporation filed a suit in federal court seeking money damages for deprivation of its civil rights. In the state action, the trial court found no useful purpose would be served by permitting the case to continue and dismissed the case. The corporation filed a motion to reinstate the cause, which was denied. The federal court held that the state court action was res judicata against defendants. Upon review, the court found that the trial court was justified in dismissing the corporation's case for lack of progress. Rather than appeal the trial court's denial of its motion to amend its complaint, the corporation chose to pursue a federal action against defendants. The fact that the federal court found that the dismissal of the state case with prejudice was res judicata was not a reason in and of itself to reinstate the corporation's action. The corporation failed to present any evidence that justified its lack of reasonable diligence.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court concluded that the PRA was unconstitutional because it applied to only three penal institutions and violated equal protection. The court upheld the circuit court's decision. The court did not decide whether heightened scrutiny applied because the PRA failed even the rational basis test. The PRA had no reasonable basis and was essentially arbitrary. The PRA clearly limited itself to the three state penal institutions that were extant at the time it was enacted. The PRA thus created an unreasonable and arbitrary classification which did not serve the purpose of the statute to provide for reimbursement where former prisoners had estates capable of reimbursement, Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was employed by the employer, the state police department, and became upset with the fact that many other employees were not following specifically mandated procedures. His complaints went unnoticed and the employee eventually blew the whistle by going to the press, which printed three stories accordingly. The employee was fired by the employer for insubordination and the Department allowed the suspension to continue until such time as the employee retracted the statements he made. The employee refused to do so and instead appealed the Department's ruling. On appeal, the court found the suspension and ordered retraction inappropriate because the statements made by the employee were protected by the First Amendment. The employee had no legal obligation to make a retraction and could not have been required, as a condition of continuing employment, to waive his First Amendment rights. The Department was presented with no evidence to support the conclusion that employee made the statements knowing them to be false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not they were true. Thus, reinstatement was affirmed but the interest award was deemed improper.</SPAN></P>

The customers contended that distribution of the recovery should be allowed according to the fluid recovery format and that they were entitled to an attorney fee award. The sales outlets argued that the law of the case doctrine peremptorily disposed of the fluid recovery issue. The court affirmed the trial court, refusing to invoke the fluid recovery method. The propriety of a fluid recovery had not been an issue in a previous appeal of the case. However, in considering the method, the court found that justification of the fluid recovery would have been for its deterrent value, and the trial court had determined that the sales outlets had used the previous balance method in good faith belief that it was legal in the state.

Finding no constitutional deprivation in either instance, the court held that the legislature's purpose in providing the classification of guilty but mentally ill was not nullified by the treatment made available under &sect; 330.2001 et seq. because there was an automatic entitlement to evaluation and treatment under the new classification.

The court affirmed the lower court's order. Contrary to defendant's claim, the ordinance in question was not repealed upon amendment to the Township Rural Zoning Act by 1978 Mich. Pub.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Department of Education and superintendent, appealed from a finding of the trial court (Michigan) that state laws which required certification of teachers in nonpublic schools, and mandated certain courses and curriculum standards in such schools, violated the rights of plaintiffs, church and its employees, to freely exercise their religious beliefs under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature placed supervision of nonpublic schools within the authority of the superintendent. The church filed an action claiming that the laws violated its right to freely exercise their religious beliefs and prayed for an injunction enjoining enforcement. The trial judge agreed and held that the teacher certification requirement and state supervision of parochial schools caused excessive government entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the curriculum and teacher certification regulations were a reasonable exercise of state authority in providing quality education to children. There was no showing that compliance with the requirements would render the mission of their parochial schools impractical or impossible. The court found that the teacher certification and curriculum requirements involved permissible state contacts with the religious schools. In addition, the court noted that the state could use statistical data gathered from the church in the same manner that such data were used from the public schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church emphasized public proselytizing and solicitation of funds to support church activities. The fund-raising endeavors ultimately piqued the interest of the department, which believed that church members might be engaged in retail sales. The department issued a notice of intent to assess sales tax against the church and the church appealed the assessment to the board claiming that it had not engaged in retail sales. The board affirmed the assessments on the ground that the church failed to meet its burden of proving that its had not engaged in taxable sales. The court reversed the board's decision because it was not supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. The court found that the church met its burden of proving that it was not making taxable sales by showing that its members used the distribution of low-cost articles to facilitate the solicitation of funds to raise money for the church, which the department conceded was a bona fide religious organization. The court was persuaded that the church transactions were not retail sales, but rather were distributions of personal property incidental to the solicitation of contributions.</SPAN></P>

The members contended that &sect; 45.514(d)(ii) was a special act because it pertained only to counties with the specified population; thus it was invalid because it had not been approved by both houses of the legislature. The court held that: (1) the fact that &sect; 45.514(d)(ii) contained a population classification which limited its geographical application did not make it a special or local act because the classification had a reasonable relation to the purpose of the statute, namely the organization of county government; (2) &sect; 45.514(d)(ii) specifically provided that in counties of more than 1,500,000 the CEO had authority to appoint and remove members, thus satisfying the &quot;unless otherwise specifically provided&quot; provision of the CEO's appointment authority under &sect; 4.385 of the county's home-rule charter; and (3) the CEO's appointment power was not vitiated by the general provisions of a statute enacted simultaneously with a specific statute on the CEO's appointment power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners and defendant municipalities both sought review of the judgment of the Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan), which struck down the one percent collection fee on property taxes voluntarily paid contained in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.44 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.87) as violative of Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 (1963) but denied certification as a class under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 208.1(3) (1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners paid local real estate taxes. Under the challenged law, each municipality imposed a collection fee on the taxpayer added to the amount of the tax due. The property owners challenged the collection fee on equal protection grounds. The trial court denied the property owners' motion for certification as a class, but held that the collection fee was constitutionally invalid. The court limited the property owners' recovery to only those fees paid since institution of the action. On cross-appeal, the court affirmed the judgment holding the collection fee unconstitutional but modified the order. The court held that there were no distinguishing characteristics to separate the taxpayers in regard to the cost of collecting taxes, that disparate fees did not bear any reasonable relationship to the actual costs of collection, and that taxpayers in the same class were not treated alike but were separated according to the sum of taxes owed, which was an unreasonable and arbitrary distinction. Class certification was properly denied because it would have necessitated an adjournment at a late date. Finally, recovery was properly only limited by the six-year limitations period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that the collection fee collected by the municipalities from the property owners violated the equal protection clause of the Michigan constitution and affirmed the judgment that the property owners were not entitled to class certification. The court modified the order to allow the property owners to recover the fees paid for the first six years prior to the institution of the action along with fees paid since.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father voluntarily executed a release of parental rights as to his three children. Twenty-two days later, the father filed a petition for a hearing to revoke the release. The child placing agency refused to join or acquiesce in the petition.

On appeal, the court held that the release and revocation provisions of the Michigan Adoption Code did not violate the Due Process Clause because the 20-day limit on the right of a parent acting without the support of a child placing agency to attempt to revoke a release was reasonably related to preserving the finality of decisions to release children for adoption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landfill operator challenged defendant township's zoning ordinance, which prevented construction of a landfill. The circuit court (Michigan) found the zoning ordinance unconstitutional, and restrained the township from any further interference with construction of the landfill. The township's motions for a new trial and an injunction restraining construction until the adoption of a new ordinance were denied, and it appealed as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning case concerned construction of a landfill on property within the township. The circuit court concluded that the zoning ordinance totally excluded landfills from the township, and that this exclusion bore no reasonable relationship to the health, safety, or general welfare of the community. The court agreed, but the finding that the total exclusion of landfills was unreasonable did not end the inquiry. In addition to such a showing, the landfill operator was also required to prove that exclusion of a landfill from its particular parcel of property was not reasonably related to the health, safety, or general welfare of the community. The landfill operator had to show that the zoning ordinance was invalid as applied to it. There was uncontroverted evidence that the site was geologically suitable, and the township introduced no evidence indicating that a landfill posed health or safety risks, or interfere in any way with the agricultural use of nearby property. Testimony regarding future development in the vicinity was speculative and unconvincing. In light of the degree of state regulation of landfills, there was no significant void of regulation necessitating remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that the zoning ordinance was invalid. The court also affirmed the determination that the township failed to show that the proposed landfill violated the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 or the Junkyard Control Act.</SPAN></P>

A witness testified that defendant was the driver of the car, however, later admitted that her testimony was untrue and that defendant had asked her to testify as she did. Defendant denied he asked the witness to lie. Defendant claimed that due to vagueness in the subornation of perjury statute, there was no proper notice of what conduct was prohibited thus violating his right to due process, and that such vagueness allowed arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court affirmed the conviction. A statute was not vague when the meaning of the words in controversy could be fairly ascertained or if they possessed a common and generally accepted meaning. The meaning of the word subornation was sufficiently clear when the statutory language which followed it informed a person that he should not procure another to commit the crime of perjury. The trial court defined the terms subornation and procure and allowed counsel to argue the meaning of the terms. The subornation of perjury statute would not be found to be overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After stopping a car in which defendant was riding, a deputy sheriff was prevented from giving the driver field sobriety tests by an intoxicated defendant's abusive language. After arresting the driver for driving under the influence of liquor, the deputy unsuccessfully asked defendant for identification and sought to impound the vehicle. After defendant became profane and argumentative, the deputy arrested defendant for being a disorderly person. The circuit court reversed defendant's conviction by holding that the public disturbance provision of the disorderly person statute was unconstitutionally vague. On the State's appeal to contest the circuit court's finding as to the unconstitutionality of the disorderly person statute, the court affirmed defendant's particular challenge to the statute as void for vagueness. To avoid striking down the statute as unconstitutional, the court construed the public disturbance provision of the disorderly person statute to require a finding that an accused, while intoxicated, directly endangered the safety of another person or of property as requisite to a finding of guilty of causing a public disturbance while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reviewed the reports of defendant's mental condition, determined he was mentally ill at the time of the offense, and accepted the plea of guilty but mentally ill.

The court found that defendant was informed of the charge against him and found that it was proper for the prosecutor to read the information in the judge's presence at the plea taking. The court further found that the trial judge properly informed defendant of his right to compulsory process of witnesses, and the record reflected sufficient questioning of defendant regarding the voluntariness of his plea.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged jointly with two counts of child cruelty for the treatment of the female defendant's two children, and one count of torturing a child. The district court ordered both defendants bound on the cruelty count but refused to bind defendants over on the torture count. The district court found that the child torture statute, found in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.136a, was impermissibly vague. The circuit court affirmed, finding that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the torture statute did not define the word &quot;torture,&quot; thus it was to be given its ordinary meaning. The court interpreted the statute to require a showing that defendant intentional inflicted extreme, intense or sever pain or injury upon the victim. The court further found that the term &quot;torture&quot; had a commonly understood meaning, which gave a person fair notice that his conduct was forbidden. The court found that when the male defendant pleaded guilty to the cruelty charged he waived his right to be tried in a single trial.

Laws &sect; 333.18201 et seq., in their action against defendants, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulation, the Department's director, and the state psychology board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school psychologists held masters degrees in psychology and possessed limited licenses that allowed them to practice school psychology in the course of their employment with a school. As the school psychologists did not hold doctoral degrees, they were not permitted to secure a license to practice psychology outside of the public or private elementary or secondary school setting. The school psychologists unsuccessfully claimed that the statutory restriction of their practice of psychology to a school setting violated their due process and equal protection rights. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment against the school psychologists by finding that, as the regulation of the practice of psychology was properly within the state's police power, the limitation of the psychologists with masters degrees to the practice of school psychology in the course of their employment with a school district was rationally related to the legitimate state objective of assuring the supervision and accountability of the school psychologists in a team setting. The restriction of the school psychologists' practice did not violate due process or deny equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state highway department sought review of a decision that found unconstitutional a five percent statutory interest provision, from the time of judgment, of the court of claims (Michigan). Appellees, an injured party and his parents, sought review of an order that denied them pre-judgment interest on a personal injury damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was paralyzed in a car accident. He and his parents brought an action against the department to recover personal injury and emotional distress damages. The trial court held for the injured party and his parents. They then filed a motion for both pre- and post-judgment interest at a rate of 12 percent, arguing that the statutory 5 percent interest rate for claims against the department was unconstitutional. The trial court agreed, but awarded only post-judgment interest. The department sought review, and the court reversed both the judgment and the interest award. First, the court held that the parents were not entitled to recover emotional distress damages because they were neither present at the scene of the accident nor saw their son relatively contemporaneously therewith. Second, the court held that the statutory interest rate did not violate equal protection because the provision was not so harsh as to have divested the injured party of access to the courts. Nor, the court said, did the classification lack a reasonable basis. The department had a legitimate interest in limiting the award, the court determined, and the interest rate was procedural.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that found the court of claims' five percent statutory interest provision was unconstitutional. Therefore, it held that the injured party's interest on a personal injury damages award against the department should have been calculated at five percent from the date of the award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The royalty holders leased mineral rights in oil wells owned and operated by the petroleum company, which deducted a pro-rata share of the state severance tax on oil and gas from the royalty interests. The leases were silent regarding the petroleum company's authority to withhold and deduct such taxes from the royalties. The trial court ruled that the severance tax statute defined the royalty holders as producers and as such they were required to pay their proportionate share of the severance tax. On appeal, the court noted that an interpretation by the attorney general of the severance tax statute concluded that payment of severance taxes was the primary responsibility of producers of oil and gas, not of holders of royalty interests. A later amendment to the severance tax act was a reaction to that opinion, and the amended statute made the payment of the severance tax the responsibility of all producers, including holders of royalty interests.</SPAN></P>

The court did not review the trial court's denial of a motion to sever on different grounds than were raised at trial. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the first defendant from impeaching the complainant with evidence of her alleged history of drug use and psychiatric problems on grounds of relevancy and in suppressing evidence of her convictions that fell outside the ten-year period provided in Mich. R. Evid. 609(b). The court found that the jury had legitimate power to render logically inconsistent verdicts by convicting the second defendant of a lesser included offense under an aiding and abetting theory while convicting the first defendant of the charged offense. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, but it set aside the second defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing because the trial court made an independent finding of his guilt on a charge for which he was not convicted.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 168.961.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitions' reasons for recall stated that the officers had a spend and tax mentality, containing a statement that the officers failed to follow campaign promises to give open, clean, honest, and efficient government, and to serve and to administer the township efficiently and remain within a budget. Affirming, the court said that the number of valid signatures did not meet statutory requirements. Under &sect; 168.961, signatures on a petition obtained over 90 days before the petition was filed were invalid. The loose system of dating used invited fraud. Some circulators dated the signatures before circulating, some after. Absent that requirement, an accurate factual determination of a signature's date could have been impossible. The provision was constitutionally permissible. The reasons stated for the recall were sufficiently clear as a whole. In reviewing the reasons, the court read the statement as a whole and did not focus on the individual phrases. Insufficient clarity in spots did not doom a petition where, read as a whole, a sufficiently clear statement was presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Department of Social Services and associated individuals and entities, appealed a judgment of the circuit court (Michigan), which enjoined defendants from continuing to house mentally ill persons in small adult foster care group homes of six or fewer persons in plaintiff township. The township filed a cross-appeal challenging the trial court's rejection of the remainder of its claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the Adult Foster Care Facility Licensing Act (AFCFLA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 400.701 et seq., prohibited the placement of mentally ill persons in small group homes. The court reversed that holding for the reasons expressed in a prior case. The court found that the legislative history did not support the conclusion that the legislature intended to define the &quot;emotionally disturbed&quot; differently from the &quot;mentally ill.&quot; The court affirmed the trial court's judgment rejecting the remainder of the township's claims. Section 16a of the Township Rural Zoning Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.286a(2), which provided an exemption from zoning ordinances to state licensed residential facilities, did not unconstitutionally divest the township of any inherent zoning authority. The enactment of the AFCFLA did not dispense with or change Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.286a so as to violate Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 25 (1963). The township did not demonstrate that the facilities would, by virtue of their allegedly &quot;exorbitant&quot; number, overburden the community's resources or cause undue harm to its population, and thus failed to demonstrate excessive concentration within its borders.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 600.6013(2) on their tort award rather than the five percent interest mandated by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6455.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action against the State alleging that a fatal accident was caused by the State's breach of statutory duties. The State did not appeal the judgment in the amount of $ 432,487, with postjudgment interest computed at five percent pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6455. Plaintiffs then moved for assessment of 12 percent postjudgment interest in accordance with Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6013(2). The trial court granted the motion, concluding that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6455 violated equal protection because it discriminated against victims of governmental tortfeasors. On appeal, the court concluded that the Michigan Legislature intended to put victims of negligent highway maintenance on an equal footing with victims of private tortfeasors with respect to substantive rights of recovery but not with respect to certain procedural requirements. Postjudgment interest was not a substantive element of plaintiffs' recovery. Plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that the statute bore no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. The limitation on interest liability allowed the State to defend against tort actions at a reduced level of economic risk.</SPAN></P>

On five occasions the company came before the commission requesting authorization to issue unsecured notes.

The company filed an application objecting to the assessment and filing requirement, denying the commission's jurisdiction. The hearing officer recommended that the commission disclaim jurisdiction, but the commission issued an order asserting jurisdiction. The company appealed and the court consolidated the five prior cases. The commission based its jurisdiction on Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.301(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22.101(1)). The court identified the law's basic interests as protecting investors and ratepayers. The court held that in balancing the state's interests against the adverse effects to interstate commerce, applying the law to the company unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce; therefore, the commission had no constitutional right to exercise jurisdiction over the company and the order asserting jurisdiction was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testimony established that defendant was in possession of a loaded .38 caliber revolver during the commission of a narcotics felony. The weapon, however, was not test fired to determine whether it was functional. Defendant's motion to quash was decided on appeal adversely to defendant. Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin and felony-firearm. Defendant contended that the weapon did not fall within the provisions of the felony-firearm statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b. He claimed that the prosecutor did not prove that the weapon was operable and thus did not establish that it fit within the firearm definition of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 8.3t. The court held that proof of operability of the weapon was not needed to include it within the prohibitions of the felony-firearm statute. The legislature clearly intended the statute to discourage carrying guns, whether operable or not. The statute had a very broad deterrent purpose. The statute was intended to protect the victim, who would have been no less frightened if the gun, most likely unknown to him, just happened to be inoperable.</SPAN></P>

The muffler installer also claimed that the trial court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings and erroneously instructed the jury.

Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1411(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.996(111)(2)) to the nuisance claim because a claim of intentional nuisance is subject to the three-year, rather than the two-year, statute of limitations. The court found that the victim had sufficiently plead her claim based on intentional nuisance because the complaint contained allegations that the city allowed the dangerous and hazardous condition to exist and &quot;refused&quot; to take any steps to remedy the same. The court held that the term &quot;refused&quot; when liberally construed described an alleged deliberate act by the governmental agency to create the complained-of condition and was sufficient to withstand dismissal by accelerated judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the trial court judgment that granted the city's motion for accelerated judgment as to the accident victim's negligence claim and reversed the part that granted accelerated judgment as to the victim's intentional nuisance claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The insurance companies sought a declaratory judgment, from which the Commissioner appealed. The court found that an conflict between the constitution and the statutory requirement of an independent hearing officer was superficial. The court found that the Civil Service Commission possessed the authority to provide for contractual personal services, and had the right to approve or disapprove disbursements for all personal services. The court held that the independent hearing officers envisaged by Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, former employers and their respective insurance carriers, appealed from an order of the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board, which reversed a referee's order, and ruled that appellee deceased employee sustained a work-related injury or disability such that appellee widow was entitled to payments under the Workers' Disability Compensation Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.40 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.237(401) et seq.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that the deceased was a cook for the employers. He died after suffering his fifth heart attack. He worked mainly in one employer's kitchen, where he was required to stand, lift heavy objects, and was subjected to extreme heat. He worked part-time for the other employers. The board ruled that the widow was entitled to compensation under the Act because the stressful effects of the deceased's employment aggravated his heart condition, and apportioned payment among the employers. The deceased's primary employer argued that the board erred in ordering payments because the deceased's work for his son's restaurant caused the heart attack. On appeal, the court ruled that the board's ruling was supported by the facts, which showed that the deceased only assisted his son in establishing the business, and was not entitled to compensation or discipline from the son. The court further held that an amendment, which restricted a workers' right to compensation for heart conditions under the Act, was not to be applied retroactively. The court ruled, however, that because there was no evidence showing the working conditions of the part-time employers, apportionment was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the board's judgment in favor of the widow as against the deceased's primary employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state highway department issued a state permit for the construction of a billboard.

The township filed a complaint, claiming that the advertising company did not obtain local building permits or site plan approval as required by local zoning ordinances. In reversing and remanding the judgment that was partially in favor of the township and partially in favor to the advertising company, the court noted that under the Township Rural Zoning Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.271 (Mich. Stat.

The court adopted a reasonableness exception to the uniformity requirement of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.271 (Mich. Stat.

The advertising company appealed from that portion of the trial court's decision, which found that the Act did not pre-empt the township's ability to require minimum setback distances within adjacent areas. The township cross-appealed from that part of the order, which found that the advertising company had standing to contest the denial of its permit, and that the off-premises sign ordinance was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that the Act did not pre-empt local governments from regulating areas unrelated to the spacing, lighting, and size of signs in adjacent areas. The court further held, that the advertising company had a sufficient interest in the outcome of the litigation to have assured sincere and vigorous advocacy, and that the trial court's decision as to the invalidity of the township's off-premises ordinance was proper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of breaking and entering with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct and first degree criminal sexual conduct following a jury trial, and he appealed as of right alleging various points of error. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that police testimony was properly admitted although her notes were discarded, as the police report was not admitted and the notes were not destroyed in bad faith. Additionally, the victim's trial identification of defendant was proper even though no counsel was present when he was first identified, as on-the-scene identification did not always entitle a defendant to counsel. Moreover, the fact that two previous trials ended in mistrial due to prosecutorial error was irrelevant. The trial judge erred in allowing a hearsay statement of the victim identifying defendant as an excited utterance as it was made 40 minutes after the attack; however, the evidence was cumulative. Finally, the statutory term &quot;mental anguish&quot; was not impermissibly vague, and defendant was not exposed to double jeopardy, as breaking and entering was a separate offense and it was not the aggravating factor that elevated the other offense.</SPAN></P>

The insurer filed a counterclaim seeking reimbursement in the amount received by the husband under a workers' compensation redemption. The trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for accelerated judgment or for summary judgment on the counterclaim and denied a request for a rehearing. Plaintiffs argued that the trial court improperly applied a new rule of substantive law retroactively. The insurer argued that in ruling that &sect; 3109(1) (Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3109(1)) of the Michigan No-Fault Insurance Act was constitutional, the Michigan Supreme Court did not announce a new rule of law, but rather held that the rule of law established by the legislature was not unconstitutional. The court held that at the time the no-fault benefits were paid, the insurer was entitled to subtract duplicative workers' compensation benefits. The authority to dictate the limited applicability of a Michigan Supreme Court decision upholding a statute's constitutionality lay with the Michigan Supreme Court, and the Michigan Supreme Court did not provide for the limited applicability of its decisions upholding the constitutionality of &sect; 3109(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company provided unemployment compensation cost control services to employers. An action against the company and its employee resulted in a consent judgment permanently enjoining them from representing clients in proceedings under the Michigan Employment Security Act (MESA), Mich.

The trial court denied defendants' motion to lift the injunction, holding that while an amendment to &sect; 31 of MESA, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 421.31 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.533), permitted nonattorneys to represent employers in MESC proceedings, the company was precluded from doing so because corporations were prohibited from practicing law. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 31 of MESA, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 421.31 (Mich. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was bound over for trial on the offense of possession of cocaine in excess of 650 grams. Defendant filed a motion to quash the information. The trial court granted the motion, finding that the mandatory life sentence prescribed for the offense was a denial of due process and equal protection of the law. The trial court also found that since the life sentence shocked the judicial conscience, it constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, the trial court found that the classification of cocaine with other &quot;hard drugs&quot; was without rational basis. The prosecutor appealed. The court reversed, holding that the statutory scheme that placed cocaine in Schedule 2 for penalty purposes did not violate defendant's due process of equal protection rights under the United States and Michigan Constitutions. The court explained that there was enormous profit from illegal cocaine traffic and that there was a strong correlation with the use of cocaine and the use of &quot;hard drugs.&quot; The court also cited the potential harm to the user inherent in the illegal use of cocaine. Thus, the graduated punishment scheme achieved the legislative policies underlying criminal penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient initiated a medical malpractice action against defendants, and defendants filed motions for accelerated judgment, alleging that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because of an arbitration agreement signed by the patient. The trial court granted defendants' motions, and the patient appealed. The patient argued that the medical malpractice arbitration act (act), Mich. Comp.

The court reversed the trial court's judgment.

Sufficient factual basis was elicited at his guilty plea because when defendant admitted to transporting the woman for prostitution, a reasonable jury could have drawn an inculpatory inference and convicted defendant.

The circuit court reversed the board of review, and MESC appealed. The court reversed the judgment and reinstated the decision of the MESC to deny unemployment compensation, holding that the word &quot;employer&quot; in &sect; 421.29(5) referred only to Michigan employers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees sought review of the holdings of three trial courts (Michigan) that the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 37.2101 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.548(101) et seq.), was unconstitutional owing to the single object clause of Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24 (1963) and the trial courts' holdings that the clause was violated by the arrest record and polygraph provisions of the Act as nongermane to the Act's object.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In each of the instant cases, the trial court held that the provisions of the Act that were found to violate the state constitutional's single object clause were not severable and thus the entire Act was required to be invalidated. The court disagreed and, declining to affirm a finding of unconstitutionality, reasoned that the dicta in one state supreme court case could not impose a per se rule against severability when such a rule was not supported by other well known and long accepted purposes of the constitutional provision. Neither did the application of such a per se rule against severability promote the purpose of the clause when applied to later enacted amendments. Expressing its belief in the legislature's correctness in determining that the goal of promoting civil rights of disadvantaged persons would be advanced by disallowing the examination of an applicant's arrest without conviction record, the court concluded that the Act was constitutionally valid. Moreover, the arrest record provision would have required a reference to the Act if it had been included in a different statute in order for the state civil rights commission to enforce it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed summary judgment in defendant employers' favor in all three cases and remanded the causes for further proceedings, with costs to the employees.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 431.61-431.88. A declaratory judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff and the Commissioner. The race track owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Racing Law of 1980 was passed, the horse owner association initiated an action for declaratory and injunctive relief as to interpretation of the statute. When the trial court entered judgment in favor of the horse owner association and the Commissioner, the race track owners appealed. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 431.69 gave the Commissioner the authority to: (1) grant or deny each application for a particular form of race meeting license and (2) allocate or deny racing dates for which application has been made. In interpreting the statute, the court noted that its meaning was clear and the every word and phrase of the statute was to be given meaning and not treated as mere surplusage or rendered nugatory. Further, Mich. Const. of 1963, art 3, &sect; 2 required that the court not usurp legislative power. Because the Commissioner's power to allocate racing dates was limited, he could not compel a licensee to conduct races on dates for which application has not been made.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 600.3801 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.3801), in that it was being used for the purpose of assignation or prostitution, or, for the use of prostitutes. The trial court entered an order enjoining defendant landlords from operating the premises for those purposes and ordered the building closed. The landlords appealed as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several times undercover officers had gone onto the landlords' premises and the women of the massage parlor had solicited sexual activity in return for money. The state brought the instant action against the landlords of the premises alleging that it was a nuisance. Although the term prostitution, as used in the public nuisance abatement statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.3801 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.3801), had not been defined, the court concluded that the complained-of acts were included within the proscriptions of the statute and that defendants were afforded fair notice of the same. Further the court found that the commercial nature of the activity coupled with the fact that it took place between unmarried individuals, clearly took it outside the scope of the constitutional protections for privacy. Additionally, the court found that the speech incident to assignation for prostitution was essentially commercial in nature and intended solely for the purpose of selling a product. The statute directly advanced an important state interest without unnecessarily restricting other protected activities. Thus, there was no First Amendment violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding the landlords in violation of the public nuisance abatement statute was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to one of the provisions of the fishermen's license, the state conservation officers had the authority to inspect the fishermen's vessels as well as any other property used in carrying on the fishermen's operation. After the fishermen refused to allow the inspections, the Department suspended their licenses. On appeal, the court upheld the suspensions, finding that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 300.12 authorized the officers to search commercial fishing vessels without a warrant provided that they had probable cause to believe that the conservation laws were being violated. Thus, both probable cause and exigent circumstances were required to conduct a warrantless inspection. The court found that the officer's observation of trap nets lying on the deck of the fishermen's boat furnished the officers with the requisite probable cause to inspect the boat for evidence of illegal trap nets. Because the net traps could have been slipped into the water upon entry into the port, exigent circumstances existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the school district refused to admit their child for band instruction because she attended a private school, the parents filed a complaint seeking an injunction, which was dismissed by the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the school district might have permissibly declined to offer any shared time instruction whatsoever; however once it chose to offer such instruction, participation might not have depended upon the particular religious or personal convictions of the individual student. The court held that the school district had developed and implemented a policy of nonadmission to its courses to any but full-time resident students and had administered its policy on a consistent and evenhanded basis. The court held that the school district did not deny the child admission to its band class because of her religious beliefs and the policy did not deny the child the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Mich. Const. of 1963 art. I, &sect; 4, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that band instruction could not have been construed to be an auxiliary service under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 380.1296 (Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board adopted an accommodation tax ordinance pursuant to authority granted under Mich. Comp.

Under this ordinance, a four percent excise tax was levied on the revenue derived from the rental of motel and hotel accommodations to transient guests in the county. Plaintiffs filed an action challenging the ordinance. Plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction restraining defendants from levying the tax prior to a final judicial determination of its validity. The trial court denied plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. The court affirmed the trial court's order. The accommodations tax ordinance and its enabling statute did not violate the four percent limitation on sales taxes set forth in Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 8 (1963) because neither the accommodation tax nor the Use Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205,93a(b) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.555(3a)(b)) were sales taxes.

The court held that facilities housing six or fewer persons for adult foster care did not need to obtain local zoning approval and that this rule did not result in unconstitutional divestiture of the city's inherent zoning authority. The court further held that amendment of the act establishing the enabling authority for municipal adoption of zoning ordinances to include a substantive provision exempting state licensed residential facilities from zoning ordinances did not violate the single-object clause of the state constitution where the amendment was not unconnected with the act's object.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department denied the taxpayer's claim for an intangibles tax refund. The taxpayer petitioned the tax tribunal for review of the department's denial of his refund claim. The tax tribunal adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the proposed judgment. The court affirmed the tax tribunal's judgment. The court determined that there was no violation of Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 7 because the intangibles tax did not constitute an income tax. The court concluded that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.133(b)(12) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.556(3)(b)(12)) did not exempt a person from intangibles liability simply because he engaged in a business activity. The court explained that &sect; 3(b)(12) stated that the intangibles tax did not apply to certain intangible personal property if income from such property was used in computation of business income for purposes of the single business tax. The court concluded that the definition of income found in the intangibles tax act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.131 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.556(1) et seq.), and the administrative rules clearly included dividends of the type involved in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, on appeal from their drug-related convictions, contended that an essential element of delivery of cocaine was proof that the substance delivered was not a synthetic product and that, absent such proof, they could not be convicted of delivering a schedule 2 controlled substance under Mich.

The court held that &sect; 333.7214(a) clearly included substances produced independently by means of chemical synthesis and that the weight classifications found in Mich. Comp.

The record reflected that the employee, who was employed as an attendant nurse at a development center, sustained injuries when assaulted by a patient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately two weeks after the injury, the Department started paying the employee's workers' compensation benefits and statutory supplemental benefits. When the employee's workers' compensation benefits were terminated, she filed a petition for a hearing with the Bureau of Workers' Disability Compensation. A hearing referee held that the employee was psychiatrically disabled and ordered that the Department pay the employee's workers' compensation benefits until further order. An appeal of this order was pending. Shortly after the hearing, the Department discontinued the employee's supplemental benefits. The employee was terminated on March 3, 1981. Defendants asserted supplemental benefits should not be awarded because, among other things, the employee failed to exhaust her available remedies under the collective-bargaining agreement. The court held that: (1) where supplemental benefits were provided for by statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 330.1113, the employee did not have to exhaust her grievance remedies under the collective-bargaining agreement; and (2) the employee was not precluded from receiving benefits for the period she was on the payroll.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, pentazocine. Defendant appealed, claiming that because the legislature never declared that possession of pentazocine was a crime, the statutory provision granting power to the pharmacy board to classify controlled substances constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency. Thus, defendant claimed he was entitled to reversal of his conviction. The court ruled that the legislature's delegation of the decision of determining whether a particular drug was a controlled substance to the pharmacy board was not per se unlawful simply because the controlled substance provision of the health code was penal in nature. The court concluded that the pharmacy board was required to possess a high level of expertise and to follow reasonably precise standards under the public health code when determining whether to classify a drug as a controlled substance. Thus, the standards employed by the legislature to govern the pharmacy board's exercise of the power granted to it by the legislature were sufficiently definite to satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process and separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the child argued that the trial court erred in its dismissal of the negligence and false imprisonment claims. The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed in part, and remanded the action. In doing so, the court held that the negligence claim was properly dismissed because the child failed to allege facts avoiding the application of governmental immunity as the operation of the state institutions was a governmental function. The court reinstated the false imprisonment claim after resolving an apparent conflict in the Michigan courts regarding whether there was governmental immunity for intentional torts by adopting a test that would have granted governmental immunity where the employee's actions were justified under the particular case's circumstances.The court affirmed the denial of summary judgment on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim by rejecting the State's argument that a state was not a &quot;person&quot; under the statute.</SPAN></P>

On further review, the court determined that the commissioner's findings were supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence. The court also ruled that Mich. Admin.

Noting that plaintiff had a right under &sect; 92 of the Administrative Procedures Act to an informal compliance hearing before formal revocation proceedings were initiated, the court determined that plaintiff did not make a claim for such a hearing until the time of appeal and thus waived the claim.

The applicants appealed, and the circuit court entered an order finding the rule an unconstitutional delegation of the Commission's power and remanding the application to the Commission for further consideration.

In a prior opinion, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutional on its face and that the secretary of state could collect the fees imposed, but had to place them in escrow until the legislature amended the statute to assure that no more than 10 percent of sums collected from two funds would be distributed for comprehensive transportation purposes consistent with Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 9. The secretary filed an action for mandamus, seeking to have the court determine when the power to collect such special taxes expired. While various related lawsuits were pending, the legislature passed and the governor signed 1982 Mich. Pub. Acts 56, which provided for the continuation of the SEMTA taxes. The court determined that 1982 Mich. Pub. Acts 56 was constitutional and that the funds derived pursuant to the statute had to be spent according to 1967 Mich. Pub. Acts 204.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was admitted to the hospital for the delivery of her son. After the patient and her son were discharged, she filed a malpractice action against defendants. Defendants claimed that the patient had signed two arbitration agreements, and the trial court found that the agreements were properly and knowingly executed. The trial court dismissed the patient's complaint. On appeal, the patient claimed, among other things, that the arbitration agreements were void because their execution failed to comply with statutory requirements. The court noted that the patient had denied that she was ever furnished with an information brochure, which was required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5041(6). The court found that a hospital clerk did not contradict the patient's assertion and that the clerk stated that the brochures were only given if a patient stated that she was unaware of arbitration and if a patient did not sign the requested form. The court held that the trial court's finding that the brochure was furnished to the patient was without any support, and it held that strict compliance with the arbitration statute was necessary.</SPAN></P>

The victim inadvertently cut his penis while zipping his pajamas. When the mother attempted to apply ointment to the wound, defendant interfered. Defendant had the victim lie naked on the bathroom floor while defendant poured rubbing alcohol over the child's penis and groin area. Repeated dousings of alcohol resulted in the formation of scabs and chemical burns on the victim's penis, scrotum, and groin area. There was also evidence of extensive bruising and that an object had been inserted into the victim's rectum. The court affirmed defendant's convictions for first-degree criminal sexual conduct and torture of a child. The court determined that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.136a, the child torture statute, was not unconstitutionally vague. The word torture had a common, ordinary meaning to the extent that &sect; 750.136a furnished adequate notice to defendant that the repeated application of rubbing alcohol to a two-year-old's penis was proscribed conduct.

The incorporator also sought to compel the commissioner to authorize the incorporators to proceed with the proposed company's organization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incorporator filed with the commissioner the articles of incorporation of a proposed insurance company, together with all other required documentation. The incorporator paid the required fees for the cost of examination, investigation, and processing of the application by the commissioner. The attorney general refused to approve the incorporator's proposed articles of incorporation based upon an opinion he issued holding that the commissioner could refuse to accept the articles of incorporation of a proposed domestic insurance company where the purpose of incorporation was to avoid the premiums tax imposed upon foreign insurers. The incorporator filed his action, arguing that mandamus was the only remedy available. The court issued a writ of mandamus against the attorney general, but not against the commissioner. The court held that no writ could issue against the commissioner because the facts presented did not show any legal duty on her part at that point in time, however, the court held that the attorney general had improperly refused to certify the articles of incorporation because that determination was more properly within the province of the commissioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exchange for dismissal of other similar charges, defendant pled guilty to the charge of the delivery of cocaine. On appeal, he did not challenge the validity of his guilty plea, but asserted that the punishment scheme provided in the controlled substances act relating to cocaine violated his constitutional rights. The court found that, contrary to defendant's inference, the statute did not classify cocaine as a narcotic drug. The mere fact that similar penalties were imposed for crimes related to narcotic drugs did not lead to any rational conclusion that the Michigan Legislature operated under clearly erroneous factual assumptions in imposing the punishment scheme. No evidence justified defendant's assertion that to allow the identical maximum penalties for trafficking in cocaine as for trafficking in narcotic drugs was unconstitutionally arbitrary and unsupported by scientific fact. Defendant failed to argue in his brief the assertions that the punishment scheme imposed cruel and unusual punishment on him, or infringed his right to privacy, and the court did not consider either issue. The statute was not unconstitutional. Thus, the court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Employees of a clinic admitted the patient to the hospital. She was suffering from a complication of pregnancy known as preeclampsia.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent was killed in an automobile accident. The survivor of the decedent brought suit against the insurer for no-fault insurance benefits. The trial court held that Mich. Comp.

Laws &sect; 500.3109(1) was held to be constitutional, and the trial court was reversed and the case remanded. On remand, the issue was whether a $ 1,000 per 30-day limitation on the survivor's loss benefits limited the total combined benefits received from both the insurer and social security or whether it merely limited the benefits received from the insurer. After a judgment for the survivor, the insurer appealed. The court reversed and held that the statute allowed the insurer to offset the full amount of social security benefits paid to the survivor. Specifically, the court found that pursuant to Mich. Comp.

The lower court concluded that the plaintiffs' damages would likely have exceeded its jurisdictional limit of $ 10,000 and issued an order returning the case to the trial court. In doing so, the lower court relied on a recently enacted provision of the Revised Judicature Act (act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.641 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.641). The trial court then issued an order vacating the lower court's decision, and plaintiffs sought review.

The issue was whether the statute that exempted such homes from local ordinances was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foster care home applied to the department for a license to operate within the city. The city protested that the license would violate its zoning ordinance and brought an action against the department, the foster care home, and the residents, for injunctive relief to prevent issuance of the license. Two other cities joined as parties plaintiff. The trial court granted summary judgment against the cities for failure to state a cause of action, Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 117.2(1) (1963) and the cities sought review. The court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) Mich. Compiled Laws &sect; 125.583b (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2933(2)) exempted such homes from local zoning ordinances; (2) Mich. Const. art. 7, &sect; 22, provided for legislation to empower cities to adopt zoning ordinances but did not preclude the exemption, and a legitimate public interest, under Mich. Const. art. 8, &sect; 8 (1963), justified the exemption; (3) the statute did not violate Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 24 (1963), because it did not embrace more than one subject; and (4) the statute did not violate Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25 (1963), because the amendatory act did not alter the provisions of the amended act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent had executed a medical malpractice arbitration agreement after receiving treatment by the hospital. The decedent died in the hospital shortly thereafter. The arbitration agreement was never revoked. The trial court found that the estate was not bound by the decedent's agreement to arbitrate. The court found that a contract otherwise valid was binding upon a decedent's personal representative. The court determined that the medical malpractice arbitration act, Mich. Comp.

The court found that the legislature clearly showed an intent to limit legally enforceable interests of the abutting landowners in a zoning decision; therefore, the landowner's constitutional rights were not abridged. The court found that forbidding the department from issuing the specific licenses involved was not an appropriate remedy for alleged violation of Mich. Comp. Laws. &sect; 400.709(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16.610(59)(2)), but that summary judgment was inappropriate with regard to such alleged violations because the supporting documents were insufficient to decide the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed an order from a trial court (Michigan), which rendered unconstitutional a zoning ordinance that purportedly precluded the erection of additional movie theaters in the city. The city had to grant a waiver use, which would have allowed plaintiff land company, a motion picture exhibitor, to construct a new four-theater complex, with a seating capacity of over 1,800 people, on the southern parcel of property zoned C-2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that it could amend its zoning ordinance so as to classify theaters as a special or waiver use subject to review and compliance with specific standards with respect to location and structure when no attempt was made to restrict the content and type of film shown. The court found the city's argument consistent with Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.584a. It was clear that City of Livonia, Mich., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 11.03q precluded erection of any movie theaters in the C-2 district, and therefore restricted the expressive activities of the land company as well as any others who might have wished to build a movie theater. The court concluded that the city had adequately justified its limited restriction of expressive activities. The city had a compelling interest in adopting the ordinance in question. The city articulated a well-taken concern with the existing traffic and parking problems in the area. The court held that the provisions of the ordinance, which restricted the zones within which a theater could have been built, were narrowly drawn to serve a significant government interest and that the ordinance left open adequate alternative channels of communication.</SPAN></P>

After an administrative law examiner found that the physician had violated minimum standards of care in dispensing controlled substances, the Board adopted the examiner's findings and conclusions and ordered the physician to surrender his license. The trial court affirmed the order.

The physician also argued the Board's ex parte summary suspension of his license reversibly tainted its ultimate decision. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling for the Board.

After the mug shot was destroyed, the citizen initiated a count alleging a conspiracy to obstruct justice. The acting police chief brought a motion for a directed verdict. On review, the court noted that proof of a conspiracy was generally circumstantial in nature. Direct proof of agreement was not required, nor was it necessary that a formal agreement had to be proven. It was sufficient if the circumstances, acts, and conduct of the parties established an agreement in fact. Since conspiracy could be established by circumstantial evidence, and could be based on inference, the court found that the trial court had not erred in failing to grant a directed verdict to the acting police chief.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the legislature's classification of cocaine as a narcotic drug was not unconstitutional; (2) the penalty provision for a conviction under the controlled substances act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7101 et seq., did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment; (3) the trial court informed defendant of the maximum sentence that could be imposed as required by Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 785.7(1)(b) (1963); (4) consideration during sentencing of other criminal activities that defendant had been previously involved in that did not result in conviction was not improper as defendant did not complain that the information was inaccurate and he was given the opportunity to respond to the sentencing report; and (5) resentencing was required because the presentence report given to defendant and his attorney contained a different sentencing recommendation than did the report that was presented to the trial court.

The law was not unconstitutionally vague because standards used to determine relationship between risk of loss and age were well known and capable of calculation. Interpreting statute with deference to respondent and construing it liberally to favor the public, the court found respondent's interpretation of it was better than petitioner's, because the fact that group is particularly expensive to insure does not preclude fixing reasonable rate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In different trials, defendant was convicted of absconding on bond, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.199a (Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The libraries sought an order of superintending control over the judges.

The court noted that the Act specified that the arbitration panel was to be comprised of a lay person, a lawyer, and a health care provider. The court found that the composition of the panel made it highly probable that the panel would be biased against a claimant, and held that the failure to inform the patient of the panel's composition before the patient agreed to arbitrate was a denial of due process. The court concluded that, in light of the manner in which they were entered into, and the lack of information to patients, the arbitration agreements were unconscionable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in finding a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of defendant's Miranda rights. Defendant's argument that his confession should have been suppressed in that it was obtained as a result of an arrest made without probable cause was held to be without merit. An officer's question, &quot;What was like a bad dream?&quot; did not constitute &quot;interrogation&quot; under Miranda. Although defendant's incriminating statement was preceded by a question from a police officer, that question was asked in response to a volunteered statement by defendant and was not a question that the police officer should have known was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating statement. Defendant did not object to a possibly ambiguous and confusing preliminary instruction on insanity.

The trial court agreed with plaintiff automobile dealers that the definition did not establish reasonable and rational standards for a class of vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The automobile dealers contended that the entire statutory scheme adversely affected their business in that they were no longer able to rebuild motor vehicles that had been purchased from insurance companies or other sources and sell them for a sufficient profit because of the inclusion of the word &quot;rebuilt&quot; on the title. They also argued that the standards for issuance of a salvage certificate of title were not rational and constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The trial court agreed with the automobile dealers' arguments but the court rejected these arguments and reversed the trial court's decision. The court noted that when construing a statute, a court had to begin with the premise that the legislature did not intend to pass an unconstitutional enactment. It also had a duty to construe the statute to avoid constitutional difficulties and in a manner that comported with an ultimate finding of constitutionality. Applying these principles, the court concluded that the definition of a distressed vehicle was constitutional because it could the term uneconomical, as used in the statute referred only to monetary considerations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's car crashed into the owner's store and the owner filed an action against the driver. The driver filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that he was immune from property damage liability under the no-fault insurance laws. The owner filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the driver's insurer as a defendant. The trial court denied the motion to amend and granted summary judgment to the driver. On appeal, the court affirmed the summary judgment, reversed the denial of the motion to amend, and remanded. The court ruled that the driver was not liable for economic losses and that the action had to be filed against the insurer, not the driver. The court found that the statute barring any mention of an insurer in an injury action did not apply to actions for only economic losses. The court noted that the owner's motion to amend was denied because the one-year limitations period had expired. Because the insurer conducted the driver's defense and only filed the motion for summary judgment after the limitations period had expired, the court inferred that it acted with malice aforethought.

The probate court granted their request. The administrator filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied and he appealed. On appeal, the court reversed, ruling that Michigan and not Puerto Rican law controlled. The fact that the contested heirs were determined to be the illegitimate children of the deceased in a Puerto Rican court had no effect on the court's decision because Michigan law required proof of legitimacy in order to inherit from an estate and there was no evidence in the record to prove that the contested heirs were the deceased's legitimate children. The court concluded that the controlling law requiring proof of legitimacy of children seeking to inherit from their fathers was substantially related to important state interests, which the law was intended to promote and thus there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction had to be reversed because the legislature had never declared that possession of pentazocine was a crime. However, pursuant to a legislative grant of authority, the State Board of Pharmacy classified pentazocine as a Schedule 3 controlled substance in accordance with the procedure in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7215. The court held that the provisions of the controlled substances section of the Public Health Code permitting the State Board of Pharmacy to classify substances as &quot;controlled&quot; amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of the legislature's power to create criminal offenses. The creation of crimes was a peculiarly legislative prerogative. To declare what constituted a crime, and how it should be punished, was an exercise of the sovereign power of the State, and was inherent in the legislative department of the government. Further, the court agreed with defendant that he was denied due process under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV because he was not afforded fair notice of the conduct proscribed. In order of discover the criminal nature of pentazocine, one would have to wade through a morass of administrative regulations.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also found that the malpractice action was barred by an arbitration agreement executed by the patient's mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the patient's operation was negligently performed and resulted in permanent disfigurement, breathing problems, and emotional problems. On appeal, the patient argued that the R. Hood-McNeely-Geake Malpractice Arbitration Act of 1975 was unconstitutional because it required that one of the members of the arbitration panel be a physician. The court agreed and found that the requirement that a member of the tribunal be a physician created a constitutionally intolerable high probability of actual bias against the patient. The court held that because the statutory requirement that a member of the panel be a physician could not be reasonably separated from the remainder of the medical malpractice arbitration act, the entire act was declared unconstitutional. Therefore, the court reversed the order granting accelerated judgment to defendants. Furthermore, the court found that the action was not barred by the statute of limitations. It found that when the physician provided the patient with additional care by another physician, he continued to &quot;otherwise serve&quot; the patient and therefore the cause of action commenced within two years of the last treatment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's judgment of conviction, by holding that he was not unconstitutionally denied the effective assistance of counsel when the trial judge and the probation officer met because no information not contained in the presentence report was presented to the trial court at the meeting, nor did defendant suffer prejudice as a result of the meeting.</SPAN></P>

The revenue from this additional sales taxation was to be used exclusively to reimburse units of local government for revenues that were not collectible because of ad valorem property tax exemptions provided for in Proposal A. The taxpayers argued that 1981 Mich. Pub. Acts 6, &sect; 7a(2) was unconstitutional insofar as it required implementation and expenditure of public funds prior to approval of Proposal A. The court held that there was no provision in the Michigan Constitution that prohibited the expenditure of state funds for the collection of data for the &quot;homestead exemption affidavit&quot; defined in &sect; 7a(1)(a).

The court affirmed that denial on appeal. The court reasoned that the biological parent's right to privacy had to be considered, and that their agreement with the public health department stated that good cause was required for unsealing the adoption records, and that their right to privacy had to be considered. The court also determined that the public health department had an interest in maintaining an orderly and supervised adoption system. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that there was not good cause for opening the records, noting that the adoptee's &quot;deep seated psychological illness&quot; stemmed from her treatment in her adoptive home rather than not knowing her biological parent's identity. The court also concluded that the adoptee did not overcome Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 710.67 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3178(555.67)) and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 710.68 (Mich. Stat.

The court initially reversed. The attorney appealed and the Michigan Supreme Court found the statute to be constitutional but remanded the cause to the court with instructions that a limiting construction of the statute, consistent with First Amendment protections, be given. The court reviewed various United States Supreme Court cases related to legal advertising and concluded that the solicitation statute had to be construed so as to prohibit all in-person solicitation where an attorney sought to advance his own economic self-interest. Within the context of the statute, the court defined solicitation as a situation where the solicitor's position or relation to a prospective client was such that his request could have forced the recipient into acquiescing to the plea. Under this definition, the court concluded that mass-mailings were not prohibited but that telephone calls were.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected this argument and affirmed the reversal of the trial court's decision to grant defendant a jury trial as to his speeding citation. The court first noted that defendant's request for a jury trial was untimely and this untimeliness could have constituted a waiver of the right of jury trial, pursuant to Mich. Const. 1963, art. 1, &sect; 14. However, the court also noted that the trial judge had sole discretion to find defendant's compliance adequate and in these circumstances, the court concluded that defendant had standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute that ultimately denied him an opportunity for a trial by jury. The court reviewed the civil infraction act and noted that it was a new cause of action and there was no possibility of jail time. Therefore no penalty existed for which the right of a jury trial existed as it did for speeding infractions that occurred at the time of enactment of art. 1, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court considered defendant's claim that Mich. Comp.

Although defendant did not raise the issue at trial, the court considered it because manifest injustice would occur if defendant were convicted under an unconstitutional statute. The court concluded that defendant failed to show that the legislative classification of cocaine lacked a rational basis or was arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother commenced the paternity action over 10 years after the birth of her child. The father sought an accelerated judgment based upon the six-year limitation period contained within the paternity statute.&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.714(b) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.494(b)). The mother argued that the limitation period violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 (1963). The trial court ruled that the statute precluded the mother's paternity claim but allowed a declaratory judgment action on the child's behalf. On review, the court reversed and remanded for entry of accelerated judgment in favor of the father. The court held that, absent legislative action, a child could not maintain a paternity action separate from that allowed under the paternity statute and subject to the limitation period. The court held that the limitation period did not equal protection, because it was substantially related to permissible governmental interests of discouraging the litigation of stale or fraudulent paternity claims.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the statute clearly did not state that separate millage reduction fractions were calculated for each of the classes of property. Further, neither the language of the amendment nor its intent provided any indication that the classes of property whose assessments were separately equalized should have separate millage reduction fractions calculated. Additionally, there was no basis for finding the statute unconstitutional because it required data regarding both real and personal property to be used in calculating the millage reduction fraction when a uniform tax rate was to be applied to both.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that defendants were operating an adult theater without the required permit and that they were barred by prior adjudication in the federal court system from challenging the validity of ordinance. The theatre and owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that since the validity of the zoning ordinance was litigated extensively in the federal court system, the doctrine of res judicata barred the theatre and owners from maintaining the action. The theatre and owners argued that the doctrine was not applicable because the cause of action and the issues before the court differed from those litigated in the federal court action. The court determined that if the theatre and owners could have raised the exceptions taken to the ordinance in the state forum in the federal action, it had to find that res judicata barred the action. The court found that the identical parties were involved in this action, albeit they had switched the roles of plaintiff and defendant, and that the requirement that a subsequent suit be between the same parties before invoking the doctrine of res judicata was satisfied. The city established that it was bound by the federal court determination and a mutuality existed. Under the circumstances, the court held that the theatre and owners were subjecting the city to repeated litigation and that the doctrine of res judicata precluded the relitigation of the action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sufficiently balanced the probative value versus the prejudice of the evidence and found that evidence of the prior acts, an alleged robbery which included the theft of guns and ammunition, was proper to establish defendant's access to the murder weapon and was admissible to refute defendant's defense that he did not have motive to commit the crime of which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

The doctor had an agreement with the hospital to arbitrate all claims brought against the hospital or himself by reason of his medical care. After the patient's condition deteriorated, his parents filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice. Defendants sought dismissal of the case, contending that the execution of the arbitration agreement precluded filing suit in circuit court. The parents resisted the dismissal, arguing that the Medical Malpractice Arbitration Act (the Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5040 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5040 et seq., was constitutionally defective. The trial court granted defendants' motions for accelerated judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, both sides challenged decisions of the Ingham County Circuit Court (Michigan). Plaintiff prisoners sought review of the determination that the exclusion of &quot;drug traffickers&quot; from the community placement program was not arbitrary and capricious under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.265(a). Defendant Michigan Department of Corrections challenged the circuit court's decision against its blanket exclusion for drug traffickers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoners filed suit because the department refused to consider them for the community placement program. On appeal, the prisoners argued that the department exceeded its rule-making authority by precluding &quot;drug traffickers,&quot; as it defined the term, from consideration for eligibility in community placement programs. The court agreed, reversed the decision against the prisoners, and affirmed the decision against the department. The court held that the legislation authorizing community placement neither evinced an intent to exclude drug traffickers from consideration nor gave the department unfettered discretion to consider or fail to consider any class of offenders it deemed appropriate. The court held that the department could not have excluded an entire class of prisoners from consideration in light of the restrictions and exclusions explicitly adopted by the Michigan Legislature in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.265(a). The court stressed that its holding in no way suggested that participation in the community placement program by drug traffickers or anybody else was a matter of right. The department remained free to choose to exclude individual prisoners on a case-by-case basis.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the circuit court's order insofar as it held that a prisoner's classification as a &quot;drug trafficker&quot; automatically precluded his consideration for community placement. The action was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that the trial court's instruction to the jury on asportation was insufficient to convey the essential point that the asportation could not be merely incidental to the charged criminal sexual conduct. Defendant's right to a jury determination on all essential elements of the offense required that the trial court's instructions include all of the essential elements of the offense charged and not exclude from jury consideration material issues, defenses, or theories if there was evidence to support them. Failure to adequately instruct the jury on the essential element of asportation was reversible error. It was also reversible error to instruct the jury on the defense of consent to first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Defendant was charged with having committed first-degree criminal sexual conduct by sexual penetration under circumstances involving commission of a felony. The felony relied on was the charged kidnapping. Since there was no clear legislative intent to authorize multiple convictions for a single criminal act, defendant's conviction of both kidnapping and first-degree criminal sexual conduct violated the constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers' complaint was fatally flawed for failure to show their present or prospective damages and that the money could be used for general expenditures. They also failed to allege exposure to taxation because of the challenged expenditure of tax funds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle owner's insurer argued that the escape clause in its policy relieved it of liability. The driver's insurer argued that the escape clause contained in the vehicle owner's insurance policy could not be enforced because the escape clause was void as a matter of public policy as it violated the financial responsibility act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.520 (b) (2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2220(b)(2)). The driver's insurer also argued that its excess insurance clause that limited its liability where, as in this case, its insured was driving a non-owned automobile. The court agreed with the driver's insurer and reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the escape clause contained in the vehicle owner's policy was contrary to the financial responsibility act because it excluded a class of persons from insurance coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which convicted him based on his guilty plea of possession of 50 to 225 grams of a mixture containing cocaine, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7403(2)(a)(iii). Defendant was sentenced to lifetime probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised various constitutional challenges to the statutory provisions under which he was convicted and sentenced. Basically defendant was challenging the fact that a person convicted of possessing 51 grams of a mixture containing 15 percent cocaine was treated far more severely than a person convicted of possessing 49.9 grams of pure cocaine. He argued that the criminal classification scheme, which determined the severity of the crime solely by the weight of the mixture, which included the substance and not the substance's purity, offended constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the law. The court concluded that the classification did not deny equal protection of the law, although it believed that the legislature had adopted a bad policy. The court held that the policy was not irrational in part because an argument could be made that street pushers were at least as harmful as dealers were. Thus, the court concluded that the classification that effectively treated street dealers the same as real drug traffickers was rationally related to the purpose of eradicating illegal drug use in society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimant sought review of the decision of the court of claims (Michigan), which entered an order limiting the claimant's recovery against defendant highway department to the degree of negligence attributable to the department, in the claimant's negligence action alleging that the department had failed to maintain a roadway in a condition reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's vehicle collided with a truck driver's vehicle on a newly opened highway lane. The claimant filed suit against the driver and the driver's employer. Prior to trial, the claims were settled. The claimant then filed the instant action against the department, alleging that the department failed to maintain the roads in a reasonably safe condition. After a bench trial, the court of claims determined that the claimant was 60 percent negligent, that the driver was 30 percent negligent, and that the department was 10 percent negligent. The court of claims, applying the principles of comparative negligence, limited the claimant's damages against the department to 10 percent of the damages determined by the court of claims. The court noted that the contribution statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.2925d, permitted a nonsettling joint tortfeasor to subtract the amount of a settlement from a judgment, but did not permit contribution from the settling joint tortfeasor. The court concluded that the statutory settlement provision applicable to joint tort liability survived the adoption of comparative negligence and the court of claims improperly limited the claimant's recovery.</SPAN></P>
