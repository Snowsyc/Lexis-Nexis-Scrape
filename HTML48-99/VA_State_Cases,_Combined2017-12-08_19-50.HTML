</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Portsmouth (Virginia), which entered convictions against defendant for several crimes involving abduction, murder, and carjacking, and sentenced defendant to the death penalty pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.4, and to life for each of defendant's noncapital convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of the abduction, carjacking, and murder of his former live-in girlfriend. Based upon the testimony of several witnesses, a jury found defendant guilty of violating Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-31(1), 18.2-67.2(A), 18.2-48, and 18.2-58.1. Subsequently, the jury fixed defendant's punishment at death for the capital offense, and at life imprisonment for each noncapital conviction, and the trial court sentenced defendant accordingly. The death sentence came before the appellate court under automatic review, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17.1-313(A), and the court accepted review of defendant's other appeals. The court affirmed the appropriateness of defendant's death sentence based upon the vileness of the crime, and based upon the sufficiency of the testimony concerning his future dangerousness. The court reasoned that the trial court did not err in excluding certain potential jurors because of their opposition to considering the death penalty, if required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of trial court affirmed, because the trial court committed no error, and an independent analysis based on a review of the entire record revealed that the sentence of death was properly assessed, as were the sentences for defendant's noncapital convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed an order of the Court of Appeals of Virginia affirming the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss his reindictment for the same offenses after the granting State's motion for nolle prosequi on the original indictment based on alleged violations of U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was indicted for obtaining and attempting to obtain money by false pretenses. The prosecution later filed a continuance motion, which was denied, so the prosecution moved to nolle prosequi indictment. The trial court granted the motion. Later, criminal defendant was indicted again on the same charges. Criminal defendant's motion to dismiss indictment was denied and the lower court affirmed the denial. This appeal followed. The court noted that the granting of a motion for nolle prosequi would only be overturned if there was clear evidence that the decision to grant the motion was not judicially sound. The record supported the trial court's action in granting the nolle prosequi. The court evaluated four factors to determine whether criminal defendant had been deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court concluded that the period between criminal defendant's appearance to accept service of the second indictment and his subsequent conviction did not constitute a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of the reindictment because defendant's speedy trial right was not violated where the court considered the period between appearance to accept service of his reindictment and the subsequent conviction rather than the period from first indictment to the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision finding the Commission was not erecting barriers against interstate commerce since appellant was a public service corporation in intrastate trade as a public utility and was seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity to pursue such activity. However, the court found that before receiving such certificate appellant was acquiring interest in land and participating in construction of facilities and, therefore, the Commission did not abuse its authority in issuing its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder under Va.

Sentences imposed by the jury included a sentence of death for the capital murder. Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences. He challenged the death penalty on constitutional grounds and asserted that the trial court erred in 1) not providing a requested bill of particulars, 2) denying his discovery requests, 3) denying him additional peremptory challenges, 4) admitting evidence of unadjudicated criminal conduct at the sentencing phase, 5) admitting evidence found months after the crime, 6) denying testimony on the conditions of prison life, and 7) allowing the testimony of minors against him. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court concluded that there was no merit in any of the claimed errors and that the death penalty was justified because plaintiff had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant would be a continuing serious threat to society and that his conduct in committing the murders was vile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Madison County (Virginia), which affirmed the denial of plaintiff's application to approve his 191-acre subdivision plat that included a nine acre closed landfill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff asserted trial court error in withholding approval of his 191-acre subdivision plat that included a closed landfill, because a &quot;substantial surface drainage course&quot; was located on the landfill area. The court disagreed, noting first that plaintiff was planning to build a road over the landfill but that he was unwilling to accept a drainage easement prohibiting any land disturbing activity in the landfill area that would affect the existing drainage course. Explaining, the court rejected plaintiff's assertion that the &quot;course&quot; -- as used in the applicable county ordinance barring land disturbing activity -- meant a creek bed or gully, ruling that the ordinance's use of &quot;stream or drainage course&quot; encompassed differing topographical land features. Moreover, the trial court did not err in finding a substantial drainage course on plaintiff's landfill, on the basis of testimony by a professional engineer. Finally, the court rejected the contention that rejection of plaintiff's application was justified only if the &quot;course&quot; was located in the area being subdivided, rather than the landfill, as the parcels encompassed by the subdivision application included the landfill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed denying plaintiff's application to approve his subdivision plat that included a closed landfill, because denial was properly based on existence of &quot;substantial surface drainage course&quot; on the landfill, as &quot;course&quot; -- used in ordinance barring land disturbing activity -- not limited to creek bed, but included other land features, as substantial nature of drainage confirmed by engineer, and as application included landfill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Accomack County (Virginia), convicting him of capital murder, forcible sodomy, using a firearm in the commission of a felony, and possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony, and sentencing defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder, forcible sodomy, using a firearm in the commission of those offenses, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant made several arguments on appeal, including that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence statements he made to police, that the trial court erred in refusing defendant's proffered jury instruction regarding the voluntariness of his statements to police, and that the death penalty was improper. The court ruled that the admissibility of defendant's statements was an issue to be decided by the trial court and that the trial court's determination was the resolution of a question of fact based on the totality of the circumstances. Further, the court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction unless it was supported by more than a scintilla of evidence and that the trial court properly refused defendant's proffered instruction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, concluding that the record supported the jury's determination that defendant constituted a continuing serious danger to society.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting defendant and sentencing him to death was affirmed where defendant's statement to police was properly admitted into evidence by the trial court, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to set aside the verdict, and the evidence supported the jury's determination that defendant's conduct in committing sodomy and murder constituted torture of his victim or reflected depravity of mind.</SPAN></P>

Respondent informed petitioner that he would not make the payments until the beginning of the next legislative term if the legislation were enacted . Petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent not to make such payments and filed a motion to add certain parties. Respondent objected arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's petition. The court ruled that Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with killing an adult and two children with a shotgun and then setting their house on fire in an attempt to conceal the murders. A jury convicted defendant on all counts, and in the sentencing phase of the trial, recommended the death penalty pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.4. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion for change of venue, that the evidence against him was insufficient to support a conviction, and that he was not competent to stand trial. The death sentence was automatically appealed pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17-110.1(A), and the court consolidated the two appeals. The court affirmed the convictions and sentence because defendant failed to show that he did not receive a fair trial in the jurisdiction where the crimes occurred, because the witness and forensic testimony was more than credible and was not unduly prejudicial to defendant, and because the evidence was overwhelming. Finally, the court ruled that although defendant was a paranoid delusional, he was not incompetent or unable to cooperate with his attorneys.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court failed to grant him additional peremptory strikes during jury selection, that the trial court failed to set aside his conviction for capital murder, and that the jury was not properly instructed during the penalty phase. The court ruled that there was no right to additional peremptory challenges in a capital murder trial. Further, the court held that the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded testimony were questions for the fact finder and that the trial court did not err in refusing to set aside the capital murder conviction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but vacated the death sentence, concluding that it was materially vital to defendant that the jury have a proper verdict form and that when a principle of law was materially vital to a defendant in a criminal case, it was reversible error for the trial court to refuse a defective instruction instead of correcting it and giving it in the proper form.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, plaintiff argued that the medical malpractice cap was unconstitutional on seven independent grounds: right to trial by jury, special legislation, taking of property, due process, equal protection, separation of powers, and province of the judiciary. The court rejected each of plaintiff's arguments, and noted that the case which plaintiff requested be overturned had been cited in 16 subsequent opinions by the court without any indication that error existed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city enacted Richmond, Va., Code &sect; 27-152.1, a city ordinance imposing utility taxes on telephone, electric, and gas service. The ordinance established different tax rates for purchasers of commercial and residential service. When defendant imposed its commercial tax rate on plaintiff condominium association, plaintiff moved to correct the allegedly erroneous assessment. Defendant appealed a trial court judgment, which held that the ordinance was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant. The court held that the ordinance was valid because its classifications rested on real differences between utility purchasers and were applied in the same manner to other condominium associations. The court noted that the classifications imposed a greater tax rate on commercial volume purchasers who received the benefit of a lower purchase price from utility providers. The court ruled the fact that the individual owners' assessments were the source of funds for payment of plaintiff's obligations did not alter the fact that the association contracted and paid for the utility services.</SPAN></P>

In a separate trial involving another victim, defendant pled guilty to capital murder in the commission of object sexual penetration and capital murder in the commission of attempted rape, in violation of Va.

The sentences were not arbitrary, excessive, disproportionate, or the product of passion or prejudice.

Striking a juror because she had not even read or heard anything about a well-publicized case clearly was a race-neutral reason. Further, the court stated that the evidence was undisputed that appellant deliberately shot the victim twice in the chest at extremely close range with a high-powered assault rifle. Appellant stated not only that he planned and carried out the attack with premeditation and without any provocation, but also that he deliberately aimed his weapon at the victims' chests. This established as a matter of law that the victim's murder was intentional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death. Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant's assertions that the Virginia capital murder and death penalty statutes were unconstitutional were insufficient and constituted a procedural default. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a bill of particulars. The court determined that defendant's Miranda rights had not been violated and therefore the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress his confession. The confession was made knowingly and voluntarily and was the product of defendant's free choice. The court further held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The evidence was obtained through the valid consent of both defendant and defendant's uncle. Defendant also did not overcome the presumption that he could have received a fair trial and the denial of his motion to change venue was correct. Finally, the court held that the indictment adequately informed defendant, the scientific evidence was admissible, jury instructions were proper, and the sentence was not incorrect.</SPAN></P>

The state court ruled that the phrase &quot;for the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election,&quot; in CFDA's reporting, disclosure, and identification requirements, applied only to those persons and groups advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On August 30, 1995, defendant was charged with driving after having been declared an habitual offender. He was convicted of that offense of March 19, 1996. Defendant was apprehended following his operation of a motor vehicle on February 11, 1996. Defendant was found guilty of the felony of driving after having been adjudicated an habitual offender, second offense. The appellate court sustained defendant's conviction for that offense. Defendant sought review of the appellate court's judgment, which was affirmed. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-351 defined an habitual offender as a person who had accumulated the required number of multiple convictions for separate offenses that related to operation of motor vehicles. Moreover, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-357(B)(3) established that a second violation of the offense of driving while a determination as an habitual offender was in effect was punishable as a felony. The court concluded that a conviction for the first offense was not a prerequisite for a defendant to be charged with a second offense of driving in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-357. The court also found that the amendment of the indictment comported with Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-231.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals of Virginia reversed an order of visitation by appellant grandparents of their granddaughter, the daughter of appellee parents. The appellate court remanded the case for reconsideration in accord with its decision. The grandparents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents in an intact family had a child. The grandparents sought visitation with the child. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-124.2(b), as it pertained to nonparent visitation, permitted grandparents, and others, to seek visitation. The parents contended that the statute interfered with their right to autonomy in child rearing. The court found that, although the statute was constitutional, the grandparents were not entitled to visitation. In order to require visitation, the court would have had to have found actual harm to the child's health or welfare without such visitation. Finding none, visitation was not required. The court found that it could not even consider the &quot;best interests&quot; of the child to determine visitation because it did not first find harm when visitation was not ordered. The child's family was intact. There was no evidence of parental abuse or neglect. The parents were mentally, physically, and morally fit, and were capable of meeting their child's financial, educational, moral, and social needs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court found that there was no allegation or proof that denial of grandparent visitation would be detrimental to the child's welfare. Consequently, the court modified the appellate court's judgment to eliminate the requirement of a remand. The court affirmed the judgment as modified. In so doing, the court denied the grandparents' petition for visitation and dismissed the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in the trial court's refusal to allow defendant, during voir dire, to &quot;educate&quot; jurors on the issue of parole ineligibility of defendants upon whom life sentences are imposed in capital murder cases. The court held that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to excuse a juror, who was investigating officer's second cousin, for cause. The court found that the trial court acted well within its discretion in denying defendant's motion for change of venue. The court held that it was within the trial court's discretion to admit an in-life photograph of the victim. The court held that defendant's statement to police officer was admissible; clearly, the statement was not the result of custodial interrogation, because defendant initiated the conversation and the statement was voluntary.

Appellant sought review of his conviction. The court affirmed. The court held that appellant's confession was voluntary, that he was not entitled to a change of venue, that the trial court properly refused to strike the entire venire, that the prosecutor's peremptory challenges were not race based, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting a cousin of the prosecutor's spouse and an illiterate person to be seated as jurors. The court also held that because the motions for continuances were jointly made, appellant's trial was speedy and the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient and not prejudicial. The court also held that because it was appropriate under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-291.1 and Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the execution of a search warrant, the police found a marijuana plant growing near the entrance to defendant's house. The plant was in a flowerbed that defendant had planted, and it was the only plant in the flowerbed that had been watered recently. In defendant's home, the police found a large metal tray containing hemostats, rolling paper, and enough marijuana to roll a cigarette. Defendant admitted to the police that he sometimes used the metal tray when he rolled marijuana cigarettes, and that he had smoked a &quot;joint&quot; just before the police arrived at his home. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, affirming defendant's conviction and sentence. The court concluded that the evidence fully supported the trial court's finding that defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed marijuana. Although Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-259.1 mandated suspension of a driver's license for a drug offense that did not involve the operation of a motor vehicle, it was reasonable to conclude that a purpose of the statute was to protect persons using the commonwealth's highways.

Plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court denied a new trial and concluded that additur would be adequate. The trial court determined that $ 5,000 was adequate. The trial court then gave defendant alleged tortfeasor the option of either paying the damages or submitting to a new trial. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion to reconsider and upheld the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-383.1(B) in cases where the damages were unliquidated. The section allowed a trial court to use additur when it determined that the damages awarded by a jury were inadequate. The court held that &sect; 8.01-383.1(B), as written and as applied in the instant action, violated an individual's right to a jury trial as guaranteed in Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Plaintiff did not have the opportunity to consent to the use of additur and was required to forego her right to have a new jury assess her damages. Thus, the trial court, in its application of &sect; 8.01-383.1(B) denied plaintiff her right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The media organizations were investigating the efficiency of the county's 911 system. Pursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, the media organizations requested from the sheriff audio tape recordings concerning a specific 911 call. The sheriff denied the request contending that the tape was an official record and exempt under &sect; 15.1-135.1(B)(5). The media organizations filed an action for injunctive relief that sought to compel the disclosure of the tape. The trial court denied the media organizations' petition finding that the tape was exempt. On appeal, the court agreed that the tape was exempt from the Act under &sect; 15.1-135.1(B)(5) as noncriminal incident records. The tape qualified as a compilation under the section because it was a grouping of electronically gathered information. The tape contained a recording of multiple channels of radio traffic handled by the dispatch office. The tape was a law enforcement record because the sheriff operated the 911 system during the performance of his traditional law enforcement duties.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff landowners filed an amended bill of complaint asserting that the town's refusal to vacate the subdivision plat was unreasonable, unwarranted, discriminatory, arbitrary, and capricious and constituted both a permanent and temporary taking of their land without just compensation. The Circuit Court of Fauquier County (Virginia) sustained the town's demurrer. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the town's action in refusing to vacate the subdivision plat was a legislative act left to its discretion, that the amended bill of complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to overcome the presumption of reasonableness attaching to a legislative act, and that the landowners failed to allege that they had been denied all economic use of their property. The court affirmed. The town's action was authorized by the Virginia Land Subdivision Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 15.1-465-485, which addressed the approval, rejection, and vacation of subdivision plats and delegated that portion of the state's police power to regulate the use of land to local governing bodies. The pleadings did not allege that either adjacent property was subject to an approved subdivision plat which had to be vacated before the respective apartment complexes could be constructed or that the action was arbitrary, capricious, unwarranted, or discriminatory. Because development of the property with townhouses was an economically viable use of the property, and the pleadings did not assert that the town had precluded such development, there was no unconstitutional taking of property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of Arlington County (Virginia), which convicted him of murder and imposed the death sentence. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in receiving &quot;victim impact evidence&quot; from persons other than family members of the victims, and in receiving recommendations concerning the imposition of the death penalty from the victims' friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to capital murder of his cousin and another individual. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court held that defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the Virginia death penalty statute was waived by his guilty plea and was not cognizable on appeal. Victim impact statements were not constitutionally limited to that received from the victim's family members, and victim impact evidence during the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial was limited only by the relevance of such evidence to show the impact of defendant's actions. So long as its prejudicial effect did not outweigh its probative value, such evidence was beneficial to the determination of an individualized sentence as was required by the Eighth Amendment. Further, there were no prohibitions under the Crime Victim and Witness Rights Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 19.2-11.01 to -11.4, that limited the nature of victim impact evidence to statements from only the victim's family members. As in any other criminal proceeding, the determination of the admissibility of relevant evidence was within the sound discretion of the trial court subject to the test of abuse of that discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.

The court gave deference to the trial court's decision, and determined that it was clear from the prospective juror's answers that his brother's murder would not have prevented him from judging defendant impartially. The court noted that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a bill of particulars because the record showed that defendant had full knowledge of all evidence to be used against him.

The governor concluded that the bill was not properly enrolled under Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12; art. V, &sect; 6. The governor claimed that he was unable to exercise item veto over the bill and stated that the bill was a legal nullity because it was not properly enrolled and presented. Pursuant to Va.

The attorney general then filed an action seeking a writ of mandamus and sought a declaration that H.R. 29 was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an indigent, challenged his capital murder conviction for the brutal rape and murder of his girlfriend and his conviction for rape.

Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in removing prospective jurors for cause. The appellate court consolidated the automatic review of defendant's death sentence with the appeal of right of his capital murder conviction. The appellate court determined that defendant waived consideration of all but 14 of the errors cited because he failed to discuss the assignments of error in his brief. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and the death sentence because defendant failed to make the particularized showing that would have entitled him to the appointment of an expert forensic pathologist.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that the city's assessments of BPOL taxes were not fairly apportioned, as they did not comply with the requirements of external consistency, and, thus, constituted an improper local restraint on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. The court agreed with the trial court's judgment that the assessment was unconstitutional. The court concluded that the taxpayer met its burden of proof by presenting clear and cogent evidence that the income which the city through its assessments attributed to operations conducted in the city was out of all appropriate proportions to and had no rational relationship to the business transacted in the city. The assessments were based on 100 percent of the taxpayer's revenues including revenues realized from value produced in locations other than in the taxing jurisdiction. Given the number of facilities and operations outside the city, it was clear that the value added to the product by the taxpayer's city operations could not possibly produce 100 percent of the revenues.</SPAN></P>

At the penalty phase of the trial, the trial court struck the evidence as to the &quot;vileness&quot; predicate of a capital sentence, but submitted the case to the jury upon the &quot;future dangerousness&quot; predicate. The jury found that the &quot;future dangerousness&quot; predicate was satisfied and unanimously fixed defendant's punishment at death. The trial court sentenced defendant in accordance with the jury verdict. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress his confession as being involuntary. The court held that the statements were voluntary, without threats, promises, or coercion. The court also found that defendant did not overcome the presumption that he could receive a fair trial. A change of venue was not therefore mandated. The court found that his confession corroborated the corpus delicti of capital murder.

The jury sentenced him to death for the murders, fixed his punishment at 20 years' imprisonment on each of the robbery convictions and assessed a total of 18 years' imprisonment for the four firearm convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant contested the sufficiency of evidence proving that he was a triggerman in the murder of the victims and that their murders were committed in the course of a robbery. The court found however that facts established the logical and legitimate inference that defendant used his revolver to shoot both victims. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to present during sentencing evidence of the fact of the life sentence imposed on his accomplice. The court disagreed holding that the evidence was irrelevant as to the jury's determination of appropriate punishment and did not bear on the issue of mitigation. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury's finding of vileness because the record was silent as to the existence of torture. The court maintained that the execution of two persons in their home and stealing their personal property manifestly demonstrated a depravity of mind. The court also maintained that the killing inflicted by multiple gunshot wounds could constitute an aggravated battery. Therefore the court found that the death penalty was not excessive or disproportionate punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought proceedings in several courts seeking refunds of taxes paid on income from civil service annuities or pensions for federal employment or military duty. The trial court denied appellants' requests for refunds and ruled that Virginia provided a taxpayer a meaningful pre-deprivation opportunity to challenge a tax, sufficient to satisfy due process, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-184. The trial court ruled further that, assuming there had been no due process violation, Virginia's refund statute,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-1826, did not mandate refunds to the taxpayers in the present case because the statute vested the court with discretion in determining whether refunds should be ordered. On appeal, the court reversed and held that, given the clear applicability of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-1826, no reasonable taxpayer would have thought that a declaratory judgment proceeding, even assuming its constitutional adequacy, represented the exclusive remedy for relief from unlawful taxes in Virginia and that the use of the word &quot;may&quot; in the tax refund statute could not be construed to indicate that the refund of illegal collected taxes was discretionary.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the plain meaning of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-35.1 and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.15, read together, required the reduction of the verdict.

The realtors sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realtors argued that the brochure was protected commercial speech. The court found that a name was used for advertising purposes when it appeared in a publication distributed as an advertisement. The court held that the realtors' flyer clearly was advertising material and that the injured party's name was used for advertising purposes in a manner forbidden by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-40(A). The court also held that the brochure was not the type of commercial speech accorded constitutional protection and that &sect; 8.01-40(A) was not constitutionally invalid. The court rejected the realtors' claim of error regarding its liability for trover and common-law conversion because Virginia recognized a property interest in one's name and likeness and the realtors used the injured party's name as their own, without his consent. The court held that the injured party's expert witness was qualified and that the compensatory damage award was supported by evidence. The court also held that the jury was properly instructed regarding punitive damages, although the award should have been limited to the amount sought in the complaint, and that a nominal damage instruction was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment by reducing the amount of the punitive damage award and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed an application for review and correction of tax assessments for the value of certain public service company real property. The county's position was that the local assessment ratio, as determined by the Virginia Department of Taxation under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-2604(A), was incorrect. Thus, the county asked that the Commission order the publication of a new local assessment ratio. In the alternative, the county argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-2604 was unconstitutional on the ground that it allowed assessment of real property at a rate less than fair market value. The Commission entered an order dismissing the application. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-2604(A) empowered the Department of Taxation, and not the Commission, to determine and publish the ratio. Further, the Commission had to apply that ratio, and the statute did not contravene the constitutional requirements of uniformity and fair market value as set forth under Va.

Defendant was sentenced based on the future dangerousness predicate. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed a convenience store. On his way there, he checked the gun and saw that it was loaded. Defendant knew the clerk at the store, and had told the accomplices that the clerk was &quot;a little slow&quot; and would not give them any trouble. Nonetheless, when the clerk did not react to demands for the money, defendant pointed the gun at the clerk, said &quot;boom, boom,&quot; and pulled the trigger. The clerk died. The court found no reversible error among the issues presented by defendant's appeals and, having conducted the review mandated by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17-110.1, the court declined to commute the sentence of death and affirmed the sentence. The record did not demonstrate that the pre-trial publicity had prejudiced defendant or denied him a fair trial. The death penalty was not unconstitutional in Virginia. The justifications for the commonwealth's three peremptory strikes were not racially motivated. An accomplice's statement was admissible hearsay as a declaration against penal interest. Premeditation did not need to exist for any certain length of time. Last, the trial court did not err in concluding that there was insufficient good cause shown to set aside the jury verdict.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A videotape of the robbery showed that defendant ordered a store clerk to hand him money and to get down on the floor behind the counter. After the clerk gave defendant the money and disappeared behind the counter, defendant reached over the counter and shot the clerk in the back. The court affirmed his conviction. The court held that the sentencing jury was not required to be informed that if defendant were sentenced to life he would not be eligible for parole for at least 25 years. Such information was required only when the defendant would not be parole eligible at all. It was not error to have the videotape played twice for the jury because a witness' concurrent explanation of the videotape as it was being played the second time could have aided the jury in understanding the events as they happened. Defendant's decision to shoot the clerk, purportedly because he laughed at him, coupled with his effort to lean over the counter to shoot the clerk, provided ample evidence of premeditation. Finally, evidence of subsequent crimes committed by defendant was admissible as part of his prior history under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.4(C).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to strike the commonwealth's evidence relating to the charge of capital murder committed during the course of an abduction for pecuniary benefit, the abduction charge itself, and the related firearm charge. The court held that transporting the victim from the robbery scene was a detention separate and apart from, and not merely incidental to, the robbery and was greater than the restraint intrinsic in a robbery. The evidence clearly supported a finding that the abduction was committed to protect the fruits of the robbery and to escape an arrest. Therefore, the evidence supported the charge of abduction with the intent to extort a pecuniary benefit. Consequently, the trial court did not err in refusing to strike the commonwealth's evidence. Defendant claimed that the instruction granted by the trial court did not make clear to the jury that it was free to fix punishment at life imprisonment even if it found either or both aggravating factors. The court held that death penalty was not mandatory even if both aggravating factors were proven by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged 47 errors, the majority of which were neither properly briefed nor argued and were therefore summarily dismissed. Other miscellaneous issues dealing with evidence, jury instructions, and inquiries by the jury during its deliberations were denied due to lack of merit. The court did address two issues; the permitting of a police officer to testify that a third party had stated to another investigator defendant &quot;did, in fact, shoot the trooper.&quot; The court denied defendant's argument that this statement was hearsay, because it was not offered to prove that defendant shot the trooper, but to explain why the police officer decided to arrest defendant. The other issue involved the proportionality of the penalty to the crime. The court, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-110.1(C)(2) and 17-110.1(E), examined similar death penalty cases that it had decided, and conclude the penalty was proportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowner sought to purchase realty from appellant putative owner. After the landowner determined that the putative owner did not have legal title, he sought its sale under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 41.1-16. Appellants public interest group, which had optioned to buy the land, the commonwealth, and the county were joined in the action. The Circuit Court of Rockbridge County (Virginia) ordered the property sold and several parties sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court permitted an appeal by intervenors who claimed that they were improperly denied notice of the initial action. The court held that the only substantive issue it could address on the appeal was whether the land was waste and unappropriated within the meaning of &sect; 41.1-16. The court found that all lands that had never been patented were considered waste and unappropriated and that such lands were susceptible to location and sale under &sect; 41.1-16. The court rejected the intervenors' claim that the property was appropriated due to the public's use of the land, the putative owner's claim of possessory rights, and a quitclaim deed to the property obtained by the public interest group. The court held that the evidence was clear that the property was never titled by grant or patent from the commonwealth and that the putative owner had no title and thus had nothing to convey to the public interest group. The court also held that the mere fact of public use and a claim of possessory rights did not provide anyone with a valid claim of ownership. Thus, the court upheld the lower court and concluded that the land was waste and unappropriated land within the meaning of &sect; 41.1-16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court and remanded the cause for such further proceedings as were necessary to accomplish the sale of the property.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 19.2-264.5 provided the trial court with a clear and meaningful review of a death sentence and that the trial court had concluded that there was no &quot;good cause&quot; to set it aside. The court found no abuse of discretion in the admission of photographs of the murder scenes because the trial court had reviewed all the photographs before their admission and the photographs adequately portrayed the manner in which defendant committed the offense. The court rejected defendant's claim that it improperly instructed the jury that it was limited to the sentencing choices they had been given.

Defendant had challenged various aspects of the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court did not find any reversible errors, and affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence. The court rejected defendant's contentions that the imposition of the death penalty violated the state constitution, and the aggravating factors set forth in Va.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence the photographs of the victim's body, and the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of attempted forcible rape and capital murder. Finally, the court did not find anything in the record that the jury had imposed the death sentence under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate brought an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging that prison officials misapplied Virginia's parole eligibility statute,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 53.1-151. Although convicted on more than one occasion, the inmate only received an active prison sentence on his most recent conviction. The prison officials maintained that because the inmate was convicted of three separate felonies of armed robbery, he was not eligible for parole. The federal court presented certified questions to the state court as to whether a Virginia inmate had to be convicted of a felony and committed to a Virginia correctional facility on three occasions before being rendered ineligible for parole. The court determined that the statute in effect on the date of the offenses for which the inmate was convicted mandated that when, as here, a person was convicted of three separate felony offenses of murder, rape, or armed robbery, which were not part of a common act, transaction, or scheme, the felon was ineligible for parole. The court held that &sect; 53.1-151(B1) did not require three separate commitments to a correctional facility for armed robbery before the convict could be classified as ineligible for parole.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the city, and the corporation sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. A rational basis existed for the tax because the cable corporation and the satellite vendors utilized different transmission methods to supply their programs, and the differences justified the tax distinction. The cable corporation's franchise enabled it to use facilities along the city's streets in its transmission system. Thus, the cable corporation could furnish television service without the necessity of the additional equipment the satellite viewers had to obtain. In the court's opinion, the differences in the methods regarding service to satellite and cable users provided a rational basis for the distinction between the taxation of the cable corporation's billings to its subscribers, and the nontaxation of the satellite vendors' billings to their subscribers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder in commission with a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. The Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia) entered a jury verdict of conviction, and sentenced defendant to death. Pursuant to Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was not erroneous to deny defendant's motion for discovery of accomplices' polygraph tests. While the State had a duty to provide impeachment material to have been used against the State's witnesses, under the Fourteenth Amendment, defendant's pure speculation that the tests contained exculpatory evidence did not create a duty of disclosure. Also, defendant failed to show materiality in a constitutional sense by failing to describe events that the accomplices' might have testified to that were relevant to guilt or punishment. No error had been committed by limiting defendant's cross-examination of the accomplices to exclude their prior unconvicted criminal conduct, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-269, because admission of unadjudicated crimes would have confused the jury and directed its attention to collateral matters. Finally, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17-110.1(C), the court reviewed defendant's death sentence in relation to other similar offenses where death had been imposed and found based upon defendant's life-long violent criminal history, the penalty was not excessive, disproportionate, nor imposed by the jury under the influence of passion or prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed based upon its conclusion that there was no basis in the record to commute the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county and related members, sought review from the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia), which reduced appellee purchaser's personal property tax, as assessed by the county, to reflect the fair market value of the personal property. The county asserted that its depreciation schedule was uniform and reasonably expected to determine the actual fair market value of the purchaser's computer equipment under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3503.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser bought computer systems from the seller, and the next year the seller enhanced the computer systems that made the purchaser's systems obsolete and substantially reduced the fair market value of the computers. The county assessed tangible business personal property taxes against the computers, and the purchaser argued that the assessment was erroneous because it did not reflect the fair market value of the computers. The purchaser filed a petition for relief, and the lower court held that the purchaser had met its burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness of the assessments and that the property was assessed at more than its fair market value. The county appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that, under Va. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, the burden of taxation was to be distributed evenly and equitably. The court ruled that the computers were assessed at greater than fair market value and the disparity between the fair market value and the assessed value constituted a manifest error. The court held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-3503 did not provide the exclusive method of reducing an assessment of personal property to reflect a lower market value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's reduction of the county's personal property tax assessment on the purchaser's computer system.</SPAN></P>

The county board of supervisors enacted legislation granting the SUP. The landowners did not request that the trial court declare condition a condition of the SUP unconstitutional. Rather, it sought a declaratory judgment that the board's interpretation of the condition was unconstitutional, as well as an injunction prohibiting the board from enforcing its decision. The board's decision did not address the validity or constitutionality of any part of the SUP. The trial court erroneously ruled on an issue that was not pleaded specifically in the request for declaratory judgment. The certiorari process did not authorize the trial court to rule on the validity or constitutionality of legislation underlying the board's decision. The only issue properly before the trial court was whether the board's decision was plainly wrong or applied erroneous principles of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor won a contract to renovate the county courthouse. The county suspended the work for various plan design defects. The contractor alleged that the county knew of the defects before it bid the contract, and induced him to submit a price based on defective specifications. He filed a claim for additional costs and damages, which was denied through an administrative process that culminated in a hearing before the designee of the director of public works, who also denied the claim. The contractor argued that he was denied the right to have his claim heard by a disinterested hearing officer. The court agreed, holding that under the Virginia Public Procurement Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-35 through 11-80, the contractor was entitled to a hearing before a disinterested officer, and the designee of the county official was not such an officer. The court rejected the argument that the contract substituted a dispute resolution procedure that did not require a hearing before a disinterested officer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, among defendant's 44 assignments of error, he raised a number of issues that, in previous decisions, had been resolved adversely to his contentions. Of the remaining issues, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his discovery motion, in denying his motion to suppress incriminating statements he made to police officers after he was arrested, and in denying his motion to exclude video cameras. Further, defendant alleged that the trial court erred in the jury selection process, erred in evidentiary rulings, and committed errors during the penalty phase. This court reviewed the imposition of defendant's death sentence to determine whether the sentence: (1) was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; or (2) was excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and defendant. After consideration of the several assignments of error, this court held that the trial court ruled correctly upon each of the objections defendant raised in this appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state officials adjusted the electoral districts to reflect changes in population shifts to conform to the constitutional requirements of equal representation.

The court disagreed and found that the language of art. II, &sect; 6 clearly limited compactness to spatial restrictions in the composition of electoral districts. The court affirmed the judgment because there was evidence from which the circuit court could have concluded that the legislature had considered compactness in reconciling the multiple concerns of apportionment. The court also gave deference to the parts of the circuit court's decision that were based on conflicting evidence because that court was in the position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.</SPAN></P>

The court found that 1) defendant did not make an unambiguous request for counsel during the confession and further that defendant had prior experience with police interrogation procedures and knew how to ask for legal counsel, was 42 years old at the time he made this confession, had a high school equivalency diploma, and was properly advised of his Miranda rights and understood them; 2) statements regarding going to jail were simply impatient gestures and did not constitute an invocation of his right to terminate the interrogation; 3) based on defendant's acquiescence in the accuracy of the content of the media coverage, as well as the relative ease with which a jury was empaneled, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a change of venue; 4) the jurors were not required to be totally unaware of the facts and issues involved in the case as long as they could set aside their impressions or opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court; 5) the evidence showed aggravated battery and depravity of mind within the meaning of Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court found that: (1) the denial of defendant's motion for separate trials for the offenses involving each woman was not an abuse of discretion; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to strike jury members, or in denying his motion to strike the entire panel when one member became ill just before trial; (3) a DNA test was a reliable scientific technique; (4) Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-270.5, which governed DNA evidence, did not shift the burden to defendant and was not unconstitutionally vague; (5) the probative value of defendant's DNA test outweighed its prejudicial effect; (6) the surviving victim's in-court identification was reliable under a totality of the circumstances; (7) a witness's identification of defendant from a police car twenty minutes after her encounter was not unduly suggestive; (8) the imposition of the death sentence was not a result of passion or prejudice; and (9) given the brutality of the murder and the fact that the jury found future dangerousness and vileness, pursuant to Va.

Abuser filed a plea invoking Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-243. Survivor argued that her suit was timely filed under 1991 Va. Acts ch. 674.

Code Ann. &sect; 58.1-1826 on the grounds that the Commonwealth unconstitutionally taxed their federal retirement incomes and that state law required the refund of those taxes collected during the three-year period preceding a decision of the Supreme Court in another case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed their suits for refunds following a decision of the Supreme Court that state taxation of pension income of retired federal government employees, while exempting from taxation pension income of retired state government employees, was unconstitutional. The court held that this decision was not to be applied retroactively and, accordingly, that the taxpayers were not entitled to a refund. The Supreme Court vacated the court's decision and remanded these cases for further consideration in light of a second Supreme Court case, in which a plurality held that it was error to refuse to apply a rule of federal law retroactively after the case announcing the rule had already done so. The court held that the Supreme Court did not hold in the first case that its rule applied retroactively to the litigants in that case and, in fact, did not even consider the issue. Thus, the court was not foreclosed by precedent from applying the three-pronged Chevron Oil test in deciding the retroactivity issue in the present case and it concluded that nothing articulated in the Supreme Court's second case required a different result from that reached in the court's prior decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A circuit court declared invalid appellant county's zoning ordinance amendment (ZOA). On appeal, the court held that, because appellant board of supervisors found that all four fundamental purposes of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-491(g) required its action, the statement of purpose for the ZOA was sufficient to meet the requirement of &sect; 15.1-491(g). Because the enactment of the ZOA was a legislative rather than adjudicative or quasi-judicial exercise, the constitutional right of procedural due process did not apply, and appellant county had only to meet the statutory notice and hearing requirements of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-493, which the trial court found were met. Because four documents, which referenced the recommendations of the county planning commission, were sufficiently identified in appellant board's ZOA motions package, the documents were properly incorporated by reference therein. Finally, the court held that, because appellant board's staff did not, in preparing the full text of the ZOA after it was enacted, make any substantive changes to the ZOA, the trial court erred in finding that appellant board unlawfully delegated legislative power to its staff. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctors, who were not participating physicians within the meaning of the act because they were not obstetricians and did not perform obstetrical services, challenged the act because they were required to pay an annual assessment to fund the program. The doctors argued the act violated Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14 and 15 because it constituted a special law that removed certain claims against certain physicians from the traditional tort system. On review, the court found that the act did not violate the prohibition against special legislation because the removal of the claims of neurologically injured infants from the tort system decreased the medical malpractice insurance premiums for all physicians. Thus the classification was not arbitrary and bore a reasonable and substantial relation to a legitimate state interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia) granted appellee newspaper's petition for writ of mandamus to compel appellant records custodian to produce the itemized billings for each long-distance call made from the governor's office. The trial court found that the information did not come within the pertinent exception to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2.1-340 et seq. The records custodian appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper sought an itemized list of long distance telephone calls placed by the governor's office pursuant to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (Act), Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.1-340 et seq. The records custodian produced only the aggregate monthly charges for various phone services but refused to produce a list of itemized calls showing the numbers called to which cities and the charges therefor. The court found that the itemized billings were exempted from disclosure under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.1-342(b)(4) of the Act reasoning that to require mandatory disclosure of the billing information would have violated the separation of powers doctrine in Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 and art. III, &sect; 1. The court found that disclosure of the information requested could have a chilling effect on the governor's use of the telephone to conduct the state's business and may chill those who would otherwise offer valuable consultation to the governor. The court further found that the purpose of the Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.1-340 et seq., to promote a policy of openness in government, did not outweigh the disruption that required disclosure would have imposed on the governor in executing his duties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensed motor vehicles dealers commenced an action challenging the amendment to Va. Va. Code Ann. Ann. &sect; 46.2-1508, which required a person licensed as a dealer in another state to obtain a certificate of dealer registration prior to selling vehicles at auctions in Virginia. The circuit court determined that the statute was constitutional, and the court affirmed. The court held that the statutory scheme imposed only an incidental burden upon interstate commerce, which was not excessive in relation to the public benefits it provided, and did not offend the Commerce Clause. Further, the effect of the 1988 amendments imposed uniformity upon the regulation of sales of motor vehicles in Virginia, and did not discriminate among classes of dealers. The purpose was to afford uniform protection to those who purchased vehicles at wholesale auctions, for the ultimate benefit of consumers who purchased the vehicles at retail. The state had a valid continuing interest in the protection of the public from fraud, and the means chosen effectively serve that interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found: (1) the trial court ruled correctly in denying defendant's request to submit a questionnaire to each venireman for completion because the opportunity to see and hear the veniremen, when questioned during voir dire, was crucial to the effective discharge of the trial judge's responsibility; (2) the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion for a bill of particulars because the indictment gave notice of the nature and character of the offense charged, so defendant could have made his defense; (3) defendant had the benefit of all the discovery to which he was entitled as there was no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case; (4) the trial court correctly excluded jurors for cause who stated that they were unwilling to impose the death penalty; and (5) the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's tendered instruction that except in the case of murder for hire, only the actual perpetrator of the killing may have been convicted because where two or more persons take a direct part in inflicting fatal injuries, each joint participant was an immediate perpetrator for the purposes of the capital murder statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff neighbors filed an action against defendant cattle farm, seeking a declaratory judgment that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 55-317, the division fence law, violated the Virginia Constitution's prohibition against special legislation as applied to them. The Circuit Court of Caroline County (Virginia) found in favor of the neighbors, and the farm appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The law provided that when an owner of land that was subdivided or that was used for industrial or commercial purposes was given notice by an adjoining landowner that the adjoining landowner planned to fence his land, he was required to be liable for half of its cost. The neighbors lived on subdivided property adjoining the farm. The court rejected the neighbors' argument that the law unreasonably favored farm owners over owners of subdivided, commercial, or industrial property, stating that the essence of prohibited special legislation was the existence of an arbitrary separation of persons, places, or things of the same general class. Stating that a law could not be declared to be unreasonable or arbitrary when any state of facts could be reasonably conceived that would support it, it stated that here, the legislature was motivated by the possibility of livestock roaming through residential, commercial, and industrial property. Allowing farm owners to force lot owners to share fencing costs would ensure continuity of fencing, it held, whereas a decision otherwise could result in a mixture of fenced and unfenced lots adjoining farmland.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action filed by neighbors against a cattle farm, the court reversed the trial court's declaratory judgment that Virginia's division fence law was unconstitutional special legislation as applied to the neighbors.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had previously been convicted of murder for hire.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder for hire and sentenced to death. After a writ of habeas corpus was granted with regard to his sentence, a new sentencing hearing was conducted. Defendant was again sentenced to death and appealed pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 17-110.1. On appeal, the court affirmed the sentence. The court held that allowing defendant to be shackled in front of the jury was not prejudicial error because it was not per se unconstitutional, and it was necessary to protect the people in the court and society at large. It was not an abuse of discretion to allow the transcript of the guilt phase to be used at the sentencing hearing because guilt was not an issue in the new sentencing hearing, and the court limited its purpose to the nature of the offense and the circumstances under which it was committed. Also, the utility of cross-examination was remote because the testimony was during trial, with an opportunity for cross-examination, so the trustworthiness was established beyond doubt. The state's use of its peremptory challenges was not racially discriminatory because the prosecutor met his burden of showing there was a neutral explanation for striking each juror.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's death sentence because the trial court did not commit reversible error in its rulings to allow defendant to be shackled in front of the jury or its ruling to allow portions of the guilt phase transcript to be used during the sentencing hearing. The trial court's finding that the state's peremptory challenges were racially motivated was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal employees sought reimbursement of state income taxes previously paid on their federal pensions after the United States Supreme Court held that their federal pensions could not be taxed by the state. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that the decision should only be applied prospectively. The court applied a three-pronged test to determine whether the decision should be applied prospectively. First, the decision established a new principle of law. Previous cases discussing the intergovernmental tax immunity were decided on the proposition that the tax placed a foreseeable and direct burden on some federal operation; the state legislature could not have been expected to perceive that its taxing scheme would have placed a foreseeable burden on some federal operation. Second, because the state legislature corrected its statute after the Supreme Court decision, applying the decision retroactively would not retard or further the purpose of the intergovernmental tax immunity. Finally, retroactive application of the decision would adversely affect the state's financial stability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state bar initiated disciplinary proceedings against the attorney for alleged fraudulent conduct. The complaint was referred for investigation to the district committee of the bar, which filed a complaint under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 54.1-3935 in the circuit court. After a hearing, the circuit court found by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney intentionally misrepresented material facts to two insurers by submitting 12 bills to each company for the same charges. As a result, the circuit court suspended his license to practice law for one year. On review, the attorney argued that the proceeding before the district committee was in violation of the rules of the state supreme court and denied him due process and equal protection of the laws. The appeals court ruled that the proceeding before the district committee was proper under Va. Sup. Ct. Rule part 6, &sect; IV, para. 13(B)(5)(a). The court also rejected the attorney's argument that the proceeding in the circuit was constitutionally inferior to an administrative proceeding because the only reason the case was not handled administratively was that one of the board members was the author of the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his capital murder conviction and death sentenced imposed by the Circuit Court of Fauquier County (Virginia). The defendant was found guilty by a jury of capital murder, Va. Code &sect; 18.2-31(6), and of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony under Va. Code &sect; 18.2-53.1. The jury fixed the defendant's punishment at death for capital murder, based upon his &quot;future dangerousness.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant challenged his capital murder conviction and death sentence, arguing that the trial court erred by refusing to give the defendant's proposed statement explaining the process of voir dire to prospective jurors. The defendant also complained that certain evidence was improperly admitted that bolstered the state's witnesses. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that the trial court did not commit any errors detrimental to the defendant. The court found that it must give deference to the trial court's decision whether to retain or exclude individual veniremen because the trial court saw and heard the juror. For that reason, the court reasoned that the trial court's decision in that regard would not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of manifest error. The court further found that improper evidence had not been allowed at trial. The court also held that the defendant waived his right to counsel during his interrogation and that the evidence from that interrogation was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-255.2 violated her rights to due process and equal protection. The statute created a separate and distinct felony, with additional punishment. The court reversed the dismissal of the charge because the offense reflected the general assembly's concern about the aggravated nature of drug transactions involving children. Such transactions were the cause of harm to children. It was irrelevant when the drug transactions took place. The statute was rationally related to the commonwealth's interest in protecting children from such threatened harm. Therefore, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated and it was error to dismiss the charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 8.01-250 related to a legitimate state objective finding that construction contracts were expected to last many years and absent a statute of repose a contractor or others would have otherwise exposed to long-term liability. The court also found that &sect; 8.01-20 did not violate equal protection, as it did not give preferential treatment to contractors or others. The court found that since the classification did not infringe a fundamental right nor was it based on a suspect class it only had a satisfy a rational basis test.

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(5). Defendant was sentenced to life in prison for the rape, 20 years for the burglary, and death for the capital murder. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence of defendant's involvement in three other rape-murders was admissible to establish his identity as the perpetrator because there were numerous similarities between the offenses, particularly the indications of a common modus operandi and the scientific evidence that defendant was the common criminal agent. The trial court's denial of defendant's motions for mistrial, based on disruptions of his trial, was not error because the trial court gave the jury a prompt and appropriate curative instruction. Polymerase 9 chain reaction (PCR) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test results were admissible because the trial court found, based upon credible and unrefuted evidence, that they were sufficiently reliable. The submission to the jury of circumstantial evidence, such as defendant's propensity to frequent certain malls where several victims went, was not an abuse of discretion because inferences could reasonably be drawn therefrom that tended to establish the probability of defendant's guilt and the weight of the evidence was left to the jury. With respect to the sentence of death, the evidence clearly demonstrated defendant's future dangerousness and the vileness of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined to set aside the sentence of death imposed upon defendant. Thus, court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for rape, breaking and entering, and capital murder.</SPAN></P>

During the penalty phase, the commonwealth introduced expert testimony regarding his future dangerousness. The trial court sentenced defendant to the death penalty. Before the court was defendant's appeal of his capital murder conviction and the automatic review of his death sentence. The court affirmed both. Based on defendant's voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty, the assignments of error raised with regard to his capital murder conviction were waived. When defendant requested a psychiatric examination in order to prove a mental-status defense; he waived his right to raise a fifth amendment challenge to the commonwealth's use of evidence obtained therefrom. Moreover, defendant's sixth amendment right to counsel was not violated based on the fact that he was never advised that his evaluation could result in testimony of future dangerousness. Hence, the expert testimony regarding the same was admissible. Nothing suggested that the trial court acted out of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor in imposing the death sentence, and the sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Augusta County (Virginia), which sustained a demurrer by defendant Board of Supervisors of Augusta County (board) and imposed the sanction of a private reprimand upon the attorney for frivolous litigation pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-271.1. The attorney had sought a declaratory judgment on the board's power to move the &quot;county seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney claimed that the county's administrative offices were a part of the &quot;county seat&quot; or &quot;courthouse,&quot; and that the board's action to remove the county seat required an election under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-559. After the attorney's appeal on the demurrer failed, the trial court imposed the sanction because the attorney's allegations of law did not meet the statutory requirement of &quot;objective reasonableness&quot; under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-271.1. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that as a matter of law the attorney's contention that removal of the county seat required an election was reasonable under the circumstances. The court found that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-559 spoke of removal of courthouses in its title but described courthouses as &quot;county seats&quot; in its text. It also found that the attorney relied on two precedent cases that dealt with the removal of courthouses or county seats and which held that the terms &quot;courthouse&quot; and &quot;county seat&quot; were synonymous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an infant born with birth defects and her parents, brought suit against defendant doctor. The doctor sought to limit their recovery to the medical malpractice cap contained in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.15. The district court denied this motion and the doctor sought review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit of the award of damages. That court certified questions of Virginia law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The infant lacked oxygen prior to delivery and was born with birth defects. She and her parents sought damages from the doctor who delivered her for medical malpractice, bodily injury, mental anguish, emotional distress, and personal injuries. The infant died after the verdicts were returned, but before judgment was rendered. The jury award exceeded the statutory cap and the doctor challenged the award. The court held that (1) the infant had a claim against the doctor and was entitled to a separate statutory cap because she was his patient within the meaning of the state Medical Malpractice Act, (2) the parents' claims for emotional distress and medical expenses were derivative of the infant's claim and that amount had been exhausted by the infant's claim, (3) the statutory cap extinguished the awards of punitive damages, (4) Virginia law did not permit recovery for loss of enjoyment of life as a separate element of damages, (5) the infant did not carry her burden of proof to recover damages for her lost earning capacity, and (6) Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-21 did not require the parties to convert the action to a wrongful death action and the entry of final judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statutory cap applied individually to the infant and her mother and that the cap applied to damages for the infliction of emotional distress and punitive damages. The court held that Virginia law did not allow recovery for the loss of enjoyment of life and that the infant was unable to recover damages for her lost earning capacity. The court held that the action did not have to be converted to a wrongful death action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Prince William County (Virginia), which convicted defendant of capital murder in the willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of a law enforcement officer for the purpose of interfering with the performance of the officer's official duties under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(f), and sentenced defendant to death pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Virginia's capital murder scheme was constitutional, that a statement made by defendant was voluntary, and that a juror did not have to be dismissed. The court held evidence of prior offenses was admissible because it showed premeditation, absence of mistake, motive or intent. State expert testimony was properly admitted. The court held that defendant's psychiatric expert was properly excluded because mental state was immaterial to specific intent. Premeditation necessary for first degree murder was the adoption of specific intent to kill. The court held that voluntary intoxication could not negate specific intent and that the expert's testimony did not bear on inability to form intent. The court held that exclusion of a prior consistent statement was proper, that the evidence was sufficient, and that the jury instructions were proper. Late compliance with discovery did not require exclusion of state evidence, a mistrial was not required, use of a pre-sentence report by the judge but not the jury was proper, and the death sentence was not disproportionate or based on passion but was properly based on aggravating factors of future dangerousness and vileness.</SPAN></P>

The alleged negligent acts occurred while the patient was receiving treatment in the hospital. Therefore, he was receiving &quot;health care&quot; as defined by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-581.1. Additionally, the alleged tort was based on health care or professional services rendered to the patient, which constituted &quot;malpractice.&quot; Finally, the patient conceded that the health care he received was rendered by &quot;health care providers.&quot; The court applied the &quot;plain meaning&quot; rule and concluded that the allegations in the patient's amended motion for judgment brought the action within the purview of the Virginia Medical Malpractice Act.

The only testimony in support of the application was given by one of the landowners, whose statements related primarily to their need for migrant labor. Thus, the board failed to make appropriate findings supported by the record or to state appropriate conclusions supported by the record to render the issue fairly debatable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in prison for murder, defendant inmate was assigned to a work detail.

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress his incriminatory statements was supported by the record, which established that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. The court also held that: (1) defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court's ruling that the state was entitled to discovery of mitigating factors under Va. Code. Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.4(B). (2) The jurors were able to render a fair verdict, and defendant had no right to propound questions exploring what jurors heard about the case. (3) Defendant was a &quot;prisoner&quot; for purposes of establishing an element of capital murder under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(c) (1988).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee trustee brought an action to determine whether a racial provision in the trust it administered was enforceable, who the trust's proper income beneficiary was, and what the rights were of the private schools who were the income beneficiaries under the trust. In a consolidated appeal, the court reversed the trial court's finding that the racial conditions of the trust were unconstitutional and void and that appellee primary beneficiary therefore was the sole beneficiary of the trust as long as its school operated. The court rendered judgment in favor of appellant final beneficiary and held that the trust language divesting the intermediate beneficiaries of their interest in the event they admitted non-white students was a special limitation, not a condition subsequent, and therefore their admission of non-white students divested their beneficial interest and it fell to appellant final beneficiary. The court affirmed the holding that the doctrine of cy pres did not apply because there was no uncertainty regarding the trust's beneficiaries or purpose, there was a valid gift to appellant final beneficiary, and, therefore, there was no need to search for the testator's intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of judgments from the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia) convicting him of capital murder and sentencing him to death in one action and convicting him of rape, forcible sodomy, and burglary and sentencing him to life imprisonment for both the rape and sodomy convictions and at 20 years' imprisonment for the burglary conviction, in another action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a bifurcated trial, defendant was convicted of capital murder, rape and forcible sodomy of the murdered victim, and burglary. Defendant was sentenced to death, life imprisonment, and 20 years' imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgments from the trial court. The court rejected defendant's constitutionality challenge to the death penalty statute holding that the death penalty did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant contended that the testimony from an assistant lab director on the admissibility of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) print identification evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial and that the trial court, therefore, violated his right to due process. The court rejected defendant's contentions. The assistant lab director's qualifications were substantial and unchallenged by defendant. Whether the assistant lab director qualified as an expert was a matter within the trial court's sound discretion and the court found no abuse of discretion. The undisputed evidence established that the DNA print identification test was properly conducted. The court concluded that defendant's sentence of death was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Virginia (state) challenged an order from the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, Virginia, which dismissed the state's suit against appellee asbestos manufacturer because Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-250 had extinguished the state's cause of action. The state argued that governmental immunity applied to the application of &sect; 8.01-250 and the legislature's enactment of &sect; 8.01-250 violated the state's due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Virginia (state) brought an action seeking to recover the costs of abating the hazard of building materials containing asbestos that were installed in 1,016 public buildings and facilities. The trial court dismissed the state's action because of the Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-250&nbsp;statute of repose. The state argued that governmental immunity applied to the application of &sect; 8.01-250 and the legislature's enactment of &sect; 8.01-250 violated the state's due process rights. The court affirmed, and held that constitutionally protected &quot;substantive rights of repose&quot; accrued to a potential defendant when the five-year period prescribed by &sect; 8.01-250 had run. The court reasoned that the state legislature intended that &sect; 8.01-250 benefit manufacturers of ordinary building materials, as opposed to manufacturers of machinery and equipment. A &quot;window of opportunity,&quot; even one as brief as 30 days, was ordinarily sufficient to satisfy due process requirements when a newly-created time bar was applied to existing causes of action and accrued rights of action. The court concluded that the enactment of &sect; 8.01-250 had not impaired any of the state's constitutionally protected rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant cross-appealed the order insofar as it ordered defendant to reimburse plaintiff for a retroactive assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff health care facility owned and operated a facility for the elderly and was granted tax-exempt status by defendant city. Two years later, defendant assessed taxes against plaintiff for the current year and for the preceding two years. Plaintiff paid under protest and brought an action challenging defendant's actions, arguing that it was entitled to tax exempt status because it was a nonprofit religious association whose property was used exclusively for charitable purposes. A trial court ruled that plaintiff did not qualify for tax exemption, but ordered defendant to refund plaintiff for taxes paid for the first two years, holding that defendant was estopped from retroactively assessing taxes. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that defendant, even though it had contracted formally to exempt plaintiff's property from taxation, was not estopped from making a later assessment where the property did not fall within any exempted class. Given plaintiff's proper tax status, the trial court erred in applying the doctrine of estoppel for prior years' assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that plaintiff health care facility was not entitled to tax exempt status to avoid payment of taxes for the current year because it did not fall under any statutory category permitting such status. The court also reversed the decision insofar as it held that defendant city was estopped from assessing taxes for prior years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the victim was found dead in the ransacked bedroom of her townhouse, defendant was indicted for capital murder and rape, Va.

The court held that the death penalty did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The exclusion of jurors who would not impose the death penalty did not violate either the federal or the state constitutions. The court held that the jury's acceptance of the medical examiner's testimony concerning the presence of sperm in the victim's vagina was sufficient to support the finding that penetration occurred and that a rape was committed. The court held that defendant's conduct was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman, in that it involved torture, depravity of mind and aggravated battery to the victim, Va.

The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury that mirrored the racial composition of the community; as defendant did not allege that minorities were systematically excluded from juries over a period of time, underrepresentation of minorities on his jury was not reversible error. The admission of the tape recorded conversations was proper. Defendant's girlfriend and her brother consented to record the conversations and there was no evidence that such consent was coerced. Defendant's confessions were sufficiently corroborated by the evidence; consequently, the confessions were properly admitted and defendant's request for a jury instruction describing the confessions as uncorroborated was properly denied.

The board's fact-finding panel had determined there was no basis for dismissal or probation of the teacher.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was placed on probation for improper conduct, the teacher was accused of engaging in further inappropriate conduct. While recommending that no action be taken, a fact-finding panel requested by the teacher under Va. Code &sect; 22.1-310 found that he had suggested to his class that they perform skits of a lynching and Nazi rally, he told them how to make bombs, and he referred to other teachers and the school board in offensive terms. In deciding to dismiss the teacher, the board made its own findings that included disruptive and inappropriate conduct not found by the panel. On judicial review, the circuit court ordered the teacher's reinstatement, ruling that the board's findings were not supported by substantial evidence. In reversing on appeal, the court ruled that the board's findings were supported by substantial evidence. The board was not required to accord the weight given jury verdicts to the panel's findings. Nothing in Va. Code &sect;&sect; 22.1-310 to 22.1-313 provided that the panel's findings were binding on the board. Rather, the board had authority under Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7, to supervise the schools and protect students from inappropriate conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decree of the circuit court was reversed and final judgment was entered confirming the board's decision to dismiss the teacher.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for killing his father, stepmother, and two stepbrothers. He was also convicted of first-degree murder and for the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony with regard to each of those killings. He appealed the capital and the non-capital convictions from the Circuit Court of Amherst County (Virginia), which were consolidated with the automatic penalty review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that he could only be indicted for one capital murder when he killed four people in a narrow time frame. On appeal, the court determined that the Commonwealth was free to indict him for as many separate crimes as it thought it could prove in good faith. It was not required to make an election. The court held that the indictments were proper. He had fair notice of what he was required to defend against at trial. The court also found that the trial court was not required to permit a closed individual voir dire and did allow an individual voir dire on the first day of trial. Nor did the trial court err in refusing two questions the defendant wanted to pose to prospective jurors. One was ambiguous and unfocused; the other was the start of a fishing expedition. The defendant argued that he was entitled to second-degree murder instructions, but the court found that such instructions are appropriate only where supported by evidence. The court found that the defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated. If convicted of a lesser-included and greater offense, the proper remedy is to vacate the lesser-included conviction and leave the greater offense conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the capital murder conviction, the remaining first-degree murder convictions, and the firearm convictions. The court set aside the defendant's first-degree murder conviction for killing his father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners applied for rezoning of an acre of land from limited office use to general commercial office use. After receiving a negative response, the landowners withdrew their application and resubmitted it with several proffers. Subsequently, appellees undertook a revision of the zoning ordinance to impose additional use conditions on commercial property. The landowners then sued appellees, claiming that their actions were invalid and illegal. The trial court sustained appellees' demurrer to the landowners' complaint on the ground the landowners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The landowners appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. The landowners were not required to resort to administrative remedies. The decision to grant or deny a special use permit was a legislative, not an administrative function. The landowners, by submitting their proffers, had fully run the legislative gauntlet once and in the midst of that process appellees undertook a revision of the zoning ordinance. This action by appellees did not require the landowners to resort to the legislative process a second time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, infant and parents, filed actions against defendant obstetrician for alleged medical malpractice in the delivery of plaintiff infant. The trial court entered a judgment for defendant and plaintiffs sought review. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of defendant. The court found no error in the trial court's rulings concerning plaintiff infant's personal injury claim and to plaintiff parents' claim for past and future medical expenses. The court concluded that the refusal to allow plaintiffs to examine the jury panel about a medical malpractice insurance crisis was not an abuse of discretion because it would have injected the subject of insurance into the trial and impaired the jurors' impartiality. The court held that the admission of a medical review panel's opinion into evidence did not violate plaintiffs' right to a trial by jury. Admission of the panel's opinion did not impinge upon the jury's function of resolving disputed facts. The court determined that the trial court did not err in ruling that plaintiff parents did not have a right of action for emotional distress because their claim was wholly derivative of plaintiff infant's claim.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and sentence. First, the court held that the death penalty statute was constitutional and did not violate any provisions of the state of federal constitutions. Secondly, the court held that the evidence was more than sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Thirdly, the court held that given the vileness of the offense and defendant's possibility of committing future offenses, the death penalty was properly imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supplier filed a declaratory judgment action to challenge the validity of the Virginia Wine Franchise Act (act) after the suppliers filed complaints to the department alleging that the act forbade supplier's unilateral termination of at-will contracts with wholesalers.

The trial court held that portions of the act that offended the Commerce Clause were severable, and that the act did not impair contracts. On appeal, the court held that the imposition of retroactive application of the act upon the supplier's discretionary right to terminate contracts was a severe alteration of contractual obligations in violation of the Contract Clause, Va.

The act also violated the Commerce Clause where it required supplier to impose the same amendment in every other state as amendments it desired to make to its Virginia contracts.

The court reversed the judgment for the city and zoning administrator. Because the ordinance did not generally ban billboards everywhere, but rather distinguished between permissible and impermissible signs according to their subject matter, the court held that the deferential time, place, and manner balancing test did not apply. The court held that because the ordinance permitted the display of a sign that pertained to the activities, commercial or noncommercial, performed on the premises, while banning the same sign for noncommercial messages unrelated to the activities performed on that location, the ordinance's restriction on noncommercial speech abridged the freedom of speech as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with capital murder, first-degree murder, and use of a firearm in the killings.

Defendant was identified as the shooter in both cases and the same gun was used for each of the shootings. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

The evidence that defendant was involved in other shootings was admissible to link him to the murder weapon and thereby identify him as the killer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The booksellers filed an action against the commonwealth seeking to enjoin enforcement of the 1985 amendments to Va.

On appeal, the United States Supreme Court certified to the court the question of whether the booksellers' exhibits were &quot;harmful to juveniles&quot; under Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-390, 18.2-391 (1982, Supp. 1987), which the court answered in the negative. The Supreme Court also certified the question of whether the booksellers with an anti-perusal policy complied with Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-391(a) (Supp. 1987), even though no action regarding the display of restricted materials was taken, which the court answered in the affirmative. The court held that the test to be applied to determine whether the books were harmful to juveniles was that the material had to: 1) predominantly appeal to the prurient, shameful, or morbid interest of juveniles; 2) be patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what was suitable for juveniles; and 3) taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered in the negative the certified question as to whether the phrase &quot;harmful to juveniles&quot; encompassed the booksellers' exhibits. The court answered in the affirmative the certified question as to whether booksellers with anti-perusal policies complied with a commonwealth statute.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that as an indigent, his due process rights were violated when the trial court refused to grant him a continuance to permit another evaluation by a second psychiatrist at state expense. The court held the defendant was not entitled to select his examining psychiatrist if the state was paying for the examination and defendant was not entitled to a second psychiatric examination at state expense where the Commonwealth already had paid for his first examination. The court also rejected defendant's contention that his counsel was unconstitutionally excluded from post-line-up police interviews of identifying witnesses, holding that defendant had no constitutional right to require his counsel's presence at the interviews. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue because defendant failed to establish such a pervasive prejudice among the citizens of the venue of the crime as to make it reasonably certain that defendant would not have received a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the court held that a Department of Taxation could equitably adjust taxes where there was (1) an arrangement (2) between two commonly owned corporations (3) in such a manner improperly, inaccurately, or incorrectly to reflect (4) the business done or the Virginia taxable income earned from business done in this State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sunday-closing laws at issue, Va.

The merchants and others argued that the Sunday-closing laws, as applied to them, denied them the equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court held that the statutes did not violate equal protection, but they were special laws prohibited by Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14, 15 and thus were unconstitutional and void. The court found that the laws did not affect all persons similarly situated or engaged in the same business without discrimination, and the statutory scheme did not bear a reasonable and substantial relationship to the object sought to be accomplished by the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor publisher challenged the decision of the Circuit Court of the City of Winchester (Virginia), which entered several protective orders in a wrongful death action that sealed the discovery data, pleadings, and all the records in that action, including the final order approving a compromise settlement between plaintiff executrix and defendant corporations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that subject to statutory exceptions, a rebuttable presumption of public access applied in civil proceedings to judicial records, which included the pleadings and any exhibits or motions filed by the parties and all orders entered by the trial court in the judicial proceedings leading to the judgment. To overcome that presumption, the moving party had to establish an interest so compelling that it could not be protected reasonably by some measure other than a protective order and any such order had to be drafted in the manner least restrictive of the public's interest. The court found that the trial court struck the wrong balance. The public had a societal interest in learning whether compromise settlements in a wrongful death action were equitable and whether the courts were administering properly the powers conferred upon them to approve such settlements. The court held that the trial court had good cause pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 4:1(c) to enter the pre-judgment protective orders sealing the pretrial documents and that the publisher did not have a common-law right of access to information collected through discovery that was not a matter of public record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the final judgment insofar as it approved the compromise settlement. The court reversed the order that sealed the judicial records and remanded the action for a further hearing, limited to the question of whether the judicial records should remain sealed. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to seal the information collected through discovery that was not a matter of public record.</SPAN></P>

The client challenged that ruling, and the court agreed with the trial court that the contract limitations period applied to the legal malpractice claim.

The court held that the laborers were not statutory employees as defined in the LHWCA, based on a two-pronged coverage test involving the situs of the injury and the status of the injured worker. Covered workers were those involved in the essential elements of unloading a vessel, those directly involved in the loading or unloading function, and those who spent at least some of their time in indisputable longshoreman operations. Because the laborers performed purely housekeeping and janitorial tasks, they were not involved in the essential elements of loading or unloading a vessel and therefore were not covered by the LHWCA.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the legislature intended to punish conspiracies to commit more serious drug offenses more severely. To determine the punishment for conspiracy to distribute various drugs, reference is made to the punishment for distribution of the various drugs, which varies depending upon the level of seriousness assessed by the legislature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On a writ of habeas corpus appeal, the United States Supreme Court overturned defendant's death sentence but not his conviction. The case was remanded for a new sentencing hearing where the death sentence was again imposed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to exclude a juror because review of his entire voir dire examination did not demonstrate any bias that would have prevented or substantially impaired his duties. The court also held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.3(C) did not violate the ex post facto clause because the amendment was procedural, in that it allowed a new jury to resentence a defendant as opposed to the previous requirement that the old jury reconvene. The court found that the statutory language in &sect; 19.2-264.2 defining &quot;vileness&quot; as a predicate to imposing the death penalty was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court also held that the evidence supported the jury's finding that defendant committed an &quot;aggravated battery&quot; as a statutory predicate for imposing the death penalty. The court held that defendant's sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment, the court noted that it had disposed of the constitutional challenges to the death penalty statute in previous cases. The court found no error in the jury selection. The gun was legally seized because it was in the officers' plain view. The court noted that minutes before the seizure, the arresting officers received a message of the murder of which defendant was ultimately convicted, including a description of defendant, the car, its other occupants, and the gun. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Attorney General of Virginia filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against defendant Comptroller of Virginia to establish the constitutionality of various provisions of 1986 Va. Acts ch. 13 (Act), which made substantial changes to the State Revenue Bond Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 33.1-267 to 33.1-295 and to legislation providing sources of revenue for the repayment of revenue bonds to be issued to fund highway-related capital improvements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act at issue established a new approach to financing the state's transportation needs by extending the revenue bond concept from bonds secured only by a pledge of project-derived tolls and user fees to bonds secured by a pledge of highway user revenues, including taxes and fees related to motor vehicles. The comptroller argued that the highway user revenue bonds called for by the Act were debts proscribed by Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 9. The attorney general argued that the bonds fell with the special fund provisions of Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 9(d). The court found that the special fund provisions did not apply, and thus the bond were illegal, because the payment on the bonds was not limited to revenues from the project thus created but could be paid out of monies generated from taxes and fees that went into the general fund. The court also found that the Act violated Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 7, because the length of the proposed bonds exceeded the two and one-half year limitation on appropriations. Finally, the court found that the Act violated Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15, because the pledge of taxes to secure the bonds would be irrevocable during the life of the bonds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division, certified the question whether the time limit in Va.

I, &sect; 11 (due process clause) as applied to the 1986 complaint of plaintiffs, city and school board, which sought damages from defendants, manufacturers of asbestos products, related to asbestos products placed in schools between 1939 and 1971.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Va. Code &sect; 8.01-250, which barred claims for damages resulting from construction of improvements to real property brought more than five years after the performance or furnishing of such construction, was not a statute of limitations but a statute of repose, which extinguished the rights of the school board and city. The court held that the rights bestowed by &sect; 8.01-250 upon the manufacturers (which arose when the statutory period expired) were substantive if not vested and, as such, were not impaired by retroactive application of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-250.1, which revived or extended actions against a manufacturer or supplier of asbestos or material containing asbestos otherwise barred prior to July 1, 1990, as a result of expiration of the applicable period of limitation. The court held that while the legislature's police power included the power to enact a statute reasonably designed to protect society against the health hazard posed by asbestos products installed in buildings frequented by the public at large, &sect; 8.01-250.1 was not such a statute, having been designed primarily to relieve budgetary concerns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee had a sublease with the oil company for the land on which the gasoline station was located. The oil company had a lease on that land and it advised the lessee to cancel his lease with the company and to enter a direct lease with the landowner. The lessee, therefore, signed a cancellation of the lease and later discovered that the landowner would not lease the land to him. The parties agreed that the applicable statute of limitations was five years for the actions in fraud and in conspiracy to injure the lessee in his business. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the oil company, holding that the cause of action accrued when the lessee signed the cancellation of his lease with the oil company. The court reasoned that the lessee was injured and sustained damages at that time that he signed the cancellation, and that the action accrued when he discovered that the landowner would not grant him a lease. That was the date that he discovered his injury and that event occurred more than five years before his actions were filed. Thus, his actions were barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder in the commission of robbery, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(d), abduction, the use of a firearm in the commission of each of those felonies, and arson. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that, based on the totality of all the surrounding circumstances, defendant's statements to the police were made freely, knowingly, and voluntarily and his Miranda rights were not violated. From a totality of all the circumstances, the court also concluded that defendant's consent to search his automobile was given freely and voluntarily. The court held that the privilege rule applied and the trial court did not err in its ruling that an informant's identity did not have to be exposed. The commonwealth's removal for cause of the six veniremen who voiced absolute objections to imposing the death penalty was accomplished pursuant to a non-discriminatory criterion.</SPAN></P>

The attorney settled the workers' compensation claim for $ 15,000, but the commission awarded him a fee of only $ 2,500, so he obtained another $ 2,500 directly from the claimant. The state bar determined that the fee was illegal, and it publicly reprimanded the attorney for violating DR 2-105, relating to illegal and clearly excessive fees. The attorney appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the commission had full power to control the award of fees in workers' compensation cases, pursuant to &sect; 65.1-102, and any fee in addition thereto was illegal. This section did not violate equal protection and it was not impermissibly vague so as to be a violation of due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor who filed a suit against his mother as the result of an accident that arose when a gear in an automobile that the minor was a passenger spontaneously shifted into reverse, appealed the judgment that sustained the mother's plea of release. The issue raised on review was whether, under the circumstances of the case, retroactive application of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-35.1 (1979) would impair any substantive right of the mother. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court correctly sustained the mother's plea of release. Further, the court held that the case involved the ability of the non-settling tort-feasor to be released when the minor had released another joint wrongdoer. The court reasoned that regardless of any effect the federal order or change in the ad damnum may have had on the mother's ability to seek contribution, the mother's substantive right, manifested by her ability to defend successfully the suit after the minor had released the car maker, would have been impaired if the statute was permitted to operate retroactively. Therefore, the court concluded that the application of the statute to the facts was constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client argued that the court should apply a &quot;continuing agency&quot; rule to his claim for legal malpractice. The attorneys responded that some attorney-client relationships last a lifetime, and that to require a firm to maintain readiness to defend itself against claims dating back to the beginning of such relationships would impose the very burden the statute of limitations was designed to alleviate. On appeal, the court held that when malpractice was claimed to have occurred during the representation of a client by an attorney with respect to a particular undertaking or transaction, the breach of duty occurred and the statute of limitations began to run when the attorney's services rendered in connection with that particular undertaking had terminated, notwithstanding the continuation of a general attorney-client relationship, and irrespective of the attorney's work on other undertakings for the same client. The court found that the undertaking entrusted to the attorneys required a continuing or recurring course of professional services over a period of time, and that the claim was filed within three years of the last related professional service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to capital murder and the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and was sentenced to death for capital murder and a two-year prison term for firearm use. On a consolidated appeal, the court affirmed. The court summarily disposed of numerous errors assigned by defendant because convictions based on guilty pleas were not appealable in the absence of a jurisdictional defect. The court summarily dismissed defendant's arguments as to the constitutionality of the death penalty that had been previously considered and rejected. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to a second independent psychiatrist, that evidence of defendant's juvenile offenses and unadjudicated criminal activity was properly admitted in the penalty phase, and that sufficient evidence supported all the factors relied upon by the trial court to determine defendant's future dangerousness pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.2. The court further found that the death sentence was not excessive, disproportionate, or imposed with passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness.

Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-252 (1985). The ex-wife contended that &sect; 8.01-252 was in violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, and the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife contended that &sect; 8.01-252 was unconstitutional because Va.

In Florida, the ex-wife obtained a judgment against the ex-husband in 1964 and later revived the judgment in 1977. In 1981 she sought to enforce the judgment in Florida. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which held that the ex-wife's action was barred. The court found that (1) revival of the judgment under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.100(d) did not give rise to a new judgment, but rather continued the old one, such that the date of rendition and the date the limitations period began to run was 1964; (2) Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-252 (1985) did not violate the Full Faith and Credit Clause because it was not so stringent and unreasonable as to deny a substantive right, and (3) &sect; 8.01-252 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it applied to a different class of people than Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-251, which applied to persons who had an immediate right to enforcement, and it satisfied the rational relationship test where there was a legitimate purpose that supported the classification.</SPAN></P>

The trustees denied the child's application for benefits, and the child filed his action for benefits. The trial court determined that the employee was the father of the child and entered judgment that the trustees owed death benefits with interest to the child. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the employee's acknowledgement of paternity and his treatment of the child as his own, was sufficient to carry the child's burden of proof. The mother's hearsay statements that the employee was the child's father were admissible under the pedigree exception because the mother was deceased or out of the state.

The court held that even assuming, without deciding, that the arresting officers failed to present defendant to the magistrate before an unreasonable period of time had elapsed, this violation did not result in exclusion of the confession obtained from defendant in the interim interrogation. The trial court decision finding that defendant's confession was not coerced but was made freely and voluntarily was supported by credible evidence. Given the gravity of the offense charged and the evidence of defendant's propensity for violent crime and escape, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that, in the interest of security, defendant should be restrained. Because the court could not say that the assistant commonwealth's attorney's remarks that the judge was the person who fixed the sentence had &quot;no effect&quot; on the jury's sentencing decision, the sentence of death had to be vacated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

While in custody, defendant was questioned with regard to the investigation. A consensual search of defendant's room in his mother's house revealed clothes that appeared to be stained with blood, semen, and feces. When defendant was confronted with the evidence, he confessed. Defendant was convicted. He appealed claiming error in the denial of his motions to suppress, to strike, and to set aside the verdict. The court affirmed the convictions. The arresting officer was operating under warrants that commanded him to seize defendant. Thus, had there been no murder investigation, defendant would still have been arrested. Therefore, his arrest was not a sham. Moreover, based on the warrants, there was probable cause to arrest defendant. Hence, the officers lawfully used the arrest as an opportunity to question him about the unrelated investigation. There was no claim that evidence was lost or that defendant was otherwise prejudiced as a result of the delay in taking him before a magistrate. Thus, his detention did not become unlawful due to the delay.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion and convicted defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and the denial of such motion. The court held that the seizure of defendant under the circumstances of the roadblock was reasonable under the U.S. Const. amends. IV, XIV and Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court held that the action of the police was not an impermissible infringement upon defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy because the state's strong interest in protecting the public from the grave risk presented by drunk drivers outweighed the minimal inconvenience caused to motorists approaching the roadblock.

The court determined that an officer had full authority to question defendant about his identity, regardless of the outcome of a pat-down. The court found that &sect; 17-13(c) did not violate or even implicate U.S. Const. amend.

Defendant appealed and the previous court remanded for reconsideration. The court affirmed and held that the trial court had an opportunity to observe defendant's appearance and demeanor. Nothing in the record suggested any bizarre behavior and defendant never attempted to introduce the mental test results. Thus, defendant failed to make the requisite Ake threshold demonstration. He did not demonstrate to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense would be a significant factor. Although Ake required the conclusion that the trial court erred in denying defendant an independent psychiatrist once the State had submitted psychiatric evidence on the issue of future dangerousness, the error did not invalidate the jury's finding of vileness.</SPAN></P>

Both juries fixed his punishment for the capital murders at death under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.2 and the trial court sentenced defendant in accordance with the jury verdicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate jury trials, defendant was convicted of two similar capital murders in the commission of robberies of convenience stores while armed with deadly weapons. The trial court sentenced defendant to death in accordance with the jury verdicts. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's motions to suppress statements were properly denied because he gave the statements, in which he admitted shooting one victim, voluntarily and intelligently. Defendant was not entitled to a private investigator at the public's expense. Though defendant did not take the cash drawer from a convenience store, he was properly convicted of capital murder in the commission of a robbery under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31 where he committed the murder and was an accomplice to the robbery. The court upheld the jury's imposition of death under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-264.2 after the first trial, based on evidence of the second murder, because the evidence of defendant's prior unadjudicated criminal conduct was properly used in the penalty phase to prove his propensity to commit criminal acts of violence in the future. The sentences of death were not disproportionate to the sentences imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The mother had filed a petition against the putative father in 1980 in the juvenile and domestic relations district court under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-61.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of her petition for the support of her daughter, the mother had presented the testimony of a laboratory supervisor who performed blood grouping tests, including HLA tests, on blood samples from the mother, child, and putative father. The mother also presented testimony of two experts in the field of genotypic blood testing. The mother's experts testified that HLA testing was accepted as reliable in the scientific and medical communities. The experts testified that there was a 99.95 percent probability that the putative father was the father of the mother's child. The sole issue on appeal was whether the trial court, as the trier of fact, arbitrarily disregarded the uncontradicted testimony of unimpeached witnesses. On appeal, the court held that there was testimony from experts that paternity was established beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the trial court arbitrarily disregarded the undisputed evidence which established the putative father's paternity. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for a determination of the proper amount of support to be paid by the putative father for the benefit of his child.</SPAN></P>

The putative fathers appealed claiming that &sect; 20.61.1 was the sole means of proving paternity of illegitimate children. The court agreed that the legislative intent of &sect; 20-61.1 suggested that it was intended to control in all paternity cases involving unwed parents; however, &sect; 20-616.1 as it read at the time of the mothers' lawsuits was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause; illegitimate children did not have the same judicially enforceable rights as legitimate children.

The death penalty was imposed on the murder count, and life imprisonment was imposed on the robbery count. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed and held that the capital murder statutes were constitutional and that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. Considering the disparity in age, size, and health, the brutality of the attack, the concealment of the victim's body, and defendant's efforts to divert suspicion from himself, the trial court was justified in disbelieving defendant's self-serving confession. The killing and the theft were part of a common criminal design, so the convictions were proper. The sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty in similar cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-35.1 changed the common law rule that the release of one joint tortfeasor was the release of all and allowed the settling tortfeasor to be discharged from contribution as well. The malpractice case arose prior to an amendment that applied the statute to covenants not to sue and releases executed before certain dates, regardless of the date the causes of action affected thereby accrued. The patient reached settlement with the physicians after the amendment. The hospital claimed it was released by the settlement with the physicians. On appeal, the court held that joint tortfeasors had substantive rights of contribution that arose at the time of the tort and that the retroactive application of a statute that deprived the tortfeasors of that right violated due process and was invalid. The court ruled that acceptance of a credit under protest did not estop the hospital from its appeal. The court also held that the common law rule was in effect at the time the rights of the parties became vested and that it would be improper for the court to retroactively repeal the rule under the guise of promoting equity.</SPAN></P>

Other subsections of &sect; 18.2-31 referred to the killing of &quot;any person,&quot; whereas &sect; 18.2-31(e) employed the term &quot;a person.&quot; In addition, &sect; 18.2-31(e) proscribed killing &quot;during the commission of, or subsequent to, rape,&quot; which established a narrower time frame than that created by the phrase &quot;in the commission of&quot; in other subsections. The use of the more restrictive language in &sect; 18.2-31(e) supported the contention that the person killed had to be the rape victim. Strictly construing the penal statute, the court held that &sect; 18.2-31(e) could not be extended to include the murder of someone other than the rape victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, the court determined that the Virginia capital murder statute was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Compliance officers of the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry sought to conduct a consensual safety inspection of the corporation's plant, but its employees refused to permit the inspection without a valid search warrant. The commissioner later obtained a warrant based on affidavits of two of her officers, but the compliance officers were refused the right to carry out the inspection on the ground that the warrant was illegal. The trial court found that the corporation was in civil contempt for interfering with the execution of the warrant and enjoined it from interfering with the inspection. The corporation argued that the trial court erred in upholding the constitutionality of the inspection warrant in that it was not based on probable cause. The commissioner argued that declaratory relief was inappropriate because the corporation failed to properly challenge the affidavits. The court held, inter alia, that affidavits in support of the commissioner's application for the warrant did not provide sufficient information to allow a finding that the inspection plan was reasonable or based on neutral criteria. Thus, the warrant violated the Fourth Amendment and could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad company conveyed a tract of land, reserving mineral rights in it. The landowner bought the land then filed suit to extinguish the mineral rights reservations. The railroad company filed a demurrer, contending that VA. Code &sect; 55-154 violated VA. Const. art. IV, &sect; 14(3), in that it was a &quot;local, special, or private law&quot; that changed the rules of evidence in a judicial proceeding. The trial court sustained the demurrer. The landowners appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the pattern of inclusion and exclusion in the operation of VA. Code &sect; 55-154, as it applied to lands west of the Blue Ridge did not apply to all counties similarly situated. The court saw no reasonable explanation pertinent to the purpose of the statute to explain the variations and determined no apparent rational relationship between gross population figures and the presence or accessibility of minerals, the value of mineral deposits, the density of habitation, or the condition of land titles in any given area. The court found that the statute, as it operated west of the Blue Ridge, was merely a circuitous and disingenuous means of designating and providing local legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation challenged the findings of guilt against it on constitutional grounds. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of guilt. The court held that Newport News City Code &sect; 27-4(2) was constitutionally applied in the instant case under the First Amendment and under Va. Const. Art. I, &sect; 12. The court also found that &sect; 27-4(2) did not place an affirmative duty on a landlord to determine the nature of materials disseminated by a tenant. Rather, the court determined that &sect; 27-4(2) merely imposed a criminal sanction on the landlord who purposefully allowed his property to be used for distribution of obscenity or, after becoming aware of such use, continued to permit the illegal activity. Lastly, the court reasoned that because the wording of &sect; 27-4(2) disclosed the legislative intent that each obscene motion picture would constitute the basis for a separate offense and because the evidence, the film, was different in each case, the trial court did not err in denying the corporation's motion to consolidate the 33 indictments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth filed a complaint against a bookstore, seeking to enjoin an alleged nuisance arising from illicit sexual activity on the premises. At a hearing on the commonwealth's motion for a temporary injunction, the trial court heard evidence that the bookstore was a place where homosexuals congregated to engage in sexual acts. The trial court ordered that the bookstore limit access to its four movie booths and hire guards to prevent use of a booth by more than one patron at a time. After a later hearing, the trial court found that the criminal sexual activity existed on the premises of the bookstore of such a continuous and pervasive nature to constitute a public nuisance, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 48-7, and that &sect; 48-12 was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case. The trial court ordered the bookstore to remove all movie booth partitions by a certain date. On appeal, the court reversed and held that closure of the bookstore was a proper exercise of the commonwealth's police power and did not constitute an impermissible infringement on First Amendment freedoms. The trial court was required to comply with the abatement provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 48-12.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder for the willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder of a victim during the commission of, or subsequent to, rape in violation of Va.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction and held that defendant's sentence of death was not excessive or disproportionate to those imposed in similar cases. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to change venue and refusing to sequester the jury since the trial court admonished the jury not to discuss the case with others or to expose themselves to media coverage. The court found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had sexual intercourse with the victim by force and against her will, as such the evidence was sufficient to prove capital murder. The court found sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of the vileness of the murder and defendant's future dangerousness was established by a previous murder conviction and escape from prison, as such the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city housing authority was to obtain money from the city to loan to a developer for the development of a hotel convention center in a redevelopment area of the city. The city passed a $ 9.5 million bond ordinance that declared that the proceeds from the sale of the bonds were to be transferred to the Authority for its use in carrying out its public purposes. Appellee brought an action for a declaratory judgment that the city's attempt to give money to the housing authority, which in turn would lend money to the developer, was an effort to lend, indirectly, the credit of the city to a private entity in violation of the &quot;credit clause&quot; of Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 10. The trial court ruled that the city's involvement in the project violated the credit clause. The court disagreed and reversed the judgment. The court found that the trial court did not properly apply the &quot;animating purpose test&quot;. Applying the test, the court found that the primary motivation for the city's efforts was to promote the purposes of the housing authority and that any benefit to the developer was merely incidental to the proper governmental function of the redevelopment of a &quot;blighted&quot; area.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed in part, holding that the hotel failed to exhaust an available administrative remedy adequate to achieve the relief sought in the court below and that the chancellor erred in adjudicating the statutory and constitutional issues. Additionally, the court affirmed the chancellor's ruling sustaining appellants' motion to strike the hotel's damage claim. Insofar as the chancellor ruled that the zoning restriction was invalid, the court reversed the decree and vacated the injunction, without prejudice to the hotel's right to pursue its application for a provisional use permit.</SPAN></P>

The court found each of the assertions meritless. It said that defendant's assertion that the common law rule still applied today was erroneous. It said that his estranged wife had a right to refuse sexual intercourse with him at the very least while they were separated. Additionally, the court said that it rejected the English common law rule regarding a husband's marital exemption from a charge of raping his wife and the implied consent to marital intercourse as provides that a wife cannot unilaterally revoke her implied consent to marital intercourse. The court went further to say that defendant's argument that the to revoke the marital exemption would have disrupted marriages was absurd. It said that a wife could have unilaterally revoked her implied consent to marital sex, where she made manifest her intent to terminate the marital relationship by living separate, and violations after that established a violation of Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clam harvesters leased clam planting grounds from the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, and were harvesting using hydraulic dredges pursuant to experimental permits. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 28.1-128.01 was later passed, prohibiting the use of the dredges out of concern about their effect on the environment and the clam supply. The clam harvesters sought declaratory judgment that the legislation was unconstitutional as applied to them, and the trial court enjoined the enforcement of the statute. On appeal, the court reversed the injunction, holding that although the leases were chattels real, and therefore subject to the law of personal property, the subsequent enaction of the statute did not amount to an unconstitutional taking of that property; rather, it was a valid exercise of police power. While the leases granted an exclusive right to take clams from the leased grounds, they did not grant a right to use a hydraulic dredge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a man for hire and later killed a man who had been &quot;running his mouth&quot; about the first killing.

The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a change of venue because there was no evidence that defendant was prejudiced by the jury selection. Defendant voluntarily made incriminating statements to an investigator. Evidence of the second murder was probative because it showed defendant's desire to conceal his guilt and also, during the penalty trial, established the probability that defendant would commit future crimes of violence. Graphic photographs were admissible to establish premeditation and malice. After-discovered evidence was cumulative and did not mandate a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect; 15.1-1132 (1980), the voters petitioned the city and county to perfect a consolidation agreement. After an agreement was not reached, the trial court ordered the appointment of the committees. The committees' duties and powers were defined and they were instructed to consider for inclusion in the consolidation agreement the provisions in Va. Code &sect; 15.1-1135. The council challenged the proceedings and argued that the appointment of a committee to act on its behalf was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The council alleged that the proposed agreement may have included taxation provisions, and thus, the statute violated Va. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5, which required that local governing bodies be elected by the qualified voters. The court affirmed the appointment on appeal. The committees were merely drafting a proposed agreement to be approved by the voters, not a tax ordinance. Thus, Va. Code &sect; 15.1-1132 was not facially unconstitutional. It was implicit in the procedure that the governing bodies were to pay the committees' expenses. The trial court did not err in directing the committees to operate as a single entity in preparing the agreement.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were indicted for grand larceny. The commonwealth prosecuted defendants for larceny by embezzlement pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-111. Following the jury's convictions, defendants claimed immunity and unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the prosecution pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-501. On appeal, the court affirmed.

Defendants waived the statutory immunity granted by &sect; 501 that they had earned by their civil testimony when they failed to invoke such immunity at the start of the criminal prosecution.

Defendant sought a new trial on a non-capital offense, a new trial on the capital charge, or commutation of his death sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court found that the trial court properly admitted defendant's confession during investigation because he voluntarily waived his rights and the police were permitted to ascertain whether defendant had changed his mind about wanting an attorney, which did not amount to police-initiated interrogation. The trial court properly admitted evidence seized in Japan because defendant's statement regarding the whereabouts of a ring, which was ruled inadmissible because it was made after defendant was denied the assistance of counsel in Japan, was not used to obtain the search warrant. The trial court did not err in denying discovery into statements made by the state's witnesses. The trial court properly admitted photographs of the victim, jewelry, and evidence of another robbery planned by defendant in the guilt phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners traced their claim to a grant from the King. On appeal, defendants urged that even if the royal governors as the King's agent intended to make a grant of the bed of Carter's Cove, which was adjacent to the landowners' property, no title to the bottom passed because the act was beyond the King's authority. The Commonwealth argued that the crown had no power to grant the bottoms of navigable waters to private individuals thus interfering with the public right of fishing or oystering. The Commonwealth argued that after royal power was limited by Magna Carta, the grants could be made only with the consent of Parliament, and there was no record of such parliamentary consent. The court disagreed and held that the King had the power, acting through the royal governors, to grant the bed of Carter's Cove to private persons. The court further noted that Va. Code &sect; 62.1-1 provided that all beds of the bays, rivers, and creeks within the territorial jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, not conveyed by special grant or compact according to law was the property of the Commonwealth. Thus, that statute acknowledged that private rights could have properly been acquired by lawful grants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol when he committed the offenses. On appeal, he alleged, inter alia, that the trial court erred in refusing to give the jury an instruction on second-degree murder. The court held that an instruction on second-degree murder should not be given unless it was supported by evidence. The trial court did give an instruction that if the jury found defendant so greatly intoxicated that he was incapable of deliberating or premeditating, he could not be found guilty of a capital offense. But under the evidence presented, it was unlikely that the jury could find that the element of contemporaneous robbery was so lacking as to reduce the crime to second-degree murder. The felony-murder statute,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-32, applied where a killing was so closely related to a robbery in time, place, and causal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal offense. The court held that the evidence was clear that the robbery and murder were part of the same criminal enterprise. Also, refusal of the instruction was harmless error because the verdict made it clear that the jury rejected the defense of voluntary intoxication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 29-144.2 and the admissibility of certain evidence. The statute contained a presumption that any person was guilty of a violation who at night in possession of a specified type of weapon flashed a light from a vehicle without good cause. The statute provided a second presumption that every person in or on such vehicle was a principal in the second degree. A game warden had observed a deer in the woods and a car pointing its headlights at the deer and moving very slowly. Defendants were found in the car with a rifle. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the statute was constitutional because the presumptions were rebuttable and were to be analyzed as permissive inferences, even if the first presumption was construed to require defendants to produce some evidence of &quot;good cause.&quot; The presumptions were not unconstitutionally applied because there was a rational connection between the proved facts and the presumed ultimate fact, and the presumed fact was more likely than not to follow.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state comptroller notified the attorney general of doubts he had respecting the constitutionality, proper construction, and interpretation of the Act. The doubts related to the authority of the Virginia Public Building Authority to undertake financial obligations to construct, improve, furnish, maintain, acquire, and operate public buildings for sale, lease, or conveyance to the Commonwealth of Virginia. The attorney general filed the instant writ of mandamus to seek adjudication as to the constitutionality of the Act and to compel the state comptroller to issue funds for the building authority's project. The court held that the revenue bonds proposed to be issued by the building authority were not state debts in violation of Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 9 because the full faith and credit of the commonwealth was not pledged or committed to pay said bonds. The court also held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.1-234.13, requiring prior authorization by the general assembly of any project undertaken by the building authority, did not contravene the separation of powers as required by Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 5, and Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stores operated local convenience stores. There was a local ordinance that distinguished &quot;quick-service food stores&quot; from other grocery stores and similar retail uses. The court held that although the stores had never been denied a special exception to the ordinance, the stores' claim was not just seeking an advisory opinion and the stores had a &quot;justiciable interest&quot; so as to confer declaratory judgment jurisdiction upon the court pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-184. In holding that the court had subject matter jurisdiction, the court held that the declaratory judgment statutes were remedial and were to be liberally interpreted. The court held that the stores had presented sufficient evidence to overcome the Board's initial presumption of legislative validity, but that if evidence of reasonableness was sufficient to make the question &quot;fairly debatable,&quot; the ordinance had to be sustained. The court found that the Board's evidence did show that the question whether quick-service food stores should be required to obtain a special exception was &quot;fairly debatable.&quot; Therefore, the ordinance was sustained and the motion for declaratory judgment was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners and the conservancy disputed their rights and privileges to a barrier island. Resolution of the dispute, involved tracing the commonwealth's land-grant statutes back to the 1700s. The trial court held that the conservancy had no title to the marshes or beaches granted by the commonwealth after 1780. On appeal, the court affirmed as to the marshes and the beaches granted after 1780, holding that these lands were also held as a common. The court also affirmed as to the conservancy's title to beaches granted by the commonwealth before 1780, subject to the public's right to fish, hunt, and fowl. But the court reversed as to the beach-access road, holding that the landowners had no right to use the roads or beach as a public or private way.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A businesswoman operated an answering service from her home with the assistance of two employees who did not reside there in violation of a city ordinance prohibiting businesses with outside employees in residential districts. The city argued that the ordinance was a legitimate exercise of its police power to promote healthy residential areas. The court held that the ordinance was substantially related to the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare, was reasonably suited to the protection of harmonious residential areas, and did not arbitrarily discriminate. The city had legitimately exercised its discretion to strike a balance between competing interests and the businesswoman had not carried her burden of proving that she was the object of discrimination by showing she was treated differently from others similarly situated. She was not entitled to relief if a nearby business had also violated the ordinance because the law would not hold that two wrongs made a right. The city's evidence was sufficient to make the question of the ordinance's reasonableness at least fairly debatable and therefore the presumption of reasonableness was not overcome.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that pursuant to &sect; 18.2-258.1(A)(iv), the commonwealth was not required to show a causal connection between defendant's use of the false name and his acquisition of the prescription drug. Reading &sect; 18.2-258.1(A)(iv) in conjunction with the Drug Control Act, Va.

Defendant, who had been released from prison the day before the murder, knew the victim and knew money was in the apartment.

Items missing from the victim's ransacked apartment were found in defendant's car. The trial court convicted him of capital murder in commission of a robbery while armed with a deadly weapon. The court affirmed. Defendant was not prejudiced by the decision not to postpone the trial because he had ample time and a court-appointed investigator to search for alibi evidence. The hammer was a deadly weapon within the meaning of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-31(d). Defendant's absence from the courtroom in the final minutes of the trial was the result of his inappropriate behavior, and he thereby forfeited his rights to confrontation and to be present at the trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium association filed a bill to enforce liens against defendant unit owners for unpaid fines and for an injunction. In a separate suit the unit owners sought a declaratory judgment of their rights under the association's bylaws, injunctive relief, and damages. The Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia) held that the fines were unlawful and granted the association injunctive relief and counsel fees. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unit owners operated a fleet of trash-collecting trucks. The condominium association fined the unit owners because the trucks emitted noxious odors and amended its bylaws to make it effectively impossible for the unit owners to operate their business. The association claimed it had the power to levy fines because the Condominium Act (Act), Va. Code Ann. &sect; 55-79.39 et seq., did not limit the powers that could be granted by the condominium documents. The unit owners claimed the trial court failed to construe the bylaws, rules, and regulations of the association as applied to them and that the injunction was vague. The court held that the Act did not grant the condominium association the power to impose fines to secure compliance with its bylaws, rules, and regulations. The court held that amendments should be measured by a reasonableness standard, based upon their relationship to the condominium's purposes and whether the condominium association acted within the scope of its authority under the Act, master deed, and bylaws. The court held that the injunction lacked reasonable standards and was not supported by findings that the unit owners trucks created the alleged conditions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board adopted special standards requiring the utilities to reduce levels of nutrients in the effluent from sewage treatment plants to a level too low to be attainable by any known technology or, in the alternative, to route its effluent through an alternative disposal system, in order to reduce the growth of algae in the receiving waters. The utilities appealed to the circuit court, which found that the actions of the Board were confiscatory and void. The court affirmed, holding that although it did not agree that the Board's actions were confiscatory, the error was harmless. The court rejected the Board's argument that its standard was reasonable because the effluent could be routed through the alternative system. Under its enabling legislation, the Board was required to adopt water quality standards that were practical and based on a fair weighing of the costs and benefits. Here, requiring the utilities to achieve a level of purity that exceeded that of rain water or be forced to use the alternative system was arbitrary.

Two of the children were reported to be in &quot;very bad&quot; physical condition. The state agency worked with the mother to improve her condition so that the children could be returned to her, but the mother failed to obtain suitable housing and steady employment. The mother and her husband divorced upon the husband's release from prison. The husband voluntarily terminated his parental rights, but the mother refused to do so and failed to improve her condition. The state agency filed an action to terminate the mother's parental rights and prevailed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the ruling was supported by clear and convincing evidence that the factors specified in Va. Code &sect; 16.1-283(C)(2) were present because the mother failed to remedy adverse conditions identified by the state agency. Once the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that factors specified in Va. Code &sect; 16.1-283 were present, the trial court was not required to make a further finding of parental unfitness in order to terminate residual parental rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the objections of the city. In affirming, the court held that the attempt by the citizens to set the tax rate of the city by initiative was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Va. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 2, 7, when read together, limited the power of the General Assembly in establishing municipal corporations.

Affirming defendant's convictions, the court held that &sect; 19.2-294 only applied where two or more statutory offenses were involved. The unlawful wounding offense was statutory but voluntary manslaughter was a common law offense. The convictions did not violate constitutional double jeopardy provisions because, viewed in the abstract, the offenses required different proofs of fact and qualified as separate offenses under the Blockburger test.

The accused was remanded to jail after being charged with assault, an offense committed while he was free on bond. The accused was convicted of assault, and a district court judge forfeited the bond. The surety appealed to the circuit court, contending that because the accused had been remanded to jail, &sect; 19.2-135 (as amended 1979) did not permit the district court to forfeit the bond. In response, the Commonwealth argued that the classification created by the 1979 amendment discriminated against those posting cash bonds in violation of the equal protection clause. On appeal, the court held that the Commonwealth had no standing to assert the constitutional rights of the third parties because the Commonwealth's interest in revenue from forfeited non-cash bonds was not mutually interdependent with the equal protection or the &quot;special laws&quot; rights of those posting cash bonds.</SPAN></P>

Prior to sentencing, defendant submitted a list of questions to be asked of prospective jurors upon voir dire.

The trial court refused to submit this question for voir dire, and defendant was sentenced to death. He appealed, and the court affirmed his conviction, reversed the death sentence, and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. The trial court erred when it refused defendant's question because it prevented the seating of an impartial jury. The process of selection of impartial jury permitted elimination for cause of those veniremen who were biased in favor of the death penalty as well as those who were biased against it. However, the unconstitutional imposition of punishment did not render the guilty verdict also unconstitutional. The court undertook an independent review of the evidence and found it sufficient to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court determined two questions: Whether the employer in the hearing below effectively rebutted the presumption contained in &sect; 65.1-47.1 and whether the presumption violated the due process clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions. The court affirmed the award of workmen's compensation, holding that because the employer had offered no evidence of a non-work-related cause of the disability, he did not meet his burden of proof to overcome the statutory presumption. The court rejected the employer's contention that the presumption created by &sect; 65.1-47.1 denied the employer due process of law. The court held that the legislature's conclusion that a firefighter who contracted a respiratory disease after he had started work suffered from an occupational disease was a reasonable. The employer argued that the presumption was essentially irrebutable because the etiology of pulmonary sarcoidosis was unknown. The court held that, as long as the employer was permitted to introduce evidence in rebuttal of the presumption, the employer's constitutional rights of due process were protected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, newspapers challenged the trial courts' decisions overruling their objections to the entry of orders closing pretrial suppression hearings pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-266 in three criminal prosecutions. The court reversed and vacated the trial courts' orders. The court held that all three judges erred in ordering closure without affording the newspapers a hearing on the merits, because absent a hearing, there could be no record of the necessary findings to support closure. The court held that, absent &quot;an overriding interest articulated in findings,&quot; such hearings should be open to the public. The court stated that motions to close a hearing should be made in writing and filed with the trial court before the day of the hearing, and the public should be given reasonable notice. The court concluded that unless the standard for closure was established in accordance with the procedures outlined by the court, the closure of a pretrial hearing pursuant to the authority of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-266 would be violative of Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 and U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that Va.

Over defense counsel's objections, the trial judge ruled that he alone would ask the questions of prospective jurors during voir dire. The trial judge also concluded that he would question jurors in groups of five, except when questioning jurors about their views on the death penalty. Defendant contended that Va.

The commonwealth replied that trial courts had discretion in determining whether to permit counsel-conducted voir dire. The court affirmed the conviction and held that while defendant had a constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, he had no constitutional right to counsel-conducted voir dire. Thus, the court concluded that the trial court's refusal to question jurors individually out of the presence of other prospective jurors and refusal to allow counsel-conducted voir dire did not represent an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had sought a change of venue based on a claim of pretrial publicity and this motion was denied. Defendant claimed as well that the trial court had improperly refused to let him bring up the numerous other charges pending against the state's witness which would have shown that his testimony was given in exchange for not getting the death penalty. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions holding that the sheer volume of the media coverage involving defendant's many crimes had not warranted a change of venue. The court held further that defense counsel had been merely warned about the consequences of questioning the witness about other crimes. Finally, as to the question of whether the trial court had erred in refusing to give a requested instruction allowing the jury to determine that the robbery had ended at a point before the murder, the court held that refusal to grant the instruction had been proper because defense counsel had not been precluded from arguing that the robbery had ended before the murder took place and that lesser-included-offense instructions were proper but only when supported by evidence.</SPAN></P>
