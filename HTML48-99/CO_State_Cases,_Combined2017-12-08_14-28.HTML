<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant city appealed from the District Court, City and County of Denver's (Colorado) decision striking down the manager of revenue's assessment against plaintiff corporation of Denver's municipal use tax, Denver, Colo. Rev. Munic. Code &sect; 53-96(1) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff corporation brought vehicles to its Denver lab each year, where engineers ran the vehicles through high altitude emissions testing, both in the lab and the surrounding mountains, before shipping them to other testing centers. On average, the vehicles spent two to four percent of their useful lives in Denver. Defendant audited plaintiff, and imposed a use tax, pursuant to Denver, Colo. Rev. Munic. Code &sect; 53-96(1) (1993). Plaintiff contested the assessment. However, the hearing officer affirmed. On judicial review, the district court struck down the assessment. On appeal, the court reversed in part, concluding that the use tax did not offend the dormant Commerce Clause because it met the following four requirements: (1) it applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with Colorado; (2) it was fairly apportioned; (3) it did not discriminate against interstate commerce; and (4) it was fairly related to the services provided by Colorado.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court's ruling concerning the constitutionality of Denver's use tax assessment reversed. The tax properly applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with Colorado, and was externally consistent because it was apportioned to account for the fact that plaintiff's vehicles spent only part of their useful lives in Denver.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the initiative contained more than one subject in violation Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5.5). The court determined that the provision which altered the Commission on Judicial Discipline's powers constituted a subject distinct from that of regulating the judiciary. Additionally, the titles did not clearly and correctly express the initiative's subject. While the title and submission clause's language was virtually verbatim of the initiative's language, the court concluded that it did not fairly and accurately set forth the initiative's major tenets and was unclear with respect to the procedure for judicial removal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court issued a rule to show cause pursuant to Colo. App. R. 21 to determine whether respondent State, after filing criminal charges against petitioner, properly issue a subpoena duces tecum to compel production of petitioner's bank and telephone records without first obtaining a search warrant supported by probable cause. The court held that a subpoena duces tecum for such records was not an unreasonable search and seizure under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, provided it was supported by probable cause and properly defined and executed. The court noted a reasonable privacy expectation in bank and telephone records and invoked constitutional protections requiring probable cause for the search or seizure of such protected materials. The legal document compelling access need not be a warrant, but may be a subpoena duces tecum; however, petitioner was permitted to challenge the demand on grounds of lack of probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court made the rule absolute in part and discharged it in part, directing the trial court to make the determination whether probable cause for the subpoena existed.

On appeal, the prosecution argued that defendant did not have standing to make a facial challenge to the wiretapping statute and that the statute was neither overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague. The court held that a statute was facially overbroad if, in addition to proscribing conduct that was not constitutionally protected, its proscriptions swept in a substantial amount of activity that was constitutionally protected. As such, the court found that in light of the state's power to place some restrictions on parental control, the potential infringement on familial privacy was not real and substantial judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate proscriptions on wiretapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which dismissed the charges against defendant for wiretapping prohibited, because the wiretapping statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad as infringing on fundamental or express rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant state government sought reversal of the ruling of the District Court, Boulder County (Colorado) dismissing a wiretapping charge against appellee on the grounds that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-303(1)(e) (1997) imposed greater punishment for interference with corded telephones than for cordless was facially overbroad and violative of appellee's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee was arrested and charged with violating the state wiretapping statute due to his having interfered with his girlfriend's attempted telephone call to the police by disabling the telephone. The trial court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-303(1)(e) (1997), which criminalized interference with cordless and corded telephones differently, was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violative of equal protection. On appeal, the ruling was reversed and the wiretapping charge reinstated. The court reasoned that, with respect to the equal protection challenge, the statutory distinction between interferences with corded and cordless telephones was rational inasmuch as the two types of telephones transmit via different mediums (i.e., telephone lines for corded telephones, radio waves for cordless), with corded telephones entitled to greater protection since their users have a greater expectation of privacy. Consequently, the statute was not facially overbroad since there was a rational basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court's order dismissing a wiretapping charge was reversed because the legislature had a rational basis for distinguishing between corded and cordless telephones since those using corded telephones have a greater expectation of privacy in their calls, and thus, statutory provision calling for greater punishment for interfering with corded telephone calls was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Among the errors alleged, defendant challenged application of the killing to prevent arrest aggravator. The court held that this challenge failed because the prosecution presented evidence sufficient to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant killed his victims because they were potential witnesses whose identification of defendant could lead to his arrest. Additionally, the court concluded that the fact that defendant may have had motives for the murders in addition to avoiding arrest did not prevent application of this aggravator.

The provision reduced the permanent total disability payments otherwise payable to an injured worker who had reached the age of 65 and to whom social security or employer-paid retirement benefits were also payable. Petitioners argued that the provision violated the equal protection clause because it did not apply to injured workers who had reached their 65th birthday and were eligible to receive temporary or partial permanent workers' compensation payments, nor did it apply to permanently and totally disabled workers who incurred their injuries prior to reaching the age of 45. The court of appeals determined that the offset provision was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed.

The court held that (1) the statute extended reciprocal discovery only to those witnesses whom the defendant intended to call at trial and not to all prospective witnesses, and extended only to statements that related to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness; (2) that the reciprocal discovery required by &sect; 16-11-103(3.5)(c) comprised only substantial recitations of witness statements, and not the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of the defense; and (3) the constitutional issues raised by the defendant were without merit. The statute did not abrogate the work product doctrine, and by endorsing a witness, the defense was deemed to waive work product protection for statements by the witness.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner realtors appealed an intermediate appellate panel's judgment upholding a verdict favoring respondent landowners in respondents' trespass, misrepresentation, unlawful taking, and deceptive trade practices lawsuit. The court affirmed. Respondents sued petitioners after learning that petitioners, in the course of selling real property in a subdivision, misrepresented to actual and prospective purchasers that they had the right to use a road running through respondents' property. Respondents initiated suit, included in which was a claim brought under the state consumer protection law. That portion of the litigation resulted in the awarding of treble damages to respondents. In upholding the applicability of that law, the court held that respondents had standing, inasmuch as they were injured by petitioners' acts in violation of that law. The mere fact that respondents were not the target consumers did not mean, under the statute's language, that they were not protected by it. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner, the Colorado Department of Personnel (Department), challenged the judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals which reversed the trial court and concluded that the Department's failure to obtain gubernatorial approval before implementing pay decreases constituted an abuse of discretion. Respondent state employees had challenged the salary decreases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court of appeals determined that a study conducted by the Department was a reorganization with a fiscal impact requiring approval of the Governor under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-50-104(4)(d)(II) (1988 &amp; 1993 Supp.). The Department contended that implementation of the statewide job evaluation system study did not constitute a reorganization as contemplated by the legislature in &sect; 24-50-104(4)(d)(II). The Department also argued that the study did not cause an overall increase in costs due to offsetting increases and decreases, and therefore did not require gubernatorial approval. The court concluded that the fiscal impact of the reorganization under &sect; 24-50-104(4)(d)(II) included increases and decreases in salaries. The court held that (1) the implementation of the statewide job evaluation system study constituted a reorganization governed by &sect; 24-50-104(4)(d)(II) requiring the Governor's approval, and that (2) the requisite gubernatorial approval occurred when the Governor submitted the annual salary and fringe benefit survey.

The secretary conducted another review and found that the petition in fact contained enough signatures to conduct a line-by-line count. The secretary offered to place the initiative on the ballot while she conducted a line-by-line count. The trial court rejected her offer and ordered her to certify the initiative for the ballot. The secretary appealed.

The court reasoned that allowing certification without a valid number of the signatures would have violated the mandated signature requirement under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(2).

The court entered judgment on behalf of the sheriff and awarded attorney fees and costs under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Sheriff Training Statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-10-501.5 (1996 Supp.), promulgated training and certification requirements for county sheriffs. The sheriff failed the certification exam and the commissioners voted to suspend his salary and benefits. The sheriff filed an action under the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1979), challenging the county's application of the statute to withhold his salary. The trial court issued a permanent injunction. While the suit was pending, the general assembly repealed and reenacted a similar version of the statute. The trial court held that the reenacted statute was also unenforceable. The trial court issued an order prohibiting the state from suspending the sheriff's salary. The state defendants appealed and the court affirmed the trial court's orders. The court found that when the general assembly enacted the original Sheriff Training Statute, it lacked the authority to impose any qualifications on the constitutionally created office of county sheriff. The court held that the training and certification requirements contained in the reenacted statute could not be applied to the sheriff during his current term of office.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court held that the policy did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, the student appealed to the Colorado Court of Appeals and both parties then sought expedited certiorari review pursuant to Colo. App. R. 50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The student, who was enrolled in for-credit band classes and participated in the marching band, refused to consent to the district's mandatory drug testing of all students in extracurricular activities. The district suspended the student from the classes and the band. The student alleged that the district's policy violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court held that, under the facts of the case, the policy was unreasonable and unconstitutional with respect to the marching band. The drug testing constituted a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and even though the student had graduated from high school, the case was not moot because other students still had to submit to the testing. The trial court did not err in finding that the district had a serious drug problem, but its findings that drug use was the same across all extracurricular activities and that the student body in general had diminished expectations of privacy due to participation in physical education were clearly erroneous. The marching band members had a higher expectation of privacy than the athletes had, and there was no evidence of any drug-related injuries.</SPAN></P>

The Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado) struck down the municipal tax as an unconstitutional ad valorem tax. The city appealed from the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The construction company argued that the city's use tax was actually an ad valorem tax and was unconstitutional. Under Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 6, only the general assembly could enact ad valorem tax on self-propelled construction equipment. However, a municipal excise tax on such equipment was not a prohibited ad valorem tax. The court held that an excise tax differed from an ad valorem tax in that it was imposed on the performance of an act, the engaging in an occupation or the enjoyment of a privilege. An ad valorem tax was imposed on the basis of the value of the article or thing taxed. To determine whether the city's use tax was an excise or ad valorem tax, the court looked to the purpose, wording, and effect of the tax in light of its language and analogous taxes. The court also took into account other indicia, including the method prescribed for assessing the tax. The city's use tax was levied on a use privilege and was not invariably computed on the valuation of property and assessed by assessors. The city's tax auditor computed the amount owed based on the item's retail purchase price. In sum, the city's tax was a use or privilege and was an excise tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the ruling of the district court and held that the municipal tax levied on the construction equipment was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At sentencing on convictions for aggravated robbery and violence, the inmate was adjudged to be an habitual offender under the Act, &sect; 16-13-101(2), because he had three times previously been convicted of felonies. In his petition, the inmate argued that the Act, &sect; 16-13-101(2), constituted an unconstitutional bill of attainder. The court ruled that the district court properly denied his petition. Based upon a prior decision, the court found that the Act, &sect; 16-13-101(2), did not create a new offense. Rather, it merely made the punishment for a specific crime more severe because of an offender's prior criminal convictions. Because the Act, &sect; 16-13-101(2), only applied after the offender was convicted following a criminal trial or a plea of guilty, the court ruled that it was not a bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment and first held that, because the prisoner's appeal was still pending, he should have brought his argument on direct appeal or in a motion for postconviction relief. However, the court then determined that the habitual criminal statutes did not violate the Bills of Attainder Clause because the habitual criminal statute did not impose punishment without a trial. The statutes created no new offense, but only came into play after the prisoner was convicted of the drug charge following a trial. Only then was his sentence enhanced following a determination that he had previously been convicted of three other felonies.</SPAN></P>

Inside the envelope a plastic bag containing cigarettes and matches was found. The People charged the defendant with introducing contraband into the detention facility. On appeal, the court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-204(2)(l) was constitutional on its face as it provided sufficient statutory standards and safeguards to withstand a challenge based on the nondelegation doctrine. However, the court held that the detention facility failed to comply with the notice requirements of &sect; 18-8-204(2)(l) .The statute required the administrative head of a detention facility to provide &quot;reasonable notice&quot; of those items determined to be contraband under &sect; 18-8-204(2)(l). The &quot;reasonable notice&quot; provision of &sect; 18-8-204(2)(l) could not be satisfied simply by notice that an item was prohibited because an item could be prohibited without being designated as contraband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent carrier claimed that petitioners, state, department, and officials, violated state and federal law when they backbilled carriers for higher registration fees. The appellate court reversed the dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies of respondent's complaint. The court reversed and affirmed the dismissal of respondent's claims. The court held that respondent was required to exhaust its administrative remedies because the issues presented required factual determinations by petitioners and respondent had no reason to believe that an administrative proceeding would be futile. Petitioner, as a named plaintiff, was not exempt from the exhaustion requirement by the class action exception. Because respondent's claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 involved a challenge to a state tax, it was barred by the doctrine of comity. Petitioners could not recover attorney fees as the prevailing party under Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-17-201 because that statute conflicted with the provisions of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and was preempted.

The well company claimed the water based on deeds purporting to reserve the ownership of nontributary ground water underlying a subdivision when appellee development company conveyed lots to appellee homeowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court first analyzed the well company's theory of ownership to the aquifer water. Because it was clearly contrary to state water law, the court rejected it. The development company when it owned the land had an inchoate statutory right to extract and use Denver Basin aquifer water. It did not own a portion of the state's water resource by virtue of being a landowner. In order to establish a right in the Arapahoe aquifer, the development company had to perfect its use right in compliance with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-90-137(4). The court held that the state engineer and the water court acted within their authorities in determining that the Arapahoe aquifer water under the subdivision was not nontributary. The deeds did not withhold from the homeowners their inchoate right to use the not nontributary water under their lots. The court found that the homeowners had not consented to the water company's application. Accordingly, the water court correctly dismissed the application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was sitting in a parked car with another person when the police officer approached the vehicle and asked them what they were doing.

Defendant had an outstanding felony warrant for his arrest. After his arrest, cigarette rolling papers and a cigarette packet containing marijuana were found on defendant. Defendant was charged with introducing contraband in the first degree. On review, the court examined the totality of the circumstances involving the officer's stop of defendant and held that he was not subjected to a Fourth Amendment seizure. The court stated that the trial court erred in adopting a per se rule that an officer approaching a parked vehicle and asking its occupants for identification was an illegal stop because it was contrary to the traditional contextual approach.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The elector challenged the board's titles and summary determination on grounds that (1) the board lacked the jurisdiction to set the titles and summary for any proposal between the third Wednesday in May and the first Wednesday in December in any year and, therefore, was without jurisdiction to set the titles and summary on July 16, 1997, or to amend the titles and summary on August 6, 1997; (2) the titles and summary were misleading, failed to express correctly and fairly the true intent and meaning of the proposal, and created prejudice through the use of a prohibited &quot;catch phrase;&quot; and (3) the fiscal impact summary was insufficient. The court affirmed the board's action in part, and remanded the case to the board with directions. In so ruling, the court held that the statute did not prohibit the board from meeting during the summer months and, therefore, the board possessed jurisdiction to set the titles and summary for the initiative in July and August 1997.

The State had sought in the district court to refuse consent, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-101 (1997), to a defendant's jury trial waiver. The court issued a rule to show cause why the district court's order requiring a bench trial should not be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The district court granted a defendant's request for a bench trial on a charge of possession of a weapon by a previous offender under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-108 (1997), on the ground that requiring him to proceed before a jury would violate his right to due process. The court noted that a defendant's right to waive a jury trial was not guaranteed by the state constitution, but was a common law right subject to regulation or abrogation by the legislature, so that the State's refusal to consent to a request to waive a jury trial did not, in itself, implicate constitutional concerns. The court was unable to find that in enacting &sect; 18-12-108, the legislature created an offense that automatically required removal of a case from a jury whenever the underlying conviction was a prior &sect; 18-12-108 or other violent offense, because the possibility of collateral prejudice was not enough to render the jury trial unconstitutional. The court held that, in a trial solely involving a &sect; 18-12-108 violation, the fact that the jury would hear evidence of a prior &sect; 18-12-108 offense or other prior conviction involving a violent offense did not render the jury trial unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the citizens' use of the initiative process to demand passage of a constitutional amendment clearly violated the strict language of U.S. Const. art. V. because it attempted to usurp the elected representatives' exclusive authority to amend the Constitution using explicit mandates and coercion. By dictating to elected representatives the precise manner in which they were to attempt to amend the Constitution, Amendment 12 was contrary to the principle of representative government, which also violated the Guarantee Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4. Further, the court found that the amendment's ballot designations were negative and instructional and, in apprising voters of particular candidates who had disregarded or declined to follow the people's will, also abrogated the representative form of government.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that while the Colorado Public Utilities Commission had broad power to regulate public utilities, that power was delimited by the city's general police power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.

The defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the remaining charge of first-degree murder entitling him to a trial within six months under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405(1) (1986).

The taxpayers brought suit against the board of county commissioners and the county treasurer, claiming that the county's retention of the redemption interest was an unconstitutional taking and an unjust enrichment. The trial court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and the appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed the judgment below, but on different grounds. Specifically, the court held that because the taxpayers had no reasonable expectation based on state law of being exempt from payment of redemption interest as a penalty, no taking occurred when the county charged such a penalty as required by statute. Furthermore, the court ruled that the county was not unjustly enriched by the taxpayers' payment of this penalty because the taxpayers conveyed no benefit to the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The injured worker contended that she was separated from employment because the employer did not offer her re-employment within her work restrictions. An administrative law judge ordered that her temporary total disability (TTD) benefits be offset by the amount of unemployment (UI) benefits she received. An ALJ later determined that she was not entitled to restoration of the amount the employer claimed as an offset. In the current case, &sect; 8-42-103(1)(f) did not affect a suspect or a special class, and the receipt of workers' compensation benefits was not a fundamental right. The court therefore reviewed the statutory provision under the rational basis standard. The court found that the persons affected by the offset provision's classifications were similarly situated. The scheme was rationally related to the legitimate government interest in preventing double recovery because the offset requirement only applied to persons who received both TTD and UI benefits for the same period of time.</SPAN></P>

The jury convicted defendant on both counts. The jury heard no evidence concerning materiality, and was not instructed that a false statement must have been material in order to constitute perjury. Based on a United State Supreme Court decision that was announced before his sentencing, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court granted the motion, and the prosecution filed an interlocutory appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the failure to submit the element of materiality to the jury for determination was a structural defect. Thus, it did not constitute harmless error. The fact that the statutory definition of &quot;materially false statement&quot; provided that materiality was a question of law did not establish that materiality was not an element of the crime of first-degree perjury. The plain language of the first-degree perjury statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-502, required that a false statement was material. As such, materiality had to have been proven by the prosecution to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The director was granted certiorari to review the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation's lottery license revocation was based solely on the fact that a manager of the corporation had been convicted on a felony sexual offense, thus lacking the requisite character to continue as a lottery sales agent. The director made the determination after an evidentiary hearing even though the ALJ determined that the felony conviction bore no relation to the lottery. On review, the trial court upheld the revocation, and the lower court reversed, finding that the manager was a person of good character. The court found that the revocation order was arbitrary and capricious because the license revocation was not in accord with the applicable law. The court held that the applicable character standard for a license revocation was set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-35-206(2)(a) (IV) pertaining to character consistent with trust in the lottery, not the character provision for obtaining a license which was used by the director. The court found that the director's determination based solely on the felony conviction was arbitrary where Colo. Rev.

The employee failed to show a special relationship between herself and the employers, because the only special relationship that qualified as an exception under &sect; 1983 was a relationship that rendered a party without the ability to provide for basic needs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, holders of gaming licenses, appealed a decision from the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which dismissed their complaint against the state in which they alleged that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47.1-804(1) (1996) violated the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Colorado. They argued that &sect; 12-47.1-804(1) impermissibly abridged a candidate's right of access to the ballot and to hold office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two holders had been mayors and had to resign in order to obtain gaming licenses. The other holder alleged that he was interested in seeking office someday and also that he was unable to vote for the candidates of his choice because those candidates held gaming licenses and were thus not eligible to run for office. The court held that &sect; 12-47.1-804(1) did not operate to deny candidates an interest in a license, did not require public officials to resign, and did not fence out an independently identifiable class of candidates. Section 12-47.1-804(1) imposed only a limited burden on the right to run for and hold public office. The court further held that the holders only had standing to challenge &sect; 12-47.1-804(1) on vagueness grounds if it was vague as applied to them. The court concluded that the holders' right of access to the ballot, or to office, nor a voters' right of choice of candidates was impermissibly burdened by &sect; 12-47.1-804(1). The state had a legitimate basis for the imposition of restrictions on those rights in order to preserve both propriety and the appearance of propriety in local government and the gambling industry.</SPAN></P>

The trial court further concluded that attorneys' right to attorney fees had not vested prior to entry of a judgment awarding compensation. On review, the court held that the Colorado Constitution prohibited application of &sect; 13-17-203 to the present facts in that the attorneys' right to compensation from the common fund was a substantive right; and because the attorneys' right to a fee award from the common fund vested before the enactment of &sect; 13-17-203, in that the attorney's equitable right to compensation vested at the time the fund was created.</SPAN></P>

The citizens challenged SCR 95-2 as violative of the single-subject requirement of Colo. Const. art. XIX, &sect; 2(3). The district court dismissed the petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The three defendants were a family-owned fuel distributor, one of its two shareholders, and the husband of the second shareholder. They were accused of not paying fuel taxes. The three search warrants authorized searches for all books and records in the name of defendants as well as in the name of the second shareholder. The court reversed the trial court's decision. It held that that while the warrants at issue were essentially &quot;all records&quot; warrants, these warrants did not in themselves violate the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment; rather, the court stated, such warrants were appropriate where, as here, there was probable cause to believe that the crime alleged encompassed the entire business operation and that evidence would be found in most or all business documents. Here, it added, the government was unable to conduct an on-site audit, there was no evidence that the searches were exploratory, and the state showed good faith in obtaining the third warrant before seizing computer equipment and printouts. Thus, it concluded, the warrants were supported by probable cause and were not overbroad or defective.</SPAN></P>

It remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner, the Board of Education of the Adams County-Westminster School District (board), sought review of the decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals, which reversed the decision of the board to dismiss respondent, a non-probationary teacher (teacher) pursuant to the Teacher Employment, Compensation, and Dismissal Act of 1990, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-63-101 to -403 (1995). The Supreme Court of Colorado granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A school superintendent filed charges against the teacher, recommending dismissal. A hearing officer entered findings of fact establishing insubordination and neglect of duty as grounds for dismissal, but recommended retention of the teacher. On review, the board ordered dismissal of the teacher for insubordination and neglect of duty. The teacher sought review. The court of appeals undertook review of the board's order under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-63-302(10)(c) (1995), found that the hearing officer's recommendation rather than the board's decision had more support in the record. Thus, the court of appeals reversed the board's order and ordered reinstatement. On review, the court affirmed the court of appeals' determination that the record consisted in this case of the hearing officer's findings because neither party challenged these findings. However, the court found that &sect;22-63-302(10)(c) required the court of appeals to determine in all cases governed by that statute whether the board's conduct in ordering dismissal of a teacher was arbitrary, capricious, or legally impermissible. Thus, the court reversed and remand to the court of appeals for review under that standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff failed to comply with an order to correct blight factors on his property. Defendant county razed the fire damaged building, as set forth in the order. Defendant individuals intentionally and deliberately directed the destruction of other buildings on the property. The court held that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 allowed a municipality to be sued directly if the alleged unconstitutional action implemented or executed a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision. The court held that individual defendants were not policy makers for defendant county and that it was not liable for their actions. The court held that individual defendants were liable under &sect; 1983. The court held that individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because their actions were a willful deprivation of plaintiff's civil rights in contravention of &sect; 1983.

Marijuana was found in the trunk after the officers seized the vehicle to determine whether defendants had rightful possession of the car. Certiorari was granted to address whether the officers had good and sufficient cause to seize and inventory the leased car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were stopped while operating a car in Colorado with Florida license plates that had the word &quot;lease&quot; on them. The car was weaving on the highway. Defendants produced two rental contracts, one for a different car and one for the car in which they had been pulled over. Neither agreement was signed, and the officer noticed that the contract stated that the car could not be taken outside of Arizona or Nevada. The officers seized the car, but did not place defendants under arrest until the officers searched the trunk of the car, which contained marijuana. The court held that, although the officers had sufficient reasonable suspicion, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-5-107, to temporarily seize the car, there was no justification for their search of the trunk of the car. The search was justified neither as a protective weapons search nor as an inventory search. Thus, although for a different reasoning, the decision to suppress the evidence was affirmed because the search was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed, although for different reasons, and the suppression of the evidence was proper. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, holding that the citizens' construction of Colo. Const. art.

Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20 provided the people with greater direct control over government growth by, among other things, setting various spending and revenue limits and requiring voter approval of measures that would increase debt, spending, or taxes. Colo. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was implicated in the brutal robbery and murder of a woman, so he was convicted of several offenses and was sentenced the death. He subsequently filed a Rule 35 petition in the district court, but full relief was denied. The district court refused to vacate the death sentence, but it did vacate several of defendant's convictions. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not entitled to relief on several of the claims raised in his petition because they were either inadequately raised or they had already been litigated. The court further held that defendant had waived all alleged errors that did not rise to the level of constitutional error. The court then upheld several of the jury instructions that were challenged by defendant. The court, however, held that one of the instructions could not sustain defendant's conviction for first-degree sexual assault as a class 2 felony. The court also held that defendant failed to establish his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, the court held that the district court applied the proper factors in denying defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the denial of defendant's post-conviction relief petition and affirmed the district court's refusal to vacate his death sentence. The court, however, remanded defendant's conviction for first-degree sexual assault as a class 2 felony to the district court with directions to vacate that judgment and enter a judgment and sentence for the lesser included offense of first-degree sexual assault as a class 3 felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An escrow account requiring two signatures for withdrawal was established at a brokerage. After a dispute arose, one party allegedly withdrew the money, forged the customer's indorsement, and presented checks to a bank, which negotiated them. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the brokerage and the bank because the customer's action against them for breach of contract and negligence was barred by the statute of limitations. Holding that the statute was equitably tolled during the pendency of the customer's suit against the other party, the court of appeals reversed. The court granted certiorari and reversed. The case was remanded with directions to reinstate the district court's judgment. Because neither the actions of the brokerage and bank nor the lawsuit against the other party impeded the customer's right to file suit, the doctrine of equitable tolling did not prevent the statute of limitations from running. The customer's allegations of wrongdoing against the institutions existed independently of and were not inconsistent with his claim against the other party.</SPAN></P>

The state brought a petition for emergency relief in the nature of mandamus or prohibition, and the court issued a rule to show cause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of first-degree sexual assault and crime of violence for a sexual assault and was sentenced to a term of 14 years' imprisonment and one year of mandatory parole. Defendant asserted that his sentence was illegal because it violated the due process and equal protection clauses. Defendant asserted that sex offenders who had committed other, worse crimes were treated better because their non-sex-crime related sentences included mandatory parole, while the sex offense sentences included only discretionary parole. The intermediate appellate court found that defendant alleged sufficient facts supporting an equal protection claim and remanded to the trial court for development of the facts. On appeal, the court held that there was no equal protection violation because persons who committed different crimes and different combinations of crimes were not similarly situated.

Six months after the suspension, respondent filed motions for dissolution of the suspension order under Colo. Rules of Prof. Conduct 241.8, alleging that the state disciplinary process was facially, and as applied, a violation of due process and equal protection. Respondent's motions were denied. The court entered a judgment ordering that respondent be disbarred due to his knowing conversions of client funds. The court held that state lawyer disciplinary procedures were not per se unconstitutional because the investigative and prosecutorial functions were functionally separate from the decision-making function. It was noted that the procedure followed in respondent's temporary suspension did not violate due process. The court also found no merit to respondent's contention that his suspension violated equal protection because it was longer than that of other comparable cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An officer noticed a vehicle without the proper display of license plates or other registration. He initiated a traffic stop based upon what he saw, but when he approached the vehicle, he noticed that the proper license had simply been obstructed from his view. He continued to investigate, however, and asked defendant, who was the driver, for his personal identification. Upon producing his identification, defendant caused the exposure of a bag containing a controlled substance to fall into the view of the officer. Defendant was charged with the possession of the controlled substance, and he filed a motion to suppress the evidence. The trial court suppressed the evidence, and the state pursued an interlocutory appeal. The court affirmed the trial court's decision that the evidence had been seized in violation of defendant's constitutional rights. Even though the stop was justified by the officer's suspicions, the subsequent investigation was not justified because the initial reasons for the stop had been adequately cleared.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss the charges, finding that the statute violated equal protection guarantees. The court reversed on appeal. The court noted that it previously held that a portion of the second degree assault statute violated constitutional equal protection guarantees because a more severe sentence was required for attempt to commit bodily injury than was required for attempt to commit serious bodily injury. The court also held, however, that the constitutional violation could be remedied by severing the mandatory crime of violence sentencing provision under &sect; 18-3-203(2)(c) as it applied to attempted second degree assault under &sect; 18-3-203(1)(b), and by remanding the case for sentencing of defendant for commission of a class 4 felony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The initiative sought to add to four new paragraphs Colo. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 5. The court held that the Initiative violated the single subject requirement applicable to initiatives under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5.5), accordingly the court reversed the action of the Board. The court held that the Initiative encompassed more than one subject and was unconstitutional. The public trust water rights paragraphs of the Initiative imposed obligations on the state of Colorado to recognize and protect public ownership of water. The court could find no unifying or common objective between the district election paragraphs and the public trust doctrine paragraphs. The Initiative, if enacted, would have established election and boundary rules for water conservancy and conservation districts while also requiring effective enforcement and development of a &quot;strong public trust&quot; doctrine. Because the Initiative sought to accomplish more than one purpose, and the two purposes were not connected to each other, the Initiative violated the single subject provision of Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5.5). Under the constitutional provision, the Board erred in setting the Titles and Summary for the Initiative.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court determined that the record did not support a finding that defendant's residence was searched or any premises other than those described in the warrant.

The court held that the officers' execution of the warrant on a house located one-half block outside of their jurisdiction, while in violation of statutory prescriptions, did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. The court found that the search did not violate defendant's constitutional rights when all of the factors were taken into consideration. The court noted that the officers were unaware that they were acting outside of their jurisdiction and that they were in an area where the boundaries were unclear. The court also noted that the officers obtained a warrant, even though there was some exigency involved.

The court held that, under the objective observer test, it was not intuitively obvious that the monument had a predominant religious character.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-21-108 (1994) precluded them from claiming refunds. The court held that res judicata did not apply but that the four-year limitations period precluded appellants from claiming refunds for taxes paid in returns filed prior to June 16, 1985. First, because res judicata is not applicable to an earlier decision in the same lawsuit, the trial court erred in applying the doctrine. Second, no taxpayer may seek a refund of taxes in Colorado that were paid more than four years prior to the filing of a claim for a refund. The limitations period in &sect; 39-21-108(1)(a), in conjunction with 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6511(a), begins when the taxpayer filed the return or when the tax was paid, independently of a taxpayer's knowledge of an injury. It was essentially a statute of repose. Finally, the Davis decision could not provide the date on which the four-year limitations period began to run because Davis was not causally connected to appellants' injuries.</SPAN></P>

The court found that city streets were traditional public fora and that the trial court applied heightened review in accord with the standards applicable to content-neutral time, place or manner restrictions. City had sustained its burden of showing that the ordinance was not substantially broader than necessary to promote city's significant interest in traffic safety, and thus, was sufficiently narrowly tailored. Further tailoring to withstand constitutional scrutiny was not required. Finally, the court held because a presumption of constitutionality could be attached to the ordinance without impermissibly shifting the burden of proof, the trial court did not err in presuming the ordinance constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, board of county commissioners, two commissioners, and county residents (collectively, county), petitioned for certiorari review of the judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals in favor respondents, Public Highway Authority, its directors, and the state (collectively, authority). The authority claimed not to be subject to the election requirements of Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20(1) (Amendment 1) as it was an enterprise, not a district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Local governments entered into an agreement to form the authority to coordinate the planning, funding, and construction of a highway. The county brought an action against the authority to prevent the release of bond proceeds from pledged accounts, alleging that the authority was a district subject to the voter approval requirements of Amendment 1. On appeal, the court held that: 1) the resident, as a taxpayer, had standing to challenge the authority's action as contrary to Amendment 1; 2) the taxation powers granted to the authority under the Public Highway Authority Law, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 43-4-501 to -522 (1993), were inconsistent with the characteristics of a business and, thus, the authority was a district subject to Amendment 1's requirements; 3) the release of the bond proceeds and the remarketing scheme did not create any new debt and did not require approval; 4) the bonds did not impose a new debt on the county because they were payable from identifiable sources, not general tax revenues; and 5) the loan repayment was a new multi-year fiscal obligation that did require voter approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court rejected the appellate court's enterprise analysis. The court affirmed the holding that the debt and revenue expenditures prior to the effective date of Amendment 1 were not subject to Amendment 1. The court reversed the holding as to the repayment obligations undertaken by the authority since the effective date. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held: 1) the ordinance and Colo. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court held that the State could not use the evidence defendant disclosed in the civil securities action because defendant was entitled to immunity under Colo.

The court held that the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence because there was no basis for its finding that defendant was compelled to testify. The general order allowing expedited discovery in the civil action did not direct defendant to answer particular questions nor did it even mention him by name. Defendant produced the corporate documents requested by the subpoena and answered all the questions put to him during the deposition, rather than asserting the privilege against self-incrimination. Although he could have retained counsel to assist him during the deposition and with the civil investigation, he chose not to do so. The court found, therefore, that defendant was not compelled to testify within the meaning of &sect; 11-51-601(4) and was not entitled, either statutorily or constitutionally, to immunity from criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the state filed complaints in the water court pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-92-503 (1990) and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. In response, the ditch companies asserted an affirmative defense and argued that there was no lawful basis for the state's orders. The water court found that the ditch companies lacked standing because they were not harmed and enjoined them from further diversion of water. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that extending the traditional notion of plaintiff standing to the ditch companies that were simply attempting to defend themselves against suit was inappropriate. Because the ditch companies' affirmative defense did not constitute an independent cause of action, but was a defensive claim only, the rules for determining whether a plaintiff had standing were inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. The court found that the lower courts correctly classified the Colorado special offender statute as a sentence enhancing provision rather than a substantive offense. The court held that as a sentence enhancing provision, affirmative defenses did not apply. Because defendant was not entitled to an affirmative defense to the special offender charge, the trial court did not deny him due process of law nor the right to trial by jury in disallowing his defense of entrapment. The court held that Colorado had not unconstitutionally allocated factual elements between the substantive offense of cocaine distribution and the special offender provision. The court found that while the trial court's exclusion of testimony concerning internal DEA incentives for conviction of drug offenders violated defendant's Confrontation Clause rights, the exclusion was nevertheless harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment for the inspector and dismissed the action. Because of the brand inspector's continuing power of arrest, he was a &quot;law enforcement authority.&quot; Thus, the application of a one-year statute of limitations pursuant to &sect; 13-80-103(1)(c) was required.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18-3-206 (1986) and unlawful possession of a handgun by a juvenile, in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-108.5 (Supp. 1994). A hearing officer ordered the juvenile's continued detention, based upon Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-204(3)(a). Based on its holding that &sect; 19-2-204(3)(a)(III) was unconstitutional, the juvenile court ordered the juvenile's release and prohibited the state from detaining juvenile status offenders in secure facilities. On review, the court explained the directive of &sect; 19-2-204(3)(a)(III) that a juvenile is presumed dangerous to himself or herself or the community and may be ordered detained for the commission of certain crimes. The court held that the evidentiary presumption established by the statute did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof from the State to a juvenile at a detention hearing. Moreover, the court held that the statute contained sufficient procedural safeguards to satisfy the fundamental fairness doctrine applicable to juveniles. Lastly, the court reversed the portion of the juvenile's court's order prohibiting future application of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the action and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court found that it would be unjust to burden a co-employee with liability based on an officer's election to reject coverage under the act when the co-employee was covered by the act, and his or her exclusive remedy for any work-related injuries was dictated by the act. Therefore, the court held that the worker was immune from the president's common law action for negligence because the president rejected coverage under the act.

Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the charges prior to trial on the grounds that the statute was vague, overbroad, and unconstitutional. The trial court denied petitioner's motion. The district court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and affirmed petitioner's convictions. Petitioner sought review by certiorari. The court reversed and found that the disorderly conduct statute was not narrowly tailored to limit its application to fighting words. The court reasoned that because constitutionally protected speech may be threatening, the provision swept too broadly in its prohibition of unprotected speech and included protected speech as well. The court noted that even though petitioner's remarks were offensive, the statute could inhibit open, albeit abusive, debate concerning government officials or any other topic subject.

The district court denied the board's and assessor's motion for summary judgment and determined that the taxpayer was entitled to the statutory exemption for a recreational use in a public park as a matter of law. The district court also found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-3-135 was unconstitutional. The Property Tax Administrator for the State of Colorado (administrator) intervened on appeal. The board, assessor, and administrator claimed that the exemption for recreational use was not applicable and that the exemptions violated the equal protection and the supremacy clauses. The district court affirmed the district court's ruling that the taxpayer was exempt from property taxation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-3-135(4)(c). The court, however, reversed the district court's ruling that section Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-3-135 was unconstitutional as applied to users of federally owned real property because it violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner workers' compensation claimant was injured on the job and awarded workers' compensation benefits. An administrative law judge denied a request by respondent Colorado Compensation Insurance Authority (CCIA) for an offset and granted the claimant penalties against the CCIA, but later reversed the ruling that the claimant was entitled to penalties. The claimant filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the court of appeals pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. 8-43-307, which was denied. The court granted review of the order denying certiorari. The court held that &sect; 8-43-307 and Colo. R. App. 46(a) unconstitutionally denied workers' compensation claimants access to the courts by not providing a ruling on the merits by a court. The court held that decisions by respondent Colorado Industrial Cliams Office affected a claimant's substantive statutory rights and their right to access to the courts was not satisfied by the discretionary certiorari review by the court of appeals.

The officers could only give defendant a summons. The court held that the trial court erred in suppressing the cocaine because it was discovered during a lawful search incident to a non-custodial arrest. The court held that the officers could not make a full search incident to a custodial arrest, but they could make a limited search incident to a non-custodial arrest.

The ballot opponents' sole contention was that the ballot petitioners collected an insufficient number of valid signatures to include the initiative on the ballot because the circulators' affidavits did not include the statement that the circulator had read and understood the laws governing the circulation of petitions. The trial court agreed and entered an order vacating the secretary of state's determination of the sufficiency of the petition and enjoining the secretary from certifying the proposed initiative to the county clerks for inclusion on the ballot. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-60-1601, et seq. (1988). The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court held that because the inmate was detained for a criminal matter, the lower court correctly applied Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-45-101, and not Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-45-102. The court agreed with the lower court that the inmate did not assert the present violation of any fundamental liberty interest. The court found that the inmate's claim of former punitive segregation did not warrant a writ of habeas corpus because the inmate was not entitled to immediate discharge nor were there any violations of a fundamental constitutional right affecting the inmate's current conditions of confinement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with attempted murder, burglary, theft, kidnapping, assault, trespass, and five counts of violent crime. He entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and asserted the affirmative defense of impaired mental condition. He also filed a motion to suppress medical records of his psychiatric hospitalization in 1990, when at such time, he was evaluated and treated for mental health problems. The district court ruled that the physician/psychologist-patient and attorney-client privileges did not apply to psychiatric and psychological examinations conducted before the date of the offenses in question, and that providing the examination results did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The court agreed, holding that where a defendant tendered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity or asserted the affirmative defense of impaired mental condition, the defendant waived his right to claim the attorney-client and physician/psychologist-patient privileges pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-103.6, and consented to disclosure of pre- or post-offense information concerning his medical condition.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) granted the citizens' motion. The state and its officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state and its officials argued that the amendment was supported by several compelling state interests and was narrowly tailored to meet those interests.

The court held that the amendment, which affected the fundamental rights of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals to participate in the political process, was not the least restrictive means of ensuring religious liberty. Nor was the amendment narrowly tailored to serve the compelling governmental interest in ensuring the free exercise of religion. Therefore, the amendment was not supported by a compelling state interest. The amendment's targeted characteristics of sexual orientation, conduct, practices, and relationships were not severable. The Tenth Amendment did not give the state the right to violate fundamental federal rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An employee challenged a denial of certiorari to review his workers' compensation award. On appeal, the court reversed the denial of certiorari and held that the employee's right to access to the courts was violated by the application of the certiorari provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-307 (1993) and Colo. App. R. 46. The court found that the employee accrued substantive rights to workers' compensation pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-101-209. Thus, the court ruled that the employee was entitled to judicial review on the merits of the ICAO's decision. The court further found that the discretionary nature of the decision to grant certiorari review pursuant to Colo. App. R. 46(a) belied the mandatory nature of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 6. The court also determined that the effect of &sect; Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-307 and Colo. App. R. 46(a) was that the court of appeals was not required to make any ruling concerning a decision of the ICAO. Thus, the court ruled that review of a certiorari petition was not sufficient to satisfy the mandatory nature of the access to the courts provision of the Colorado Constitution because access to the courts required review on the merits.</SPAN></P>

Respondent State Board of Real Estate Appraisers (board) had sought the injunction for the appraiser's lack of compliance with the licensing requirements of the Real Estate Appraiser's Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-61-701 - 12-61-717 (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appraiser did not meet all of the licensing requirements of the Act. The board filed a complaint, and the trial court granted a permanent injunction to prohibit the appraiser from continuing to hold the elected office of county assessor. The appraiser argued that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for dismissal of the board's complaint. The court held that the qualifications for holding the office of county assessor provided for in Colo. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 10 were exclusive. Thus, the Colorado General Assembly was prohibited from imposing the additional qualifications contained in the Act. The Colorado Constitution, unlike the federal Constitution, comprised a limitation on power. Also, the fact that the framers of the state constitution chose to specify the qualifications for the county assessor office limited, by implication, the legislature's power to impose additional qualifications. Further, many other constitutional provisions prescribing qualifications for constitutional offices specifically provided that the legislature has discretion to establish additional qualifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayers sought declaratory and injunctive relief and to invalidate several ballot issues proposed by defendants, a city, a county, and a school district, and adopted at a general election. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city, the county, and the school district's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the Colorado Court of Appeals transferred the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The school district had sought to increase its debt and taxes for the repayment of the debt. The city sought to grant a franchise to the state's public service company to furnish, sell, and distribute gas and electricity in the city and to increase the city's debt. The county sought to increase the tax annually. Though the issues presented by the school district, the city, and the county passed at the general election, the taxpayers claimed that the ballot issues violated Colo. Const. Art. X, &sect; 20. They argued that the measures sought (1) approval of a consolidated debt and tax increase; (2) approval of unlimited general obligation bonds; (3) to exempt the entities from future voter approval of tax rate increases, among other claims. They also argued that the trial court erred in not applying the substantial compliance standard. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the taxpayers claim against the school district and the county because their proposals substantially complied with the requirements of art. X, &sect; 20. But the court ruled that the city's proposal to raise ad valorem taxes were invalid and did not substantially comply with the requirements of art X, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's rulings as to dismissal of taxpayers' claims against the school district and the county and as to summary judgment in favor of the city in its franchise proposal. The court reversed as to the city's proposal to raise ad valorem property taxes, ordering its severance from the remainder of that measure. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation was a common carrier of goods that provided trucking service. The corporation held common carrier authority pursuant to Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity No. 205. The corporation presented evidence of the need for a specialized &quot;just in time&quot; transportation service. The corporation asserted that the PUC applied the wrong standard of public need by finding that the testimony of a single customer did not establish the requisite public need to amend a common carrier's certificate of public convenience and necessity. The court held that the doctrine of regulated competition required the PUC to deny an application for common carrier authority if granting the application would create &quot;excessive&quot; or &quot;destructive&quot; competition. The controlled consideration was the public need. Here, the customer's needs and preferences were probative of a &quot;public need&quot; for competitive services. By itself, such evidence did not constitute a public need. Thus, the PUC applied the correct standard of public need, was not arbitrary or capricious, and had a rational basis in the record. The claimed public need for lower prices would not be met by granting the application.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-123.6, (1993) violated the principle of separation of powers found in Colo. Const. art. III. Defendant also filed a separate notice of appeal challenging his convictions for possession and possession of marihuana with intent to distribute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-18-106(4)(b), (8)(b) (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence. After the motion was denied, defendant was convicted of possession of marihuana with the intent to distribute and of possession of marihuana. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecution requested that defendant be ordered to surrender his license, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-123.6. The trial court refused, however, ruling that it was an unconstitutional violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine to compel the court to take a convicted defendant's driver's license for forwarding to the Department of Revenue. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that while the anonymous tip, by itself, did not create a reasonable inference that an informant had access to reliable information, the officer's independent investigation of that tip provided a substantial basis to determine that probable cause existed to search a residence. The court further held that &sect; 42-2-123.6's requirement that the trial court forward a defendant's driver's license to the Department of Revenue did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction but reversed the trial court's ruling that license-revocation statute violated the separation-of-powers doctrine under the state's constitution and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court held that defendant was entitled to a dismissal because the time allowed for speedy trial had expired. It found that a police officer's testimony should have been suppressed because the destruction of a tape recording was not subject to bad-faith analysis or, alternatively, the intentional destruction of the tape amounted to bad faith per se. The court reasoned that the trial court's initial dismissal of the charge rendered it a nullity and defendant was no longer affected by speedy trial concerns. It further reasoned that when the case was remanded, the speedy-trial period began running anew and the trial began within the 90-day speedy-trial period of Colo. Mun. Ct. R. 248. It observed that, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-405(5.1) (1986), defendant waived the claim that his speedy trial right had been violated because his attorney did not object to the trial date set by the trial court. The court declined to rule on whether a showing of bad faith was required before a defendant could claim that destruction of evidence violated his due process rights because a prior appellate holding that there was no due process violation became the law of the case.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the trooper's actions comported with the Fourth Amendment, and thus he was entitled to immunity from liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trooper's decision to not issue a citation after he had stopped the driver's vehicle was not willful and wanton conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Based on anonymous tips, a narcotics officer secured the use of a television station's helicopter and conducted a fly-over of defendant's residential property. A greenhouse was observed. Through another tip the officer learned that defendant had moved the plants. A search warrant was obtained and evidence was seized from defendant's house. Defendant's convictions were affirmed on appeal. The court granted certiorari. The court held that the fly-over did not constitute a search, the warrant was valid, and the helicopter pilot was properly granted newsperson's immunity. The totality of the circumstances indicated that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. The helicopter was flying within the Federal Aviation Administration guidelines and the observation posed a very limited degree of intrusiveness. Thus, the fly-over did not constitute a search under the federal constitution. Furthermore, the protections of the state constitution did not extend to investigative activity that did not amount to a search. Because the pilot was operating as a newsperson, his observations and knowledge regarding the fly-over were protected by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-119 (1993).</SPAN></P>

The people appealed the decision of the lower court and claimed that the statute of limitations began to run upon conviction in the trial court. On appeal, the court examined the statutory language and concluded that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until defendant's appeals were exhausted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Corporation sought to establish the right to withdraw 200,000 acre-feet of ground water from proposed wells located on its land. Corporation argued that its predecessors, Mexican and Spanish governments, obtained title to the lands and all rights to underground water, whether tributary or not, underlying that tract. These rights were later conveyed to corporation. However, the court held that title did not derive from the Mexican government or its Spanish predecessor. The court also rejected corporation's argument that Congress intended to convey the land to predecessor, because the court determined that such a reading of the statute conflicted with the principals of statutory construction that required land grants to be construed in favor of the United States. The court found sufficient evidence to support the district court's determination that the water sought to be withdrawn was tributary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The executor argued that the instant claims were barred by res judicata because a decree 20 years earlier had settled the issue of ownership of the property.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 38-36-101 to -198 (1982 &amp; Supp. 1993). The residents argued that the decedent failed to provide them with the required notice under Colo. R. Civ. P. 4(h) and that their names or the names of their predecessor in interest were or should have been known to the decedent at the time he filed his application, so the prior judgment was void. The reviewing court found that they had raised factual issues, so the grant of summary judgment was inappropriate. Here, the decedent only provided notice by publication, so there remained an issue whether the decedent had exercised reasonable diligence in locating the residents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The proposed initiative would add a new section to Colo. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 11, permitting limited gaming in the city of Antonito, expanding the games permitted by the gaming commission, and reducing the maximum allowable tax rate. The electors contended that the Board lacked jurisdiction because the proponents failed to comply with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-40-104, 1B (1993 Supp.). The draft of the initiative listed only one proponent with no address. The court disagreed with the electors that the Board lacked authority on this basis. The requirement of two proponents contained in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-40-104, 1B (1993 Supp.) was a procedural requirement for efficient notification. The electors also contended that the title, submission clause, and summary fixed by the Board did not fairly express the true meaning and intent of the initiative. The Board had to consider any public confusion that might be caused by misleading titles, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-40-106(3)(b) (1993 Supp.). The court agreed with the electors in part. The title and submission clause were misleading with regard to the order in which the material was presented. The initiative addressed statewide and local concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant local officials challenged the judgment striking the ordinance banning the sale, manufacture, and possession of assault weapons, Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code app. art. IV, &sect;38-130 (1989), as violative of the state constitution. The court first held that the proper standard for review was whether the ordinance was a reasonable regulation of the exercise of the right to bear arms, set forth in Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 13. The trial court erroneously held that the right was fundamental and applied strict scrutiny analysis. The ordinance served a legitimate governmental interest, curbing crime, which was sufficiently strong to justify its enactment, and the ordinance was reasonably related to the interest. Further, the restriction was not burdensome. The court reversed the trial court's finding that &sect; 38-130(b)(1)(b), (e) were overbroad and limiting the definition of covered weapons in &sect; 38-130(h). The court also concluded that the trial court correctly found &sect; 38-130(b)(1)(c) to be unconstitutionally vague because a person of common intelligence would not know their pistol's design history and action, but held that the subsection was severable from the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the part of the judgment finding a subsection of the ordinance banning the sale, manufacture, and possession of assault weapons unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The petitioner was convicted of nine drug-related offenses, and also convicted of five habitual criminal counts. His life sentence was vacated after the trial court found that the habitual counts involved serious, but not violent counts. The people argued that the trial court applied the wrong standard to evaluate the constitutionality of the life sentence. The petitioner contended that the trial court applied a legally erroneous standard of &quot;justifiable excuse or excusable neglect,&quot; to bar his collateral attack on his five previous convictions. The court held that the mandatory life sentence which the trial court was required to impose on the petitioner under the habitual criminal statute was not grossly disproportionate to his crimes in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court stated that life sentences constitutionally could be imposed under a recidivist-sentencing scheme even though the felonies supporting the sentence did not involve violence. The criterion for imposing a life sentence was that the crimes be serious, not violent. The court also held that the trial court did not err in denying the petitioner's collateral attack of his prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's primary contention was that, based on the language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-103(4) and the decisional law of the state, the same jury that convicted him on the substantive felony counts could not have been reassembled to hear the habitual criminal counts, and hence the appellate court's remand order had to have been set aside. The court agreed, holding that the jury empaneled to try the substantive offense charged should have decided whether defendant was adjudicated a habitual criminal. The court held that the same jury which determined defendant's guilt on the pending substantive offense must have also resolved the validity of the habitual criminal charge. The court held that in sum, both statutory and decisional law served to nullify the effect of the appellate court's reversal of the dismissal of the habitual criminal charge against defendant, inasmuch as settled law prohibited a retrial on that charge. Accordingly, as to its remand for trial only, the judgment of the appellate court was reversed and its order set aside.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The People appealed an order finding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-306, 8B was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face under the state and federal constitutions and dismissing the charge against defendant after he wrote a threatening letter to a judge and other public officials. Defendant was charged and found guilty of disorderly conduct. Defendant argued that the letter was written to merely criticize the judge's ruling in his disorderly conduct case after he was charged with attempting to influence a public officer. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-306 clearly prohibited a person from using deceit or threats of violence or economic reprisal to influence a public servant's actions. The statute was narrowly tailored to enable the People to proscribe the type of conduct that rose to a level of criminal culpability. The forceful language of defendant's letter went beyond a mere expression of criticism and was not protected speech. Therefore, the trial court's order dismissing the case was reversed and the charge was reinstated against defendant because defendant failed to prove that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state's new registration fee schedule laws were based upon weight of vehicle and annual mileage in state that were used in interstate commerce.

Realizing it could not implement the new law by the effective date, the state issued credit for fees paid at the county level and applied it to the registration fee. Both companies sought refunds and were denied. The companies sued. The trial court declared Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-3-123(13)(b), (b.3), and 42-3-105 facially unconstitutional. The court denied attorney fees. On appeal, the court reversed the finding that the state's implementation of &sect; 42-3-123(13)(b), (b.3) were unconstitutional because the implementation did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The court reversed summary judgment in favor of state on grain company's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim and remanded for determination of grain company's claim for attorney fees under &sect; 1988.

II, &sect;&sect; 36-16 to 36-108 (1979 &amp; Supps.), (ordinance) imposed an income tax upon plaintiff companies in violation of Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the city assessed sales taxes against the companies under the ordinance, the companies filed a declaratory judgment action against the city and the finance director. When the district court ruled that the ordinance imposed an income tax upon the companies in violation of the state constitution, the city and the finance director appealed. The court reversed. As applied to the companies, the tax operated as a constitutionally permissible sales tax and not as an income tax. The ordinance demonstrated that the tax fell on the customers of a retail business. When a person purchased a service from the companies' machines, that person was the companies' customer. The control exercised by the companies over the machines and the distribution of the money in the machines belied the claim that the purchasers were customers only of the location owners. The companies were retailers or vendors under the ordinance and were subject to the sales tax collection and payment obligations imposed by the ordinance. The companies owned the machines. They placed the machines at the sites, and selected the machines that were placed, and had access to the money in the machines.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The prosecution contended that the evidence should be admitted because an anonymous letter informed a detective of defendant's alleged illegal activities and that evidence would be found at his home.

The court concluded that the affidavit that resulted in the search warrant did not set forth sufficient facts to allow a magistrate to find probable cause to search defendant's home and that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule and 8A Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-308 (1986) were inapplicable. The court found that the letter was from an unidentified informant of unknown reliability and contained a vague and brief reference to illegal activity surrounded by innocuous details. Under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, there was no substantial basis for concluding that defendant was engaged in any illegal activity. The detective's reliance on the warrant was unreasonable because he knew, or should have known, that his affidavit, which was based on the letter, was insufficient to establish probable cause.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-203 (1973). The inmate appealed an order from the District Court, Crowley County (Colorado), which dismissed his petition for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The district court dismissed the petition because the inmate did not allege that he was entitled to immediate release. On appeal, the inmate argued that the parole board's unwillingness to grant release or parole on the ground that he refused to attend the sex offender's program and that he needed more treatment was unjustified. He claimed that he was entitled to a parole board hearing to determine whether he continued to pose a threat to the public. The court affirmed the order that denied his petition for habeas corpus because the decision to grant parole or absolute release to an inmate incarcerated for an indeterminate sentence under the Act was vested within the sound discretion of the parole board. The inmate had not alleged facts showing that he was entitled to immediate release; instead he asserted only that he believed that after a hearing the parole board would exercise its discretion to grant him parole or release. Upon that mere speculation, the district court did not err in denying his petition. A petition for habeas corpus was not an available remedy for the alleged failure of the parole board to grant the inmate absolute release or parole.</SPAN></P>

Defendant later moved to dismiss the habitual criminal charges on the basis that the guilty pleas upon which the prior convictions were based were unconstitutionally obtained.

The trial court ordered him to be examined to determine his competency. Defendant filed a motion to terminate the criminal proceeding pursuant to section 8A Colo. Rev.

The trial court did not terminate the proceeding and the district attorney refused to file a motion to dismiss the criminal proceeding. After another hearing, the trial court dismissed the charges against defendant and ordered civil commitment. The prosecution appealed and the court reversed the holding and remanded the case with directions. The court held that 8A Colo. Rev.

The district court found on behalf of the Commission and the carrier appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission had the authority under &sect; 40-6-120(1) to grant temporary authority to enable motor common carrier service for which there appeared to be an immediate need and which was not being serviced. The temporary authority was to extend for 180 days or, for good cause, until a final administrative decision was made. The Commission granted temporary authority to a common motor carrier. Before the temporary authority expired, the common motor carrier filed a request for an extension, but the Commission did not make a decision until after the temporary authority expired. The carrier alleged it was available to service the territory. On appeal, the court held that the Commission had the jurisdiction to act upon a request for extension of temporary authority that was timely filed and acted upon within a reasonable timeframe. The Commission's decision was not ex post facto legislation. The district court did not err in finding that there was good cause to extend the temporary authority.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18-3-207(1) was unconstitutionally overbroad, whether the trial court erred by denying a proposed jury instruction defining threat, and whether the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal when the prosecutor presented no evidence that the defendant acted without legal authority. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 18-3-207(1) was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The court held that a statute properly may criminalize threats which constitute fighting words provoking immediate violence. However, the court held that not all threats fall outside the scope of protected speech. The court held that speech does not lose its protected character simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action. The court held that &sect; 18-3-207(1) was facially overbroad because it also covered threats of collective action in support of group demands.

Upon her return to good health, the mother sought to have the arrangement changed back to joint custody. The lower courts ordered the modification back to joint custody. The father appealed. The court affirmed, holding that because the legislature expressly endorsed a public policy that encouraged divorced parents to share custody of their children whenever reasonable and because the language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-131.5(4) (1987) plainly and unambiguously applied to any order regarding a change from sole custody to joint custody. The court found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-131.5(4) (1987) was controlling. Only upon a showing of physical or emotional harm to the child, standards set out in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-131 (1987), might there have been a successful change in sole custody from the mother as sole custodian to the father as sole custodian.

P. 35(c), defendant filed a motion to vacate his convictions for two counts of sexual assault on a child, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405, 8B (1986), on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel, an issue not raised in his earlier appeal. The District Court of Boulder County (Colorado) denied the motion on the ground that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402, 8A prohibited the filing thereof. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After defendant's convictions were affirmed, the trial court summarily denied defendant's motion to vacate the convictions. On appeal, defendant contended that &sect; 16-5-402(3) violated the due process guarantees of the federal and state constitutions. The court agreed, holding that, by barring constitutional challenges to convictions simply because the case had been appealed, &sect; 16-5-402(3) violated the Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. Of all persons convicted of crimes, only those who asserted their rights to appeal were denied the right to challenge an unconstitutional conviction, whether on grounds of newly discovered evidence, the trial court's lack of jurisdiction, or ineffective assistance of counsel. Such deprivation of any ability to challenge the constitutional validity of a conviction denied fundamental fairness to persons convicted of criminal offenses. Defendant also was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant's right to testify may have been infringed by defense counsel's failure to seek suppression of a prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the district court applied the correct legal standard during the sentencing process and properly applied and evaluated the pertinent statutory mitigating factors; (2) defendant's prior first degree murder convictions were properly admitted as statutory aggravators because &quot;previous conviction&quot; under the statute included any conviction obtained prior to the date of the sentencing hearing; and (3) the manner in which defendant disposed of the body, which occurred the day after the homicide, was not properly considered under the especially heinous statutory aggravator, but the error was harmless. Thus, the court held that the sentence was constitutionally reliable and possessed the heightened degree of certainty that was required in capital sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner, a quasi-municipal corporation and a state subdivision (district), sought a writ of certiorari to review a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Colorado). The court of appeals held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1-401(2)(f) (1993 Supp.) applied to a dispute between the district and respondent railroad company and that the railroad company's written consent was required for the inclusion of its property within the district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the automatic exemption of property used for railroad purposes was removed from the 1955 Metropolitan Recreation District Act (MRDA), a district began proceedings to include certain property owned by a railroad within its borders. The railroad argued that its written consent was first required. The trial court entered judgment for the district. The court of appeals reversed. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Section 32-1-401(2)(f) of the Special District Act, which had replaced the MRDA, applied to the dispute; the plain meaning of the statute indicated that written consent was required to include railroad property, whether the property was annexed or already located within a district's boundaries. Consent was thus required for inclusion of railroad property continuously owned by the railroad company since the district had been formed. However, the record was unclear regarding property that was acquired by the railroad company after the formation of the district or property that was reacquired by the railroad company after the MRDA was amended. Remand was proper to determine whether the past use of this property was for railroad purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the court of appeals' interpretation of a statute that the district had to obtain the railroad company's written consent before acquiring its property that was used for railroad purposes. However, the previous use of some of the railroad's property could not be discerned from the record. The court thus reversed the judgment in part and remanded with directions for a further hearing to determine the prior use of this property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In two unrelated cases consolidated for review, the state appealed decisions from the District Court, Pueblo County (Colorado), dismissing the count against defendants that charged sexual assault on a child as a part of a pattern of sexual abuse. The trial court found the sentence enhancement statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405(2)(c) (1986 &amp; 1993 Supp.), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The two defendants were charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child, the first was sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust in violation of &sect; 18-3-405.3 (1986 &amp; 1993 Supp.) and the second was under &sect; 18-3-405(2)(c) (1986 &amp; 1993 Supp.). The sentence enhancement statute increased the punishment for sexual assault on a child from a class 4 felony to a class 3 felony if the jury found that the offense was committed as a part of a pattern of sexual abuse. The trial courts found the statute unconstitutional because it was vague, it did not provide guidelines on how to show a pattern, and it gave inadequate notice of the proscribed conduct. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found no merit to defendants' argument that pattern required more than two acts. The court found the statute sufficiently clear when it defined pattern as two or more proven acts of sexual conduct by the same actor on the same victim. The legislature clearly intended that two acts made a pattern. The statute was not void for vagueness when it described the forbidden conduct sufficiently so that a person of common intelligence could readily understand its meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the orders of the trial court in both cases declaring the sentence enhancement statute unconstitutional and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

App. R. 49(a)(1), the State of Colorado petitioned for certiorari to review a judgment from the District Court of El Paso County (Colorado), which affirmed the county court's dismissal of the charge of harassment against respondent accused on the ground that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(1)(g) (1986) was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1991, the accused was charged with harassment under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(1)(g) (1986). Upon the accused's motion, the county court dismissed the charge, accepting the argument that this statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The district court affirmed the dismissal on the same grounds. On certiorari review the court found that &sect; 18-9-111(1)(g) was anything but narrowly drawn and was overbroad in violation of the protections of free speech afforded by U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10. The court further held that judicial limitation on &sect; 18-9-111(1)(g), such as obscenity or &quot;fighting words,&quot; in order to make the statute constitutional, would violate rules of statutory construction and render the statute vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner doctors brought claims of breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentations, and bad faith when respondent insurer that provided malpractice insurance withdrew from the Colorado market. Petitioners contended that the contract could not be modified unilaterally by respondent since the policy was continuous in nature. After a lengthy bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of petitioners, concluding that respondent had breached its duty of good faith by knowingly engaging in an unreasonable pattern of conduct. It also awarded punitive damages. On appeal, the lower appellate court reversed, holding that the provisions of the policies' durations were unambiguous and entered judgment in favor of respondent. On further judicial review, the court held that the duration of the policy was ambiguous, that it should be construed in favor of petitioners, that respondent fraudulently misrepresented its intentions with regard to its commitment to serving the Colorado market, and that it engaged in bad faith insurance practices under the circumstances in which it nonrenewed the independent physicians.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Student athletes filed a class action regarding the constitutionality of the random, suspicionless drug testing program of the university. The trial court entered an order enjoining the university from continuing their drug testing program and held that the testing was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the order. Based on a balancing of the privacy interests of the student athletes and the governmental interests of the university, the court held that the university's drug-testing program was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect;7. The court held that the student athletes did not have a lower expectation of privacy and that the program was significantly intrusive. The court did not find that the testing promoted a compelling governmental interest. The consents given by the student athletes were not found to be voluntarily given because the failure to consent resulted in the denial of a governmental benefit, participation in intercollegiate athletics, to which the court accorded significant weight.</SPAN></P>

The suit alleged that privatization of certain state jobs violated the Civil Service Amendment, Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13 and Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The public employees contended that the trial court erred in dismissing their claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies by filing protests to their terminations with the state personnel board. The public employees argued that exhaustion of administrative remedies was unnecessary because administrative relief was inadequate or futile. The court reversed the judgment because the trial court erred in concluding that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies required dismissal. In so holding, the court determined that the claims for relief asserted in the complaint required a determination of the facial constitutionality of legislation that eliminated funding for 27 full-time equivalent positions in the department and requesting the department to contract with private employers for the services previously provided by the employees, thus it raised two constitutional issues for adjudication. The court concluded that because the board lacked authority to determine the two constitutional issues asserted by the public employees, thus the board could not resolve all the issues raised by the employees.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the order was facially unconstitutional only if it was not restricted to employees that held safety- or security-sensitive positions or did not require reasonable suspicion of alcohol or drug use. The order was not explicitly limited to safety-sensitive positions. However, the court found that the order, read as a whole and granting it a presumption of constitutionality, encompassed a concern for the dangers of drug impairment while performing one's duties. As to drug testing for suspected off-duty drug use by those in safety-sensitive positions, the order clearly required reasonable suspicion.

The trial court denied defendant's motion seeking a declaration that &sect; 18-8-210.1 violated equal protection and due process guarantees of the United States and Colorado Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was adjudicated a delinquent for conduct, which, if committed by an adult, constituted second degree burglary of a dwelling and possession of burglary tools. After defendant was 18 years old, he was sentenced to confinement in the county jail and subsequently assigned to a work-release facility. Defendant was charged with escape after leaving the facility without authorization. Defendant was convicted as charged. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 18-8-210.1 did not create two classes of similarly situated persons and did not violate defendant's equal protection or due process rights. While defendant was confined because of his adjudication as a delinquent, he was convicted and sentenced as an adult escapee and his liberty interest was not equivalent to that of a juvenile. The legislative decision to incarcerate an adult, who escaped from confinement imposed as a juvenile, based on the gravity of the escapee's conduct committed as a juvenile, did not offend due process guarantees. The penalty was reasonably related to the legitimate purpose of providing relatively severe punishments for adult escapees confined because of grave conduct committed as juveniles.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, in the absence of any genuine issue of fact, summary judgment was appropriate. The city's provisions in its charter for the appointment, service, and dismissal of municipal judges were reasonable and consistent with expectations of all judicial officers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant state adopted a voter-initiated constitutional amendment, which prohibited the enactment of any statute that gave individuals protected status based on their sexual orientation. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants, governor, attorney general, and state, from enforcing this amendment, and the court affirmed. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. XIV protected individuals' fundamental right to participate equally in the political process and that this constitutional amendment, which infringed upon this right by &quot;fencing out&quot; a class of persons, was subject to strict scrutiny in order to determine its constitutional validity. The court rejected defendants' argument that the right of equal political participation only applied to traditionally suspect classes. The court also held that plaintiffs, individuals and government entities, met their threshold burden for obtaining a preliminary injunction by establishing that enjoining the enforcement of this amendment was necessary to protect their rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and that defendants did not proffer any compelling state interest to justify enactment of this amendment.</SPAN></P>

Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 7-8-1(C), 7-8-5(B) (1985). The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the city's petition, and the city appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city argued that the fee imposed on the land and colleges boards was not a special assessment, and that collection of the fees was authorized by law. The court held that: (1) the fees authorized by &sect;&sect; 7-8-1(C), 7-8-5(B) did not constitute a special assessment, but rather were fees for services that benefitted the property; (2) Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 31-35-401(1), 402(1)(f) authorized the collection of the fees that were charged to the colleges board; (3) the land board's payment of the fees charged by the city constituted an appropriate expenditure for the maintenance and benefit of the property it allegedly owned; (4) thus, the trial court and the court of appeals erred in concluding that the city was prohibited from imposing the service fee on the colleges and land boards; and (5) because the premise underlying the award of attorney fees was incorrect, the trial court and appeals court erred in concluding that the colleges and land boards were entitled to awards of attorney fees against the city pursuant to Colo.

In a separate case, the State also appealed the decision of the appellate court vacating another defendant's life sentence as a habitual criminal (narcotics).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court first determined that an abbreviated form of proportionality review was appropriate in both cases.

The court further concluded that an abbreviated form of proportionality review was warranted and that the court could conduct such a review in both of the cases. Based upon the court's previous holdings, as well as its examination of federal law, a defendant's age should not be considered in determining whether a sentence was disproportionate under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Thus, the court found that both defendants were not entitled to an extended proportionality review simply because their respective life expectancies did not exceed the 40-year period of parole ineligibility. The court held that the existing record in both cases were sufficient for the purpose of conducting an abbreviated proportionality review. In so doing, the court found that the defendants' sentences were not disproportionate in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, finding that the offenses were committed one year prior to the effective date of &sect; 18-19-103. However, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress a pistol and a container containing one rock of suspected crack cocaine. The officers had a search warrant for a disco, the parking lots, and certain persons based on drug activity and weapons offenses. An officer was justified in doing a pat-down search of defendant in front of the disco, finding a weapon in the process. Defendant was placed under arrest and the search incident to his lawful arrest revealed the drugs. There was an articulable and specific basis in fact for suspecting that criminal activity had occurred and was in progress. The pat-down was reasonable and the scope and character of the intrusion was reasonably related to its purpose of searching for weapons.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that, although the individuals made a prima facie case of purposeful racial discrimination in the selection of the venire, the state met its burden to articulate a race-neutral explanation. The discrimination was rebutted through testimony of those familiar with the selection process, testimony that the exclusion of Spanish-surnamed persons from the venire was consistent with the application of race-neutral criteria, testimony of those who worked closely with the chief judge, and testimony that persons with Spanish surnames were included on other grand juries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The prisoner violated his parole twice, once in 1989 and once in 1991. Based on these violations the prisoner's credit for parole time was revoked by the Director pursuant to &sect; 17-22.5-303(7). The prisoner filed a writ of habeas corpus alleging that &sect; 17-22.5-303(7) was an ex post facto law as applied to him. The district court agreed with the prisoner and the Director sought review. On appeal the court reversed the district court's findings. The court held that two critical elements must be present for a criminal statute to be stricken down as an ex post facto law: it must be retrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must disadvantage the offender affected by it. The court held the acts, which triggered the application of &sect; 17-22.5-303(7), occurred well after the 1987 effective date of the contested statute. Thus, the prisoner had the requisite fair warning of the consequences of violating the conditions of his parole. The court held that the prisoner was not disadvantaged because the application of &sect; 17-22.5-303(7) did not constitute punishment beyond that originally imposed on the prisoner by the sentencing court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that defendant was entitled to reversal of his conviction and sentence for second-degree assault because, as it had held previously, the sentencing scheme under &sect; 18-3-203(2)(c) was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 18-3-203(2)(c) violated defendant's equal protection rights because it enhanced the sentence for the crime with the less culpable mental state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a consolidated appeal, defendant sought review of orders of the District Court, Jefferson County (Colorado), which denied his motions under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) to vacate judgments of conviction entered against him in two separate criminal cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In the first case, defendant filed the Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 motion 13 years after his conviction for robbery under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-301 (1973). In the second case, defendant's motion was filed 11 years after his conviction for attempted escape under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-208.1(2) (1973). The trial court denied both motions because neither was filed within the time limitations set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(1) (1986). The trial court found that defendant's delay was not caused by excusable neglect or justifiable excuse under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(2)(d) (1986). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings as to the existence of justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. Although the court held that an irreconcilable conflict existed between Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(3) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-410(1), defendant lacked standing to challenge the defect because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(3) did not apply to the facts. However, the trial court did not have the benefit of the standards set forth by the court for evaluating a claim of justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. Therefore, a remand was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court orders, which denied defendant's motions to vacate the judgments of conviction, and remanded the cases to the trial court to determine whether defendant's delay in filing the late motions was based upon justifiable excuse or excusable neglect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant filed a motion pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) to vacate his felony conviction. The trial court held that defendant had not filed his motion within the period that was prescribed by Colo. Rev. Stat. tit. 8A, &sect; 16-5-402(1986), which limited the time for commencing collateral attacks on criminal convictions, and denied the motion. On appeal defendant argued that &sect; 16-5-402 was unconstitutional and inapplicable to his Rule 35(c) motion, or, alternatively, that if &sect; 16-5-402 was applicable, then the trial court erred in concluding that he failed to show justifiable excuse or excusable neglect for his late filing. The court affirmed application of &sect; 16-5-402 to Rule 35(c) motions because such a construction of the statute was necessary in order to effectuate the legislative intent to preclude stale and repetitive attacks on criminal convictions. However the court remanded so that the trial court could consider defendant's justifiable excuse or excusable neglect claim by balancing the interests under the facts of the case so as to give effect to the overriding concern that defendant have the meaningful opportunity required by due process to challenge his conviction.</SPAN></P>

The first question before the court was whether any lottery proceeds dedicated pursuant to Colo. Const. art. XXVII were subject to the limitation on state fiscal year spending set forth in Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20(7)(a). The court answered this question in the affirmative. The court concluded that Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20 (Amendment 1) and Colo. Const. art. XXVII (Amendment 8) were not in irreconcilable, material, and direct conflict. Amendment 1 did not authorize what Amendment 8 forbade or forbade what Amendment 8 authorized. Senate Bill 93-74 represented a reasonable resolution of the implicit conflict between the two amendments and gave effect to the expression of the will of the people in enacting both amendments. Further, the court held that, in response to the second question, the General Assembly could not enact limitations on revenues collected by the Limited Gaming Control Commission, created in Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 19-5-304(2) provided that an officer of the court, could be appointed to inspect confidential adoption records in order to identify and serve as an intermediary to arrange possible contact with sought-after relatives. The juvenile court received word from the Colorado Attorney General that it was considering declaring the statute unconstitutional, but the juvenile court declared it unconstitutional on its own. The court reversed the juvenile court's denial of the adoptees' motions for appointment of a confidential intermediary and reversed the unconstitutional holding. The court reasoned that none of the adoptees claimed that the Confidential Intermediary Statute was unconstitutional, and there were no adverse parties at the ex parte hearings before the juvenile court. The court found that the juvenile court's ruling that the statute was unconstitutional was an impermissible exercise of judicial authority and was based on the juvenile court's own interpretation of Colorado case law. Since the matter did not fall within the exceptions recognized which permitted sua sponte consideration of a constitutional question, the court found the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-64-101 to -503 (1992 Supp.). The pathology group cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient underwent unnecessary surgery due to the pathology group's mislabeling of laboratory slides. The pathology group admitted liability and the case was submitted to a jury on the issue of damages. The noneconomic and derivative losses found by the jury were reduced to comply with a cap on damages imposed under 6A Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-302 (1992 Supp.), a section of the Health Care Availability Act (HCAA), 6A Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-64-101 to -503 (1992 Supp.). On appeal, the court rejected the patient's challenge to the constitutionality of the HCAA, holding that the act clearly satisfied the rational basis test. However, the court held that the trial court erred in distinguishing between past and future damages for purposes of the prejudgment interest statute and in only applying prejudgment interest for the amount of past damages awarded. In addition, the court ruled that prejudgment interest was not included within the $ 1 million damage limitation provisions of the HCAA. The trial court was also ordered, on remand, to make findings of fact regarding its award of costs to the patient and his wife.</SPAN></P>

The court also ordered the trial court to reconsider its award of actual costs. In all other respects, the judgment awarded under the Health Care Availability Act was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

While the disciplinary proceeding was pending, the attorney filed suit, alleging that DR 7-107(G) was unconstitutional.

The court held that criminal legislation was not constitutionally infirm simply because the offender's conduct violated more than one statutory proscription and that the fact that appellee state could exercise discretion as to the statute under which it prosecuted appellant did not violate the tenets of equal protection. Appellant also contended that remarks made by the prosecutor during the cross-examination of appellant concerning his prior felony conviction were unduly prejudicial and denied him a fair trial.

The trial court held that the insurance agency correctly applied An Act Concerning the Regulation of the Bail Bond Business, 1988 Colo. Sess. Laws 480, 480-84.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bail bondsmen had licenses under the rules for such licenses prior to the Act. The bail bondsmen had felony convictions which would have barred a license except if the factors in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-5-101 (1988) of the Ex-Offenders' Rights Act were considered. A license had to be renewed annually, but the licenses were not renewed under the new rules because of the bail bondsmens' felonies. On appeal, the court found that the insurance agency properly denied the licenses. The insurance agency retroactively applied the new law. However, the clear language of the statute showed a legislative intent to delete reference to the Ex-Offenders' Rights Act, which overcame the presumption that new statutes should be applied prospectively only. The insurance agency did not act retrospectively pursuant to Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11 since the new law did not impair a vested right. The bail bondsmen had no vested right in a license that expired annually. Nor did the bail bondsmen have a property interest in the renewal of the licenses requiring procedural due process. The public policy goal of having safe and law-abiding bondsmen supported the court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The insurance agency retroactively applied a new law, which was lawful when clear legislative intent was that the law be applied retroactively. The insurance agency did not retrospectively apply the new law since the bail bondsmen had no vested rights in their licenses. Nor did the bail bondsmen have property rights in the licenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of the decision of the District Court, Moffat County (Colorado) that convicted him of first degree murder and sentenced him to the mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 40 years, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(1)(a)(IV), 8B (1986 &amp; 1989 Supp.) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-103, 8A (1986 &amp; 1989 Supp.).</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-110, 8A (1990), to refuse to admit character evidence regarding the victim, and to impose an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentence. The court affirmed the conviction. The court concluded that &sect; 16-10-110 did not infringe on defendant's fundamental right to a fair trial because it merely informed the jury that they would not be asked to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed. Because defendant did not raise a claim of self-defense, the court concluded that character evidence concerning the victim's prior violent and abusive tendencies was inadmissible. The court held that the appropriate review of defendant's claim, that his sentence was an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentence because he was a 20 year-old with no prior felony record, was a comparison of the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty. Applying this review, the court found that the punishment was not disproportionate, and did not violate the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the actus reus of felony menacing was not equivalent to the actus reus of the offense of disorderly conduct with a deadly weapon under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-106(1)(f) (1986) because each offense required an actus reus that was sufficiently distinguishable so that it was valid to charge defendants with either crime if the elements of each crime was satisfied. The court also opined that felony menacing necessarily involved placing another person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury by the use of a deadly weapon and that precedent specifically stated that the phrase &quot;calculated to alarm&quot; in the disorderly conduct statute was broader than the felony menacing statute's requirement of placing another person in fear of serious imminent bodily injury by use of a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court rejected defendant's challenges to the constitutionality of &sect; 18-8-406, holding that a readily ascertainable standard by which the conduct of a public servant, authorized by law to perform particular acts, could be measured. The court concluded that defendant failed to carry his burden of establishing, beyond a reasonable doubt, that &sect; 18-8-406 was either vague or overbroad. The court then noted that a sheriff cannot fully perform his functions without the implied power to make official certificates and, as such, he was authorized by law to make and issue official certificates, falling within the prohibition of the statute.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-1 et seq. (1988 &amp; Supp. 1992), for inverse condemnation arising out of damage to the company's building that was allegedly caused by water leaking from the city's storage tanks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that the company had not shown that there was a triable issue of fact in its claim for inverse condemnation, and did not show any evidence that the city intended to act, or refused to act, in such a way that the natural consequence of its acts would result in a taking of the company's building because the city's water saturated the soil beneath that building. The court found that the trial court neither followed the proper procedure nor employed the proper legal test for determining whether the company's notice to the city, pursuant to the GIA, was timely. Because there was a factual dispute concerning when the company discovered its injury, summary judgment under Colo. R. Civ. P. 56 was error. The matter should have been treated as a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Colo. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) because unless the company complied with the notice requirement, sovereign immunity barred the suit for tort injury. The notice requirement was not facially unconstitutional and the company had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that it was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, Secretary of State and local election officer, sought relief from the order of the District Court, Boulder County (Colorado), which awarded injunctive and declaratory relief to plaintiffs, voters and candidate, in plaintiffs' action that challenged the method by which write-in ballots were counted. Plaintiffs asserted that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-7-309(3) and 1-7-507(1)(e) had to be construed to give effect to the voter's intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, voters and candidate, sought an order to enjoin the certification of election results and a declaration that Colo.

The court affirmed the order of the district court that awarded relief to plaintiffs and reversed as to the breadth of that award. The court held that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the controversy and that the issues presented in the controversy were justiciable. The court ruled that neither Colo. Const. art. VII, &sect; 12 nor Colo. art. V, &sect; 10, barred the district court from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over the controversy. The court determined that a rule of strict compliance would cause Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-7-309(3) and 1-7-507(1)(e) to unreasonably burden a voter's right to cast a vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city hired an engineer to drill core holes upon land that the mineral lessee had right to explore for coal. A 600-foot core hole showed that there were no commercial coal reserves. The City subsequently purchased the property where it constructed a wastewater reservoir. The mineral lessee filed an inverse condemnation action against the city. The trial court determined that a taking had occurred and a jury awarded the mineral lessee damages. On certification to the Colorado Supreme Court, the mineral lessee claimed that the city took his property by exerting control over the surface estate, and by publishing the results of core hole. The court rejected the mineral lessee's claims. The court ruled that the city's purchase of the property provided the city with a bundle of rights, which included the mineral lessee's duty to provide support and that the mineral lessee did not lose any rights by the acquisition. The court further found that the mineral lessee was not prevented from exploring or mining coal lying under the site, and that publication of the core results did not present information that was not available in other public information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the mineral lessee.

The lessees failed to pay the taxes to the Colorado Department of Revenue (department) and the department seized equipment, fixtures, and miscellaneous possessions on the premises to satisfy the delinquent taxes. The property owner filed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the statutory provisions; specifically, it was asserted that Colo. Rev.

II, &sect; 25 as well as the Taking Clauses of both the state and federal constitutions. The trial court rejected the challenges and entered summary judgment in favor of the department.

The court affirmed the district court judgment that upheld the municipal court decision made on the basis that the Ordinance failed to provide particularized standards for determining what conduct constituted harassment. The court held that the Ordinance was unconstitutionally vague under the Colorado Constitution and therefore the court did not decide if it was constitutional under the United States Constitution. The court rejected the state's contention that the Ordinance did not violate due process standards because its subsections failed to specifically define the prohibited conduct. The court rejected the state's contention that the Ordinance did not violate the ex-husband's due process rights because it did not focus on both his intent as well as on the actual effect of the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant had not suffered any prejudice by the ministerial defect of the lack of the affiant's name on the warrant. The court determined that the motion to suppress was improperly granted because the warrant met constitutional requirements and did not offend any substantive policy designed to protect defendant's rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sold cocaine to an undercover informant. Later, searching defendant's residence under a search warrant, police seized more cocaine from the home and from his parked vehicle. He pled guilty to two counts of possession and sale of cocaine. The trial court continued the case for consideration of issues raised by him as to the statutory requirement of revocation of his driver's license. He moved for a declaration that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-122(1)(1) was unconstitutional because it constituted a taking of a protected property interest without a reasonable relationship to public health, safety or welfare, and without a nexus between the offense committed and the act of driving. The trial court granted the motion, concluding that the sanction had no reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, and welfare if the defendant's use, operation, or possession of a motor vehicle was not directly related to the commission of the offense. The court reversed, finding that the sanction was reasonably related to the governmental objective of preventing the possession, use, or sale of controlled substances, as a deterrent from committing offenses involving controlled substances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant state sought certiorari to the Colorado Court of Appeals challenging the appellate court's holding that the legislature's repeal and reenactment of the Criminal Justice Records Act unconstitutionally eliminated on a retroactive basis a prior vested right of respondent convicted persons to petition the courts to seal their criminal records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent convicted criminals, each of whom pleaded guilty to their crimes, petitioned to have their conviction records sealed. The trial court denied the petitions on the basis that the Criminal Justice Records Act (Act), as amended, permitted sealing only if a criminal case was dismissed or the individual was acquitted. The appellate court reversed, holding that the legislature's repeal and reenactment of the Act violated the constitutional prohibition against retroactive application of statutes because it eliminated respondent's prior vested right to petition the court for an order sealing their criminal records. The court reversed and held that respondents had no vested right to petition the courts for such an order because respondents' interest was based not on the federal or state constitutions, but solely on the statute. Accordingly, retroactive application of the statute implicated no constitutional or other fundamental right. Further, the fact that respondents acquired criminal records before revision of the statute did not mean that they were exempt from application of the revised statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgments of the court of appeals and remanded the cases with directions to affirm the judgments of the district courts because the retroactive application of the amended Criminal Justice Records Act (Act) did not unconstitutionally deprive respondent convicted criminals of a fundamental right where it did nothing more than take away respondents' unexercised opportunity to seek relief from the courts under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for the City and County of Denver (Colorado) granted a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant, the Colorado Department of Social Services.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At one time or another, each named party had been listed as a perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a child under the provisions of the Child Protection Act of 1987 (Act), Colo.

V and XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, and requesting an injunction prohibiting enforcement by the Director of the Colorado Department of Social Services (department). The trial court granted the department's motion for summary judgment, concluding that no constitutionally cognizable property interests had been established. The trial court also determined that the Act did not unduly restrict protected liberty interests and that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed, holding that the state's interest in protecting children was sufficiently significant to justify the absence of any adversary proceeding prior to the filing of a confirmed report in view of all of the procedural safeguards already contained in the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because the provisions of the suspected child abuser registry statute neither denied constitutional due process of law nor were vague.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1501.5 (1984) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with &quot;driving after revocation prohibited&quot; and the district court dismissed the charge on the grounds that defendant's prior conviction for driving while impaired was obtained in violation of his constitutional right to counsel, and that &sect; 42-4-1501.5 violated due process and federal and state prohibitions against ex post facto laws because, among other things, it did not provide a grace period in which a defendant could bring a challenge to a conviction which antedated the time limitation. The court held that judicial construction of another statute could not put defendant on notice that a similar construction of &sect; 42-4-1501.5 was imminent and would provide a grace period in which to bring an out-of-time collateral attack of a prior conviction. However, the court vacated the judgment, holding that the district court, before finding the statute unconstitutional, should have considered the applicability of the &quot;justifiable excuse&quot; exception to &sect; 42-4-1501.5 to justify defendant's failure to collaterally attack his prior conviction. The court remanded the matter with instructions that the district court first resolve that issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested after a warrantless search of his car during a routine traffic stop. He was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, driving without insurance, and possession of paraphernalia. Defendant moved to suppress drug paraphernalia, statements, drugs found in the car, and a post-arrest confession. The district court granted the motion to suppress in part, and the state appealed. The state contended defendant knowingly consented to the search. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Once the defendant was free to go, he nevertheless engaged in a consensual interview and consented to a pat-down when the pot pipe was found, rendering it admissible at trial. Incriminating statements made thereafter, however, were properly suppressed by the trial court. At that point, defendant was in custody and had not been given his Miranda rights. Further findings were required, however, to determine whether the prior consensual consent, given before the pat down, remained invalid at the later point when defendant was taken into custody and the car search uncovered drugs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The People appealed a ruling of the Gilpin County District Court (Colorado), which precluded the death penalty from consideration at the trial of defendants, ruling that Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-11-801 and 16-11-802, could not be applied to the death penalty because such application would violate the ex post facto clause of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11, and that a pre-1988 death penalty statute was not revived by a prior holding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state's pre-1988 death penalty sentencing statute had been found unconstitutional because it eliminated the fourth step of the jury's deliberation process in determining whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment or death upon conviction for a class 1 felony. One month after the decision, defendants were charged with several felonies, including first degree murder. After the commission of the charged offenses, the general assembly repealed and reenacted the death penalty sentencing statute, again making the death penalty available as a sentence for persons convicted of class 1 felony offenses committed after September 20, 1991. The court found that the district court properly determined that the death penalty could not be sought against defendants under the pre-1988 statute, because at the time of the offenses, there was no valid death penalty sentencing statute in effect. Applying the reenacted statute retroactively would inflict a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed, thus violating both the federal and state constitutional proscriptions against ex post facto laws, because the maximum penalty at that time was life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court, which held that the state was precluded from seeking the death penalty in defendant's trial for a class 1 felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The school district argued that the strike was illegal because the teachers did not have the right to strike as public employees and that it was entitled to damages for their tortious interference in negotiations with other teachers. The teachers argued that the appeals court erred when it determined that the school district's termination of their employment did not violate their due process rights, and that the school district's failure to follow the procedures of the Teacher Tenure Act, 9 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22-63-101, 22-63-118, was harmless error.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-2-101, 8-1-126 (1986). The strike was lawful, therefore the teachers were not liable in tort to the school district.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-101 (Supp. 1992) was constitutional, and an order directing the district court to empanel a jury in two criminal cases. The state contended that two defendants in criminal trials had to obtain the state's consent before waiving the right to trial by jury under &sect; 16-10-101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The defendants sought to waive their rights to trial by jury under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-406(2) (1986). The state refused to consent to the waivers and contended that the refusals required trial by jury under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-101 (Supp. 1992). The district court found that &sect; 16-10-101, which required the state's consent as a prerequisite to such waivers, was unconstitutional. At the state's request, the district court issued a rule to show cause why the district court should not issue a writ of mandamus requiring the district court to empanel a jury in the criminal actions. The court made the rule absolute. The state could not compel a jury trial when an accused's constitutional right to a fair trial, guaranteed by due process, would be violated. When considering &sect; 16-10-101 and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-406(2) (1986) together, the due process guarantee of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, compelled the conclusion that the state alone could not compel a jury trial where the accused might not receive a fair jury trial. In criminal actions, however, there was no clear articulation of due process concerns that would preclude a fair jury trial and require changes in venue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city took possession of a vehicle after it was stopped because it did not have any license plates. An examination of the vehicle revealed that its vehicle identification number had been removed, and it was seized pursuant to 17 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-5-107. The auto dealer filed a replevin action. The city claimed that replevin was a tort claim that was barred by the Governmental Immunity Act (Act), 10A Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-10-101to 24-10-119 (1988), and that the auto dealer failed to provide the notice of claim required by the Act. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and held that notice was a condition precedent under the Act and that it did not have jurisdiction over a replevin tort claim. The court granted certiorari to determine whether the replevin claim was barred by the Act because it sounded in tort or it could lie in tort. The court reversed the court of appeals' finding because the facts surrounding the claim did sound in tort, and the auto dealer failed to give the requisite notice of claim. The constitutional issue was not considered because it was not raised in the district court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wife filed a negligence action against the husband and the driver of another vehicle after she was injured in an accident in which they were involved. The insurer filed a declaratory judgment action against the insureds to determine whether the wife's negligence claim was covered under their policy, which contained a household exclusion clause. The district court determined that the statute authorizing household exclusion clauses was consistent with equal protection requirements and granted summary judgment for the insurer. The court of appeals affirmed, but declined to review the equal protection issue for lack of jurisdiction. The court granted certiorari and applied a rational basis test in affirming the district court's judgment for the insurer. Neither the statute nor the household exclusion clause adversely affected the fundamental right to travel in a constitutionally significant sense. To the extent that the household exclusion clause denied the insureds a certain type of automobile insurance coverage, the clause did so in a fashion that did not affect their access to basic necessities and did not impermissibly inhibit their right to travel within and between states.</SPAN></P>

Several months after the charges arose, the state supreme court held that the existing death penalty statute was unconstitutional. Defendant argued that the death penalty statute existing at the time of the incident could not be revived and that a later death penalty statute could not be retroactively applied to him. The court affirmed the ruling that revival of the existing statute could not occur. The court reversed the ruling that retroactive application of the later death penalty statute would not violate the constitutional proscription against ex post facto laws. The court also affirmed the ruling that defendant would be eligible for parole after 40 years if life imprisonment was imposed as a penalty. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 16-11-801 and -802 both addressed the issue of parole. Because the statutes were conflicting, the court could not simultaneously give effect to both provisions and had to avoid a construction which would retroactively apply a statute in violation of the ex post facto clause. Therefore, the statute which was latest in its effective date, &sect; 16-11-802, prevailed.</SPAN></P>

The assessment was based on an estimate derived from a list of the roofing company's projects in the city. The roofing company requested an administrative hearing before the manager in order to contest the use tax assessment. The manager found that the roofing company failed to meet its burden of proving the unconstitutionality of the challenged ordinance. The district court affirmed and the court affirmed.

Stat. &sect; 18-4-406 (1986) violated her right to due process of law by eliminating the prosecution's burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the element of intent essential for conviction of the offense of theft. The court reversed the order of the trial court. The court held that &sect; 18-4-406 did not violate due process standards because the evidentiary presumption was a permissive presumption and did not alter the state's burden of persuasion with respect to the element of intent to commit theft. The court held that in view of the basic principle that a statute susceptible to different interpretations should be construed in a manner consistent with constitutional principles when reasonable to do so, the reference to &quot;prima facie evidence&quot; contained in &sect; 18-4-406, established a permissive inference permitting but not requiring the finder of fact to find from evidence of willful concealment that the accused intended to steal the merchandise concealed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the district court's order and reinstated the PUC's decision. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the proceeding was quasi-judicial in nature because identifiable parties existed, no new rule of general application resulted, and notice and public hearing were required; (2) the county had standing because it had suffered injury in fact to a legally protected interest; and (3) &sect; 30-28-127 did not violate the county's due process rights because it contained sufficiently definite standards, which could be uniformly applied to control the PUC's exercise of administrative discretion, if read in the context of the statutory scheme that covered county planning along with the PUC's rules.

The weapon was a screwdriver that the defendant had used to threaten police officers with during a traffic stop.

On appeal, the court reversed because &sect; 18-12-108 when properly construed was consistent with constitutional requirements. It was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and the legislature had not exceeded its police power. The court focused on the fact that alleged statutory offense was a specific intent crime, which required a knowing use of the screwdriver as a weapon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, citizen committee and circulator, filed an action that challenged appellee Secretary of State's (Secretary) final decision that rejected petitions of citizen signatures submitted in support of a legislative initiative, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-40-106, 1-40-107, and 1-40-109 (1991 Supp.). The District Court for the Second Judicial District of Colorado affirmed. The citizen committee and circulator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Application of the amendments to the citizen committee's initiative activities that occurred prior to the adoption of the amendments did not violate the prohibition against retroactive application of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11. Legislation designed to prevent fraud or other abuses were rooted in Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(2), and Colo. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11. Therefore, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-40-106(2)(b) that required notarization of circulator affidavits by someone with authority to give oaths, and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-40-109(1)(b)(I) and 1-40-106(2)(a) that limited petition signors to only registered electors that gave detailed information about their legal residence did not impermissibly restrict the process or violate Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(6). The invalidation of petitions with extra staple holes was arbitrary and capricious because it raised circumstantial evidence to the level of an evidentiary presumption. It was also overly restrictive to invalidate a circulator's affidavits and corresponding petitions, given the circulator's explanation for the discrepancy in the dates and the lack of notice that such a discrepancy could have caused invalidation of the petitions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed in part the affirmance of the Secretary's final decision with respect to rejection of petitions that contained unexplained staple holes, and that had discrepancies in dates to the corresponding circulator affidavits. The court remanded these issues for further proceedings. The rest of the affirmance was upheld.</SPAN></P>

Noting that defendant was on parole and probation status at the time of the offense, the trial court held that a sentence in the mandatory aggravated range was required pursuant &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a), and imposed a 10 year sentence. Defendant contended that he was entitled to the benefit of the 1988 amendment to &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a), which could have reduced his sentence to five years. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment that the 1988 amendment was not applicable to defendant's sentencing proceedings. The court found the new sentencing provisions were applicable only to acts committed on or after July 1, 1988, and adoption of defendant's argument would require the court to ignore the clear legislative determination that the such amendments were intended to have prospective application only. Also, the court found no indication in the language and structure of the 1988 amendments to justify a conclusion that the ameliorative sentence reduction benefits were intended to apply to persons, such as defendant, sentenced in the aggravated range.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant state employees sought a declaratory judgment against appellee state in its challenge to the state's maximum salary level. Appellant's complaint alleged, inter alia, that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-50-104 (6) (1988), establishing a maximum monthly salary level payable to the employees, violated Colo. Const. art. XII, &sect; 13, 14, 15 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court granted summary judgment on behalf of appellee. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed the decision holding that the statute did not unconstitutionally transfer legislative authority of appropriation to the state personnel director. The state constitution granted to the general assembly primary responsibility for determining the amount of revenue to be expended in the state. To construe the section as authorizing the state personnel director to control the appropriation process as it is impacted by classification and reclassification of state employees would alter the check and balance system of governmental fiscal responsibility. When construed as a whole, the section prohibited the director from developing pay plans compensating state employees in excess of levels established by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was a psychotherapist who had sexual intercourse with a client. Defendant was convicted of four counts of aggravated sexual assault. Defendant brought a motion for a judgment of acquittal on the basis that Colo. Rev.

The court found that neither defendant nor his client had a fundamental right to engage in sexual intercourse during the therapeutic relationship, so that &sect; 18-3-405.5 was not subject to an overbreadth analysis but instead was reviewed under a rational basis standard. Under such standard, &sect; 18-3-405.5 satisfied due process, because the state had a legitimate interest in protecting psychotherapy clients from sexual exploitation, and prohibiting sexual penetration by a psychotherapist was reasonably related to such interest. Section 18-3-405.5 did not violate defendant's equal protection rights, because under the rational basis standard the special nature of psychotherapy was a reasonable basis for limiting the statutory scope to the psychotherapeutic relationship and not including other healthcare relationships.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimants brought tort claims and claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against third-party defendants, state departments and employees, based on injuries suffered when a state vehicle caused a boulder to collide with a tour bus. Plaintiff state filed an interpleader action and attempted to have a defendant class certified. Defendants filed for summary judgment, asserting that Colo. Rev. Stat. tit. 10A, &sect; 24-10-114(1) (1988), which limited state liability to $ 400,000, violated their equal protection and due process rights. The district court ruled against defendants. On appeal, the court determined that the statute did not violate equal protection rights. The statute was subject to a rational basis test, and plaintiff had a legitimate interest in creating fiscal certainty in order to execute its myriad public responsibilities. Because there was no right to a remedy, defendants failed to articulate a cognizable property interest in support of their due process claim. However, the court was not convinced that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to defendants' &sect; 1983 allegations, and these claims were reinstated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The statute served plaintiff's legitimate interest in fiscal certainty, and defendants raised no property interest in support of their due process claim. Civil rights claims against third-party defendants, state departments and employees, were reinstated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the &quot;percent by weight&quot; provision in Colo. Rev. Stat. 18-3-106, 8B (1986) was facially vague. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court determined that there was an incongruity between the &quot;percent by weight&quot; language of the statute and the &quot;weight per volume&quot; tests actually used. Because the court found that the legislative intent of the &quot;percent by weight&quot; test was the &quot;weight per volume&quot; test and that the &quot;percent by weight&quot; language permissibly could mean the &quot;weight per volume&quot; test for due process purposes, the court concluded that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the facility was charged with a criminal misdemeanor for operating a massage parlor without a valid license, it sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that Colo.

After a hearing on the preliminary injunction, the district court denied the relief requested and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court found no merit in the facility's void-for-vagueness challenge and held that the terms &quot;massage&quot; and &quot;massage parlor&quot; were sufficiently specific so that persons of ordinary intelligence could distinguish between permissible and illegal conduct. Further, for purposes of equal protection analysis, the facility could not claim a fundamental right to operate a commercial massage parlor. Also, the government had a legitimate interest not only in regulating various forms of conduct which could adversely affect public health but also in prohibiting various forms of unlawful sexual conduct, including prostitution.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Mun. Code &sect; 8-55 (1989), was unconstitutional. The District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado) construed the ordinance and held it constitutional. The dog owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the ordinance did not violate procedural due process, because: 1) the trial court's modification, which placed the burden upon the city to show that a breed in dispute was a pit bull, was proper; 2) the city's burden of proof in civil or regulatory proceedings under the ordinance was the preponderance of the evidence standard, and; 3) in criminal proceedings, the city was required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The ordinance did not violate substantive due process, even though it: 1) permitted establishment of the dog's breed by expert and non-scientific evidence, and; 2) did not include all violent breeds. The ordinance was not vague, because the term &quot;pit bull&quot; was not imprecise and AKC and UKC standards were readily ascertainable. The ordinance did not violate equal protection because: 1) it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest, and 2) the trial court's modification, eliminating the distinction between previously licensed and previously unlicensed owners, was proper. The ordinance was not a taking because pit bulls could have been kept as long as they were licensed, and other minimum standards met.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that Denver, Colo., Municipal Code &sect;&sect; 53-56, 53-124, did not supersede a state statute regarding appellate procedures governing contested sales and use taxes in Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an assessment of use taxes by defendant, City and County of Denver, regarding plaintiff's use of preprinted advertising inserts distributed with the local newspapers.

Stat. &sect; 29-2-106.1 governed appeals taken from locally imposed use and sales taxes. The court held that &sect; 29-2-106.1 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because the revenue manager's hearing and determination were quasi-judicial in nature and susceptible to de novo review in the district court. The court found that the revenue manager's determination did not affect any party other than plaintiff and that it had no prospective, general application.

The district courts found, among other things, no constitutional infirmity in either case. The repairmen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court held that the term &quot;store&quot; should be given its ordinary meaning. According to the dictionary, the term meant, among other things, to accumulate, to collect, or lay away. These definitions were not inaccessible to a common intelligence. Additionally, the court held that the code provision included other terms, including &quot;pile&quot; and &quot;allow to accumulate,&quot; which gave the term &quot;store&quot; meaning. The court affirmed the judgments of the two district courts, holding that &sect; 9.82.040, thus, provided fair warning of the conduct prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant Secretary of State of Colorado denied ballot access to a Libertarian gubernatorial candidate because the candidate was registered as a Republican.

The trial court held that the challenged provision was constitutional, and the Libertarian party and candidate sought review. On appeal, the court ruled that the unaffiliation requirement in the statute did not violate the right to political association or the right to equal protection of the laws. The court also held that the statute's dissimilar treatment was permissible under the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Certiorari was granted to review the decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals that affirmed the lower court's summary judgment decision denying petitioner political advocates access to the open spaces in respondent shopping mall for the peaceful distribution of political literature and the collection of signatures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent shopping mall operated a center that included over 130 retail outlets, plus significant common area space. Respondent did not allow petitioner political advocates to distribute pamphlets and collect protest signatures in the common areas inside the mall. The lower court granted summary judgment to respondent in petitioners' action for declaratory and injunctive relief and the court of appeals affirmed. The court reversed and held that Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 afforded a broader protection to freedom of speech than U.S. Const. amend. I. Applying only the Colorado Constitution, the court held that where respondent had received tax incentives from the government, maintained a police station within the mall, and actively encouraged government entities such as the armed forces to make presentations at the mall, there was a sufficient showing of public involvement in the mall to warrant a finding that respondent was affected with a public interest. Additionally respondent performed a vital public function. Accordingly, respondent's denial of petitioners' rights to distribute political pamphlets and collect signatures violated Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals that had affirmed summary judgment for respondent shopping mall in petitioner political advocates' action for declaratory and injunctive relief. The court ordered that summary judgment be entered for petitioners. Respondent's refusal to allow petitioners to distribute political pamphlets and solicit petition signatures violated the free speech provisions of the Colorado Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of a decision by the District Court, Pueblo County (Colorado), which denied him an evidentiary hearing to challenge his rejection by a privately-operated community corrections facility after a judgment in favor of the state convicting defendant of attempt to possess a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pled guilty to attempt to possess a controlled substance pursuant to a plea agreement that provided that he would be sentenced to a community corrections facility. The private facility revoked its acceptance of defendant, and he was transferred to a county jail pending resentencing. Defendant filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing, claiming that allowing a court to resentence him without an evidentiary hearing was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion and sentenced defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that defendant's due process rights were not violated. Defendant had no justifiable expectation that he would remain at the facility because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-27-103(3) (Supp. 1990) stated that the sentencing court was not required to provide an evidentiary hearing prior to resentencing. The court stated that defendant had no liberty interest in remaining at the facility and was thus not entitled to due process protections. The court held that there was no violation of equal protection because defendant did not show that other offenders who committed similar offenses were entitled to hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the order of the trial court denying defendant an evidentiary hearing prior to resentencing for his conviction for attempt to possess a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
