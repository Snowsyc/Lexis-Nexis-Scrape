<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment and sentence of the Circuit Court in and for Sarasota County (Florida), which imposed the death penalty after trial on charges of first-degree murder and armed burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions for first-degree murder and armed burglary, and he also challenged the imposition of the death penalty. Appellant raised numerous errors, including that the arrest warrant was defective and his confessions should have been suppressed. The court held that the omissions from the affidavit in question were not material because they could not possibly have altered the probable cause finding. All of the omissions were de minimis at best and in no sense vitiated probable cause. The court found that the arrest, at a minimum, was supported by probable cause under the fellow-officer rule and that appellant's statements and confession were lawful. The court held that appellant's statement that he would rather receive a shot than die in the electric chair was made voluntarily and spontaneously, not as part of custodial interrogation. Accordingly, there was no error in the failure to suppress it. Further, the court found that appellant's confession elaborating details of the murder and identifying the location of a murder weapon was properly admitted because appellant had fully waived his right to be represented by counsel at the time of the confession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's first-degree murder and armed burglary convictions, as well as the sentences imposed. The court held that omissions from the probable cause affidavit for the arrest warrant were immaterial and did not vitiate probable cause. Further, there was no suggestion of reckless or intentional disregard of the truth. The court also held that all the confessions made by appellant were lawful and not subject to suppression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his brother were charged with the murders of two women. The jury found appellant guilty of the first-degree murder and robbery. A penalty phase proceeding was conducted, and the jury returned a recommendation for the death penalty. Subsequent to the penalty phase proceeding, the trial judge discovered that the jury had not been given separate jury forms to enable it to make separate recommendations as to each of the murders. The parties stipulated that the jury's recommendation would be accepted as one of death for one murder and one of life imprisonment for the other. Before appellant was sentenced, however, he attempted to withdraw his consent to the stipulation, but the trial judge refused to allow him to do so. On appeal, appellant raised five issues regarding the guilt phase and 12 issues regarding the penalty phase. However, the court affirmed the convictions for robbery and murder, but reversed his sentences for the murder convictions. In reversing the sentences, the court found that the trial judge should have granted appellant's request to withdraw under the liberal standard used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a minor, sought review of the decision from the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) that reversed the order of the trial court granting petitioner's motion to dismiss the petition charging him with unlawful carnal intercourse with a minor in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.05 (1991), and that certified the question of whether that statute violated the privacy provision of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a 16-year-old minor, was charged with unlawful carnal intercourse with a 16-year-old minor in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.05 (1991). The trial court found that the statute violated petitioner's state constitutional privacy rights and granted petitioner's motion to dismiss the delinquency petition. The appellate court reversed the dismissal. Upon certification on the question of the constitutionality of the statute, the court held that petitioner's status as a minor did not deprive him of his privacy rights under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The court held that because the purpose of &sect; 794.05 was to further the state's compelling interest in protecting minors from sexual exploitation by adults, it was not facially unconstitutional. However because the state's interest in a minor-minor sexual situation was to protect the health and quality of life of the minors, and because &sect; 794.05 was not the least intrusive means of furthering that interest, the statute was unconstitutional as applied to petitioner. Therefore, the court quashed the decision and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for first degree murder and the imposition of the death sentence. The trial court denied appellant's motion in limine to exclude evidence of a collateral similar crime under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.404(2)(a) (1993), which the state introduced at trial. The court held that this error was not harmless because the facts were dissimilar. The trial court, despite appellant's objection, admitted DNA evidence. The court held that the evidence should be excluded, because the testing laboratory had admitted unreliable procedures. The trial court allowed, over appellant's objection, the state's witness to testify about the victim's statement and to assert that appellant committed the crime. The court decided that this was an error. Appellant claimed that the trial court improperly allowed, contrary to his objection, the state to attempt to transfer the burden of proof for testing evidence. The court determined that this was error. The court reversed the first degree murder conviction, vacated the death sentence, and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

V, &sect; 3(b)(1), defendant appealed both his conviction for first degree murder and his sentence of death from the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida). In giving the death sentence, the trial court found one aggravator and no statutory mitigators, and gave little or no weight to three nonstatutory mitigators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted of first degree murder from a premeditated design and was sentenced to death by the trial court when it found one aggravator and no statutory mitigators and gave little or no weight to three nonstatutory mitigators. The appellate court affirmed the conviction because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony, after it properly made an adequate inquiry into whether there was a violation of the discovery rules. In addition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance when defendant's trial counsel resigned from the public defender's office a month before the trial began. As to the sentencing phase, the appellate court concluded that the death sentence had to be reversed because the imposition of such a sentence was not proportionate. The aggravator and mitigators in the instant case were similar to those in another case reviewed by the court where the death penalty was vacated, and it have been disproportionate to rule otherwise in this case. The death penalty sentence was vacated and reduced to life in prison.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court imposed the death penalty, defendant appealed. On appeal, the court did not find that the court abused its discretion in admitting testimony which was relevant to the issue of premeditation. The court affirmed defendant's convictions but vacated his death sentence and remanded for a new penalty phase proceeding because a jury instruction on aggravating circumstances was unconstitutionally vague, the court could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that errors were harmless, and the court could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The court agreed with defendant that the aggravating factors of avoiding arrest/hindering enforcement of laws and murder of a law enforcement officer were duplicative because both factors were based on a single aspect of the offense, that the victim was a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the state of Florida, challenged a decision of the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) that affirmed a trial court's decision that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 876.18 (1993), which prohibited erecting a flaming cross on the property of another, violated U.S. Const. amend. I. Appellant claimed that the statute was constitutional because the prohibited activity was a threat of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a minor, was charged with erecting a flaming cross on the property of another in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 876.18 (1993). Appellee claimed that the statute on its face violated U.S. Const. amend. I because it was a content-based statute prohibiting expressive conduct. The trial court held the statute unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed. Appellant, the state of Florida, challenged the ruling on the ground that the statute was constitutional. The state supreme court reversed the lower courts' rulings and held the statute constitutional as proscribing threats of violence. An unauthorized cross-burning by intruders in one's own yard constituted a direct threat to one's security, inflicted injury in the form of fear and intimidation, and tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. Threats of violence were not protected by the first amendment and the state of Florida had a compelling interest in protecting the right of its citizens to be free from violence or the threat of violence, so the statute was constitutional. Because the full range of conduct that the statute addressed was proscribable as a threat of violence, the statute was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed an appellate court decision that affirmed the trial court's decision that a statute that banned erecting a flaming cross on the property of another violated U.S. Const. amend I. The supreme court held that the statute was constitutional because erecting a flaming cross on the property of another amounted to a threat of violence, and threats of violence were not protected speech under the first amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Presenter, the Florida Attorney General, requested an advisory opinion from the Supreme Court of Florida about a ballot initiative petition circulated by supporters, a gaming organization, to amend the Florida Constitution by authorizing casino gaming. Opposition, an anti-gaming organization and Florida's governor and cabinet, raised issues of compliance with Fla. Stat. ch. 101.161(1) (1993) and Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Presenter, Florida Attorney General, requested an advisory opinion from the court on the ballot initiative petition circulated by supporters, a gaming organization, to amend Florida's Constitution to allow casinos. Opposition, an anti-gaming organization, Florida governor and cabinet, challenged the petition and proposed amendment's compliance. Opposition argued that the ballot's title and summary was unclear and misleading contrary to Fla. Stat. ch. 101.161(1) (1993). Opposition questioned whether the amendment contained just one subject under Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. The court found the ballot's title and summary misleading in three respects. Although the petition led voters to believe casinos will be operated only in hotels, the amendment permitted casinos in a variety of facilities. While the petition led voters to believe that casinos would exist on functioning ships, the amendment allowed casinos on stationary vessels. The petition's initial language led voters to believe the amendment would prohibit casinos and misled by not stating gaming was already prohibited. The court held fatal defects prohibited the ballot initiative and did not reach the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued an advisory opinion as requested by presenter Florida Attorney General, which agreed with opposition anti-gaming organization and Florida governor and cabinet, because the ballot initiative petition circulated by supporters, a gaming organization, was misleading. Therefore, the court ruled that supporters' proposed amendment to allow casino gaming would not be placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit certified a question for review concerning the applicability of Fla. Stat. ch. 768.73 to an arbitration award granted in favor of plaintiff investors in their action against defendant investment company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant investment company refused to reimburse plaintiff investors for substantial losses incurred on an investment account, plaintiffs filed a demand for arbitration pursuant to the parties' contract. Plaintiffs were awarded both compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs filed a petition in district court seeking to have the award confirmed. Defendant forwarded two checks to plaintiffs, including one made out to a state general revenue fund for a percentage of the punitive damage award pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.73. After plaintiffs moved again for an order confirming the award, the district court held that the statute applied to arbitration awards. Plaintiffs appealed, but the appellate court reserved consideration of issues until a state court determined whether the statute applied. The court held that a civil action, as referred to in Fla. Stat. ch. 768.73, clearly referred to an action filed in a court within the state and did not include an arbitration proceeding. Therefore, the statute did not apply to plaintiffs' arbitration award of punitive damages. The case was returned to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state statute that required payment of a percentage of punitive damages to a general revenue fund applied to civil actions filed with a court and, thus, was inapplicable to plaintiff investors' arbitration award of punitive damages from defendant investment company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Lake County (Florida) that sentenced appellant to death for first-degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant murdered his landlord by striking him several times in the head with a claw hammer and choking him with a cord. The jury found appellant guilty of first-degree murder, and the trial court found, as an aggravating factor, that the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated. The court sentenced appellant to death. Appellant sought review of the decision and alleged that the lower court erroneously found that the crime was cold, calculated, and premeditated and that his death sentence was disproportionate and excessive. Appellee state asserted that the lower court erred in prohibiting appellee from introducing in the penalty phase certain testimony and evidence. The supreme court affirmed appellant's conviction and death sentence. The court found that the trial court's decision was completely supported by the evidence, and testimony showed the murder was cold, calculated, and premeditated. The court concluded that appellant was procedurally barred from making the argument that the jury recommendation of death was unreliable due to an inadequate jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the appellant's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder and held that the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravating factor was applicable. The court also found that appellant's argument that the lower court's cold, calculated, and premeditated jury instruction was unreliable was procedurally barred because he failed to raise the argument on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The circumstances surrounding the death of the victim did not support premeditation. Without sufficient evidence to support premeditated murder or felony murder, the court had to reverse appellant's conviction of first-degree murder. Instead, the court found the evidence supported a conviction of second-degree murder. The court also reversed the convictions and sentences for attempted sexual battery and kidnapping because it found the trial court erred in denying appellant's motions for judgment of acquittal for kidnapping because there was insufficient evidence to support the crime. The evidence did not rise to the level of an overt act under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(1)(h) toward the commission of a sexual battery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a homeless man who was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and robbery and sentenced to death. Appellant left a bus after a confrontation with the driver. He later returned to the bus and shot the driver and two other people who posed no threat to him. Appellant challenged his convictions and sentences, raising 28 issues on appeal. The court affirmed the convictions and life sentences for robbery and attempted murder, but vacated the death sentence as disproportionate under Florida caselaw. The court struck the cold, calculated and premeditated circumstance, because there was insufficient evidence in the record to prove this factor beyond a reasonable doubt. This left a single aggravating factor--the commission of another capital offense or felony involving use or threat of violence. The death penalty was reserved for the least mitigated and most aggravated of murders. Appellant's case involved vast mitigation including no significant history of criminal activity, the crimes were committed while he was under great mental or emotional disturbance, a badly deprived and unstable childhood, good character, and a history of alcohol and drug abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed all of appellant's convictions and his life sentences on the robbery and attempted murder charges, but vacated his death sentences as disproportionate, and remanded for imposition of life sentences without the possibility of parole for 25 years on the murder counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision from the District Court of Appeal, Fifth District (Florida), challenging the constitutionality of the stalking statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 784.048, as overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with aggravated stalking in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 784.048(4). He unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the charge, claiming the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, and then pled nolo contendere. The district court upheld the statute and petitioner appealed, asking that the district court opinion be quashed. The court found that stalking, whether by word or deed, fell outside the U. S. Const. amend. I's purview. The statute proscribed a particular type of criminal conduct which was defined at length in the statute and expressly provided that constitutionally protected activity was not included within the meaning of &quot;course of conduct.&quot; The statute provided that the perpetrator had to made a credible threat with the intent to place the victim in reasonable fear of death or bodily harm. Since statute created a reasonable person standard, it was not unconstitutionally vague. Thus, the statute was found to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the stalking statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague as it clearly defined the proscribed activity and established a reasonable person standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a gay male who sought to adopt a special needs child.

Petitioner sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and argued that the statute violated equal protection, due process, and the right to privacy as guaranteed by the Florida Constitution. The trial court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional, and respondent appealed. The intermediate court reversed. The appellate court affirmed and held that the record was insufficient to determine that the statute was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 based on the rational-basis standard of review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the validity of an adoption statute that contained a homosexual exclusion because the court found that the trial court did not have a sufficient record to support a summary judgment in favor of petitioner, a homosexual, on any issue. The court further found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. Although the court held that it could not affirm the cold, calculated, and premeditated finding with respect to two of the murders for which appellant was convicted, the existence of the one aggravator of the conviction of two other capital offenses and one violent felony against a person in each instance was sufficient to outweigh the little weight given to the mitigating factors set forth in the sentencing order.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court properly granted respondent's motion for additur because &sect; 627.727(10) was to have retroactive application. Petitioner contended that &sect; 627.727(10) could not be applied retroactively and that its motion for directed verdict was incorrectly denied because the basis upon which petitioner denied coverage was fairly debatable. The court held that &sect; 627.727(10) could not be applied retroactively because it was, in substance, a penalty. Even if the legislature had expressly stated that a statute was to have retroactive application, the court would refuse to apply a statute retroactively if the statute impaired vested rights, created new obligations or imposed a penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged judgments from the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida), which dismissed appellant's challenges from adverse rulings in unrelated prosecutions of appellees for allowing open house parties in which minors consumed or possessed drugs or alcohol in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 856.015 (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In unrelated cases, appellees were charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 856.015 (1991) by knowingly permitting minors to possess or consume alcohol or drugs on appellees' premises. The appellate court dismissed one appellee's charge and held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The second appellee's charge was dismissed because appellant's challenge was untimely. Appellant challenged the adverse rulings. The court affirmed and reversed in part. Chapter 856.015 was not a model of clarity because its use of the term &quot;reasonable&quot; rendered it susceptible to varying meanings of what actions adults were required to take to ensure that minors did not possess or consume alcohol or drugs on the adults' property. Nonetheless, the court held that lack of clarity alone did not justify invalidating the statute. The court ruled that the statute was not too vague to be enforceable. The court noted that an adult could avoid liability under the statute by terminating the party or taking some other reasonable action to prevent a minor's consumption or possession after learning of it. The dismissal of the charges against the second appellate was affirmed on untimeliness grounds.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute under which appellees were prosecuted was not unconstitutionally vague in its attempt to render an adult liable for knowingly permitting a minor to consume or possess alcohol or drugs on the adult's premises. The appeal as to one appellee was properly dismissed as untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state appealed a trial court decision that validated revenue bonds issued by appellee public body corporation. The bonds involved the investment of state transportation fund earnings. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The appellate court held that the bonds did not violate Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10 because the proposed bonds did not pledge public credit or taxing power. The appellate court found that the bondholders were sufficiently put on notice that appellee's obligation under the bonds was limited to several specifically defined revenue sources, and as such, the bondholders could not compel a levy of taxes to compel payment of bond obligations. Since no public credit was pledged, the fact that the primary beneficiary of the project was a private entity was of no matter. Appellee sufficiently established that a legitimate public purpose would be served by the project financed by the bond proceeds. The Florida Development Finance Corporation Act of 1993, Fla. Stat. ch. 288.9602 et seq. (1993), clearly delineated the public purpose served by the bonds. Such findings were not clearly erroneous and supported the validity of the issued bonds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Stat. ch. 365.16(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with making obscene or harassing telephone calls to a postal service management employee's home. The employee filed a complaint against petitioner and, in a bench trial, the employee testified that over a period of two years he had received approximately 30 similar calls from petitioner. The trial court found petitioner guilty of making obscene or harassing telephone calls in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 365.16(1)(a). The court of appeals affirmed the conviction and sustained the statute against the attack that it was an unconstitutional infringement of the right to free speech. Petitioner sought review of the lower court's decision, and the supreme court affirmed the lower court's decision. The court restricted ch. 365.16 to telephone calls or language that intended to abuse, threaten, or harass. With the restrictions, the court held that ch. 365.16(1)(a) was valid because the statutory provision was not directed at the communication of opinions or ideas but at the conduct of making a telephone call without disclosing the caller's identity, with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass the recipient of the call.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the lower court's decision that entered a conviction against petitioner for making obscene or harassing telephone calls and held that the statute on which the conviction was based was constitutional. The court limited the statute's scope by limiting it to telephone calls in which the caller possessed an intent to abuse, threaten, or harass.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner claimed error in the guilt phase of his trial because no evidence was presented at the 3.850 hearing, that any evidence defense counsel claimed he did not receive and did not otherwise have access to, would have with &quot;reasonable probability&quot; changed the result. Petitioner also argued that the trial court erred in concluding that he was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to investigate and present additional mitigating evidence at sentencing. The court agreed. It concluded that, in view of the substantial mitigating evidence presented at the 3.850 hearing, including the testimony of two mental health experts, the court found that counsel's errors deprived petitioner of a reliable penalty phase. The court affirmed the denial of petitioner's rule 3.850 motion with respect to his conviction, vacated and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding before a jury, and denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a Medicaid recipient, sought a writ of mandamus. Petitioner asserted that the 1994-1995 General Appropriations Act (Act), 1994 Fla. Laws ch. 94-357, &sect; 1A(63), at 2916, and the Implementing Bill, 1994 Fla.

The supreme court noted that it could issue writs of mandamus ordering the expunction of unconstitutional provisions in the Act. The court agreed that the implementing bill could not change or amend existing law on subjects other than the implementation of appropriations acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee newspaper twice published the name of an alleged rape victim and was charged therefor by appellant state of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 794.03 (1989), which mandated criminal sanctions for identifying a victim of a sexual offense in any instrument of mass communication. The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss on the grounds that ch. 794.03 was both facially, and as applied, unconstitutional under both the U.S. Const. amend. I, and Fla. Const. art I, &sect; 4. Appellant state challenged that decision to the district court, which affirmed the dismissal. The court agreed with the district court's opinion that ch. 794.03 failed to pass the strict scrutiny test of constitutional jurisprudence because the statute was not narrowly tailored and did not further a state interest of the highest order. The court found that because the law was overinclusive in scope, it would improperly impose criminal sanctions. The court rejected appellee's arguments to remedy those defects by rewriting the law to include affirmative defenses and adopt curative jury instructions. The district court's ruling to invalidate the law was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder and the attendant death sentences. In the penalty phase, the trial judge found five aggravating circumstances and several mitigating circumstances. The court reversed defendant's convictions, vacated the death sentences, and remanded for further proceedings because the state failed to conduct a Richardson hearing for a discovery violation. The court held that the state committed the discovery violation when it failed to provide the defense with a copy of defendant's palm prints. It explained that the trial court should have conducted a Richardson hearing to determine if the violation prejudiced defendant. The trial court, however, did not conduct such a hearing, finding that defendant's challenge to this discovery violation was untimely. Without the hearing, the court ruled that it was required to reverse the convictions. Even though this guilt phase issue required reversal, the court added that the trial court erred when it overrode the jury's life recommendation because of the presence of reasonable mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions, vacated the death sentences, and remanded for further proceedings because the state failed to conduct a Richardson hearing to determine if the state's violation of discovery rules prejudiced defendant. The court also ruled that the trial court impermissibly overrode the jury's recommendation of life in prison to impose the death penalty because reasonable mitigating factors were present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and other felonies and sentenced to death. The death sentence was reversed and during the remanded sentencing phase, defendant requested the right to make closing arguments, citing Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.250. The state informed the trial court that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.250 governed the right to close in the guilt phase and there was no such right in the penalty phase, and the trial court denied defendant's request. The court reversed defendant's death sentence because Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.780 provided for the right of a defendant to close in the penalty phase. The court rejected the state's argument that the failure to grant defendant's request to close was harmless error because it was well established that the right to close in the guilt phase was reversible error and the policy considerations for protecting the right in the guilt phase were the same. The court also rejected the state's contention that defendant waived this issue because defendant requested his rights under Fla. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile appealed the decision of the District Court of Appeal, Fifth District (Florida), affirming the adjudication of petitioner as delinquent on the ground that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061, the statute under which he was charged with escape, was unconstitutional in that the statute improperly delegated legislative authority to the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services to determine what the crime of juvenile escape was.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile was charged with escape from a juvenile commitment facility in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.061. Petitioner pleaded no contest to the charge, reserving the right to appeal the constitutionality of the statute. Petitioner was adjudicated delinquent and committed to the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS). Petitioner appealed, and the adjudication of delinquency was affirmed. Petitioner again appealed. The supreme court held that ch. 39.061, under which petitioner was adjudicated delinquent, was unconstitutional because it improperly delegated to HRS the legislative authority to define the crime of juvenile escape in violation of the separation of powers, and the legislature's vague delegation of open-ended authority to HRS did not allow for proper notice of what was a prohibited act under the law in violation of due process. Moreover, the finding that ch. 39.061 was unconstitutional effected an automatic revival of its immediate predecessor, ch. 39.112. Finally, petitioner's adjudication was sustained under revived ch. 39.112 because the specifications of the charge alleged all elements necessary under section 39.112.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the statute under which petitioner was adjudicated delinquent was unconstitutional because the legislature delegated unlimited and open-ended power to define the crime of juvenile escape to an administrative agency in violation of the separation of powers and due process protections. However, once the statute was voided, it revived its predecessor, and petitioner's adjudication was sustained under the revived statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's claim that he was denied an impartial jury was unfounded because he failed to demonstrate error in denial of challenges for cause, there was not evidence that a juror had formed an opinion prior to trial, and a juror's statement regarding the heinous crime only referenced the nature of the crime committed. Jurors' questions for witnesses were reviewed by the judge and attorneys and deemed proper prior to the judge presenting them to the witnesses. Appeals to the sympathy of the jury and victim impact statements were objected to by the defense, the court sustained the objections and offered a curative statement, which defendant declined. Defendant was not entitled to a hearing on alleged discovery violations because the expert statements referenced were not written statements and were thus not discoverable. Defendant failed to object to jury instructions, and therefore the issue was not preserved for appeal. Mitigating circumstances were properly weighed, and the court rejected argument regarding the constitutionality of the death sentence. Conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal, Fourth District, Indian River County (Florida), certified the following question as having great public importance: whether Fla. Stat. ch. 732.401(1) (1991), which vested a remainder interest in homestead property in lineal descendants, was unconstitutional when applied to defeat a testator's intent to devise homestead property equally to adult stepchildren as well as adult lineal descendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A married couple purchased real property. The couple's will bequeathed their entire estates to each other. The husband's will also provided that if he outlived his wife, his property would pass to his children and stepchildren, share and share alike. Wife died, and husband remarried. Husband established homestead in the real property and then passed away. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 732.401(1) (1991), husband's surviving spouse received a life estate in the homestead, and husband's lineal descendants received a vested remainder. Petitioners, husband's stepchildren, brought an action alleging that ch. 732.401(1) was unconstitutional because it conflicted with Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(c). The trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the district court affirmed. On review, the court stated that the challenged statute was not meant to be a restraint on the right to devise homestead property. The statute prescribed how property was to descend when not devised as permitted under Florida law or the constitution. Because husband died leaving a surviving spouse, his attempt to devise his homestead failed. Thus, the homestead descended pursuant to ch. 732.401(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 1990 Fla. Laws ch. 90-273, circuit courts were required to establish family law divisions and a commission on family courts made recommendations for implementation of the family divisions. Thereafter, all circuit court were required to submit local rules and administrative orders establishing family divisions and then submit annual reports regarding the status of their respective divisions. Meanwhile, 1994 Fla. Laws ch. 94-134 was enacted, giving criminal courts jurisdiction over violations of domestic violence injunctions, thereby conflicting with the scheme that all family law issues, including domestic violence, be handled by family law divisions, not criminal courts. In submitting their reports, various courts were confused about the effect of Chapter 94-134 and the validity of their local rules and administrative orders. In expressly approving certain local rules and administrative orders, the court ruled that its approval was required. The provision of Fla. R. Judicial Admin. 2.050(b), which allowed issuance of administrative orders without approval, did not apply to the establishment of family divisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local rules and administrative orders establishing family law divisions in each of the circuits were approved, with circuit judges directed to comment on the issue of assigning domestic violence cases, because the divisions were properly established and their implementation was not affected by other administrative rule allowing implementation without approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Alachua County Circuit Court (Florida), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of first-degree murder and armed robbery and imposing sentences of death and life imprisonment, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother were charged with armed robbery and first-degree murder. During opening statements in defendant's trial, the prosecutor said that defendant's brother would be the only one who would tell the jury what happened. His brother testified he shot the victim in the chest and defendant stabbed him in the neck. At defendant's instruction, the brother then shot the victim in the head. The victim's wife testified that he liked to go to bars to talk to people and defendant's cellmate testified defendant said he wanted to escape and kill two witnesses that could tie him to the victim. Defendant was found guilty. While his brother was sentenced to life, defendant was sentenced to death and life imprisonment, after asserting no objections to jury instructions. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that, although the prosecutor's opening statement improperly highlighted defendant's right to remain silent, the error was harmless. Also, it was not improper to admit the testimony of the wife or cellmate. The death sentence was justified given defendant's dominating influence and greater culpability. Objections to jury instructions were waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentences were affirmed because, inter alia, a prosecutor's comment highlighting defendant's right to remain silent was harmless error; evidence of the victim's character was not improperly admitted; testimony that defendant told cellmate that he wanted to escape to kill prosecution witnesses was admissible; and death sentence was appropriate, despite accomplice receiving life sentence, since defendant was more culpable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of three separate murders following no contest pleas. In reviewing her death sentence, the court concluded that appellant's plea was not improper or inconsistent because any colorable claim of self-defense continued to be at issue during the penalty phase. The facts did not support the conclusion that her pleas were improperly accepted. The lower court and her counsel apprised her of, and she understood, the consequences of her plea. Further, appellant's claim that hearsay evidence was improperly admitted during the penalty phase was rejected because the rules of evidence were relaxed during the penalty phase and because it was appellant that opened the door to the evidence by resting on hearsay evidence. The state's theory on cold calculated premeditation prevailed, was consistent with the facts, and was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the facts supported the finding of that aggravator. The court found no error in the trial court's holding that the mitigating factors presented by appellant were not supported by evidence and that, in any event, were overwhelmingly outweighed by the aggravating circumstances. The court affirmed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder. After the jury voted to recommend life sentences on both counts, the trial judge sentenced appellant to life imprisonment on one count and to death on the other. Appellant challenged his convictions and the death sentence. The trial judge found in aggravation the previous conviction of another capital offense based on the contemporaneous convictions. The trial judge concluded that the jury's life sentence recommendation was unreasonable as to one victim and, as a result, sentenced appellant to death for one murder and to life for the other murder. Appellant argued that the trial court erroneously overrode the jury's recommendation and the court agreed, holding that there was a reasonable basis for the jury's recommendation of life because appellant had a long-term drug addiction and because the jury could take into consideration appellant's youthful age.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida legislature passed and amended Fla. Stat. ch. 319.231 (1991), which imposed an impact fee on cars purchased or titled in other states that then were registered in Florida by permanent residents. Appellee citizens filed suit arguing that the fee was a tax that violated the commerce clause of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and violated their civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The lower court found ch. 319.231 unconstitutional under the commerce clause but also found that a taxpayer could bring a &sect; 1983 action in state court in a tax matter. The lower court further held that the statute did not violate anyone's right to travel. Appellant state agencies challenged the ruling that the statute violated the commerce clause, but the court rejected the argument. The court held that appellants had standing because they faced penalties for failure to pay the fee. Appellees argued that in state auto dealers were given an advantage. The court agreed and noted that the burden was placed on out-of-state economic interests and therefore violated the commerce clause. The court therefore affirmed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the impact fee affected and burdened only out-of-state economic interests in that only autos purchased out-of-state were subject to the fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with three counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death after he stabbed his wife's parents and sister and burned their home in an attempt to cover up the murders. The jury found him guilty of three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of arson, and one count of grand theft, and found him not guilty of burglary. In the penalty phase, mitigating and aggravating factors were considered. The trial judge imposed the death penalty for each murder, and appellant challenged the judgment. He raised 10 issues, including whether the trial court erred in allowing evidence of collateral crimes and bad acts, in admitting identification testimony, in excluding hearsay statements, in instructing the jury on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance and whether the death penalty was disproportionate. The court rejected all of appellant's arguments and affirmed his convictions and sentences. The court found that the trial court did not err. The court also noted that because appellant cut phone lines, stabbed his in-laws to death in the middle of the night, and burned down their house, the sentences imposed were justified.</SPAN></P>

Prisoner argued the nature of the similar crimes evidence was so disturbing that its relevance was outweighed by the potential for prejudice. The court stated that the nature of the various crimes was relevant to have established a pattern of similarities among the homicides. That pattern was relevant to the state's theory of premeditation and to have rebutted prisoner's claim that she acted in self-defense. The court held that the relevance of the similar crimes evidence clearly outweighed prejudice here. Prisoner contended that trial court erred when it denied her motion for judgment of acquittal because her testimony was uncontroverted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant brutally murdered his wife in front of their teenage son. The jury convicted him of first-degree murder, and the trial judge followed the jury's recommendation and imposed death. The judge found three aggravating circumstances: previous conviction of another felony involving violence based upon the contemporaneous convictions; that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC); and that the murder was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal justification (CCP). On appeal, he raised four issues involving the guilt phase of the proceedings and three directed to the penalty phase. The court rejected all of appellant's arguments and found no error as to the guilt phase of the proceedings, and affirmed the conviction. However, the court found that the evidence did not support the finding of CCP. The court reasoned that although there was evidence that he contemplated the murder in advance, evidence offered in support of mental mitigating circumstances negated the cold component of the CCP aggravator. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated and remanded his death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the jury recommended death sentence imposed by the Marion County Circuit Court (Florida) upon resentencing after remand from a prior appeal. Appellant alleged that the court erred on several grounds regarding jury selection, aggravating circumstances, and other related concerns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder in a prior trial brought by the state. Following past penalty phase appeals and remands arising from that conviction, appellant challenged his third resentencing which resulted in a jury recommended death penalty imposed by the trial court. Appellant alleged that the trial court erred in excusing a juror for cause despite his counsel's objection. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing for cause the juror who could not set aside his beliefs against the death penalty. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in not striking eight other jurors for cause because they were exposed to prejudicial pretrial publicity which made them predisposed in favor of the death penalty. The court held that the trial court correctly determined those jurors had not formed any opinion before trial based on media coverage. While the court agreed with appellant that the trial court erred in finding that premeditation applied as an aggravating factor, it was harmless error because the trial court correctly found three other aggravating circumstances. Thus, the court affirmed the death penalty sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's imposition of the jury recommended death penalty during resentencing because the trial court committed no reversible error in either denying appellant's requests to keep and strike jurors or in incorrectly finding an aggravating circumstance among three other valid ones.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court, after finding that appellant was denied meaningful review on direct appeal of his first-degree murder convictions and death sentence, remanded the case for appropriate state court reconsideration of appellant's death sentence. The state supreme court vacated the death sentence imposed by the trial court judge after he overrode the jury's life sentence recommendation and remanded the action for imposition of the life imprisonment sentence. The jury's life imprisonment recommendation was supported by nonstatutory mitigating circumstances, including that an accomplice actually killed the victims, that appellant was intoxicated when the murders were committed, and testimony concerning appellant's background and testimony. The trial court's override of the recommendation was improper because the jury's recommended sentence was not clearly erroneous or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court, upon remand from the United States Supreme Court, held that the trial court judge improperly overrode the jury's life imprisonment recommendation after convicting appellant of two courts of first-degree murder. The trial court's death sentence was improper because the jury's life sentence recommendation was not unreasonable in light of nonstatutory mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for robbery, attempted first-degree murder, and first-degree murder and sentences of life imprisonment and death were affirmed because victim's recantation was unreliable, defendant did not need additional counsel, and negligible mitigating evidence existed. Defendant robbed a restaurant at which his former girlfriend worked. Police arrived and an officer was killed and another wounded. Defendant was convicted. Defendant brought a motion for a new trial, which was denied. Defendant appealed, claiming a new trial was required where the girlfriend's recantation at the new trial hearing was crucial and placed the murder weapon in defendant's possession. Defendant also claimed, inter alia, that he was entitled to the appointment of co-counsel due to the trial's complexity and the death penalty was unsupported. The court affirmed, holding that because the recantation was unreliable, no new trial was required. The appointment of co-counsel was unnecessary becasuse defendant had ample access to investigators to assist him in his defense. The death sentence was upheld because negligible mitigating evidence existed and valid aggravators existed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's former girlfriend's recantation was unreliable and a new trial unwarranted. Co-counsel was unnecessary because investigators were provided to defendant.

The court of appeal reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case for trial, stating that based on the definition of the word &quot;illegal,&quot; the statute was constitutional. On an application for review, the supreme court quashed the decision of the court of appeal and remanded the case for further proceedings, holding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it provided no clear explanation of the proscribed conduct, no explicit definition of the terms used, and no good faith defense. The supreme court found that the statute violated due process because it was too vague to give notice.

The court held that there was no error in when the lower court denied prisoner's continuance. Prisoner argued that the court erred when it denied his motion for new trial because of a newly discovered witness who would testify that he saw someone else shoot the victim. The court noted that the newly discovered evidence must have been of such nature that it would probably have produced an acquittal on retrial to have been sufficient to have required reversal.

Appellant also claimed that the two witnesses lied at the trial and that the prosecution deliberately used the false testimony. The trial court denied appellant's motion for postconviction relief, refusing to admit evidence to show that the witnesses lied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that the statements were not statements against interest under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.804; therefore, they were properly not admitted under the hearsay rule. Moreover, the court rejected appellant's argument that a Brady violation occurred because the prosecution withheld information pertaining to the timing of a payment by the detective to the witness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prosecution appealed a decision of the District Court of Appeal (Florida) declaring Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 322.34(3)&nbsp;unconstitutional because an act of simple negligence in operating a motor vehicle could not be combined with the crime of driving a motor vehicle under a canceled, suspended, or revoked license to create a new criminal offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving with a suspended license causing death or injury under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 322.34(3). Defendant moved to dismiss the charge on the basis that the statute unconstitutionally criminalized mere negligence. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, finding that simple negligence could not be used to enhance a criminal act from a misdemeanor to a felony. The appellate court affirmed. The court reversed and remanded the case. The court held that when a person is charged under the statute, a determination already had been made that the person was no longer fit to be driving on Florida's highways. As such, the court held that knowingly driving with a suspended, canceled, or revoked driver's license was indeed a willful act in clear violation of the law. The court reasoned that, although a homicide may have been unintentionally committed through negligence, it was the willful act of committing the underlying felony that criminalized the simple negligence supporting the conviction for felony murder. The court, following this rationale, held, therefore, that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 322.34(3) did not unconstitutionally criminalize simple negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's decision which declared that the statute involving driving with a suspended license causing death or injury, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner compensation claims judge sought a writ of mandamus requiring respondent governor to reappoint him under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.45 (1991). Petitioner argued under the retention process statute that respondent was required to reappoint him because the nominating commission voted to retain him. Respondent contended the statute impermissibly restricted his gubernatorial power to appoint executive branch members. The court denied petitioner's requested relief, concluding the statute unconstitutionally violated separation of powers to the extent it eliminated respondent's choice in the reappointment of executive branch officers. The court explained workers' compensation claims judges were placed in the executive branch by the state legislature's choice to place them in the department of labor. The court noted that, despite the performance of a quasi-judicial function, compensation claims judges were still a part of the executive branch. As a result, the court found respondent governor had the power to appoint executive branch officials under Fla. Stat. ch. 93-415 &sect; 40.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's requested writ of mandamus requiring respondent to reappoint him as a compensation claims judge, in respondent governor's favor, because workers' compensation claims judges were executive branch members of the state department of labor and statutory appointment procedure was unconstitutionally violative of separation of powers to the extent it restricted respondent's power to appoint executive branch members.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for murder and death sentence, in appellee prosecution's favor. The court rejected appellant's numerous alleged errors in the penalty phase of his conviction and affirmed. The court explained appellant's attorney-client privilege was not violated by prosecutorial statements referring to a conversation between appellant and a defense expert. The court indicated when appellant opened the inquiry regarding those communications, he waived the protection for such communications. The court next rejected the argument that appellant was subjected to double jeopardy. The court explained that appellant was not previously acquitted of felony murder, as he suggested. Rather, the court noted the judge in the first trial merely opined enough evidence for felony murder was not presented, but nonetheless went on the give the felony murder instruction. The court found appellant's request for additional experts was properly denied when he had already been allowed to retain five experts. The court found the lower court erred in failing to consider mitigating factors for purposes of the death sentence and reversed for imposition of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's murder conviction, reversed death sentence, and remanded for life imprisonment because statements were properly admitted at trial, double jeopardy did not occur, denial of additional experts was proper, and evidence was properly admitted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county adopted a comprehensive plan which contained a thoroughfare map defining certain corridors for future roadway construction. Respondent property owners attacked the constitutionality of the thoroughfare map, arguing that the map violated U.S. Const. amend. V. and Fla. Const. art.

The trial court granted summary judgment to respondents. The appellate court affirmed the decision, but certified a question to the state supreme court regarding the map's constitutionality. The court found the map, on its face, was not an unconstitutional taking, and quashed the decision below. The court stated that the adoption of the thoroughfare map was a proper exercise of petitioner's police power because it substantially advanced a legitimate state interest and, without the map, petitioner's ability to plan for future growth would be seriously impeded. The court noted, however, that the map as applied to certain property could result in a taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the body of appellant's 3-year-old son was found abandoned in residential bushes, the jury found appellant guilty of aggravated child abuse, Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03(1)(b) (1989), and first degree murder. The Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida) followed the jury's recommendation to impose a death sentence, finding the murder especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. Id. ch. 921.141(5)(h) (1991). Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After splitting her 3-year-old son's head open with a baseball bat, appellant locked the boy in the closet where he had been confined for the past two months. The next day, appellant and her codefendant girlfriend abandoned the child's battered body in the bushes of a residence. Appellant was convicted of aggravated child abuse and first degree murder, and sentenced to death for the murder. Appellant sought review. Finding most of appellant's claims procedurally barred because they were not raised below, the court affirmed by holding that the evidence was sufficient to support both convictions and that the evidence of child abuse was within the framework of the indictment. With respect to the penalty phase, the defense could not claim as a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance that it would be in the two surviving children's best interest for appellant to be given a life sentence. Furthermore, disparate treatment was justified because appellant was more culpable than the codefendant. Finally, appellant's death sentence was warranted in light of the extended period of time that the child was subjected to the torturous abuse leading to his death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that the admissible evidence of child abuse sufficiently supported appellant's convictions for aggravated child abuse and first degree murder, the court affirmed appellant's proportional death sentence because the child was tortured for many months before he was finally beaten to death. Thus, the imposition of the death penalty did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment or violate appellant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The district court of appeal certified the issue of the statute's constitutionality to the state supreme court. The court approved the decisions of the lower court, affirmed petitioner's conviction, and remanded the other petitioners' case for appropriate action. The state supreme court determined that neither the level of intimacy nor the degree of harm was relevant when an adult and a child under the age of 16 engaged in sexual intercourse.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery. Although the jury recommended a life sentence, the trial court overrode the recommendation and imposed the death penalty, finding five aggravating factors and no mitigating factors. Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment denying his second motion for postconviction relief filed under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 and requested a stay of his execution. Appellant's claims were predicated on newly discovered evidence, which consisted of an alibi witness and the affidavits of four persons who stated that another man told them that he actually killed the victim and that appellant was innocent. The appellate court ruled that the alibi information was not newly discovered because appellant's lawyers submitted the information as part of a clemency petition and because appellant never testified at trial to being with the alibi witness. However, in view of the impending death warrant, the court ruled that appellant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to allow the affiants to testify and to allow appellant to demonstrate corroborating circumstances sufficient to establish the trustworthiness of the other man's statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death on two counts and life imprisonment on the third count. After the sentences and convictions were affirmed, defendant filed a motion to vacate judgment and sentence pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, alleging denial of due process, denial of full and fair hearing, failure to consider nonstatutory mitigating factors, and sentencing errors. Court held that lower court properly considered nonstatutory mitigation in its sentencing, as shown by its overruling of only one of the jury's recommended two life sentences despite no statutory mitigating factors and its instruction of the jury on consideration of such nonstatutory factors. Further, court held no due process problems in denial of defendant's motion, since defendant's counsel had opportunity to argue all issues in its brief and at a hearing prior to signing of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both appellant's first-degree murder and armed robbery convictions and his death sentence. It found that even though he filed a number of motions, the original trial date was never changed. Thus, no delay was attributed to his motion practice and the lower court properly denied appellant's motion for discharge. Further, the judge did not abuse his discretion in limiting the scope of questioning during voir dire. The sentencing order included a specific evaluation of nine nonstatutory mitigating factors proposed by appellant and the record supported the court's conclusion that the other proposed factors were not established by evidence or were not of a mitigating nature. Yet, the court found that the murder was not cold, calculated, and premeditated because the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had a careful plan or prearranged design, and thus, the lower court erred in finding that aggravating circumstance. But where the lower court would have imposed the same sentence even if it had not found the aggravating circumstance, the court held the error harmless.</SPAN></P>

However, because the sentence would have been imposed regardless, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A campaign finance act, Fla. Stat. ch. 106.30-106.36 (1991), was created to provide matching public funds to state office candidates. An election trust fund was created, originally funded by legislative appropriation. The election law was amended to provide for the transfer of general revenue monies to the trust fund if necessary. Fla. Stat. ch. 106.32(1) (1991). Appellant political party challenged the statute as unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the statute, and the appellate court certified the issue for review. Affirming the trial court's order, the supreme court found that the statute, which used a formula rather than a set specific dollar amount to fund the trust, was a valid appropriation of public monies, notwithstanding the use of the word &quot;transfer&quot; instead of &quot;appropriation.&quot; The statute was general substantive legislation not confined by the appropriation statutes.&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 216.011(1)(b), (c). The statutory scheme served to specify, control, and limit the funds transferred. The statute was not bound by the constitutional itemization requirement, Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 19(b), where that provision did not take effect until after the statute was enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A natural gas company filed an application for a determination of need with the Florida Public Service Commission (Commission), pursuant to Fla.

Appellant, a gas company that controlled the only other natural gas pipeline serving the area, opposed the need determination.

Appellant challenged the order claiming that Fla. Stat. ch. 403.9422 was unconstitutional and that the Commission failed to explain its rejection of certain proposed findings of fact. The court determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 403.9422 was constitutional because it provided sufficient guidelines to overcome a claim that the legislature unconstitutionally delegated its power to the Public Service Commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant planned with his girlfriend to kill his cousin because the cousin had agreed to testify against appellant in connection with a burglary. Appellant ultimately murdered both his cousin and his cousin's wife. The jury recommended death for each murder and the trial court imposed the death penalty for each. On appeal, appellant challenged his convictions and sentences. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Appellant first argued that the trial court judge erred in refusing to recuse himself because of conversations he had prior to becoming a judge with the attorney for appellant's girlfriend. The court determined that the judge had violated neither Fla. Stat. ch. 38.02 (1989) nor Fla. Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3(c) by refusing to recuse himself because the record showed no evidence of the appearance of an improper interest. The court, however, agreed with appellant that there was insufficient evidence to support convictions for two counts of conspiracy. The court noted that there was a single express agreement to commit a criminal act. Moreover, the fact that another person was also killed at the scene did not render the agreement a double conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father was convicted of sexual battery on his two-year old daughter. On appeal, the lower court held that incompetency was not the equivalent of unavailability for purposes of admitting the child's statements under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(23), and, as such, that the child's statements were improperly admitted, ordered a new trial and certified the following question as one of great public importance. The certified question was whether a finding of incompetency to testify because one was unable to recognize the duty to tell the truth satisfied the unavailable requirement of Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(23)(a)(2). The court held that an incompetent witness was unavailable within the meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 90.804(1)(d)'s existing mental infirmity requirement. The court continued that a finding of incompetency to testify because the party was unable to recognize the duty and obligation to tell the truth satisfied the testify or be unavailable requirement of Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal of the First District (Florida) certified questions for review relating to whether or not it was fundamental error for a trial court to fail to make the findings required by Fla. Stat. &sect; 92.53(1) (1989), prior to allowing a child witness to testify by videotape and, if so, could the case be remanded for a determination of whether the record supported the required statutory findings. Petitioner raised other issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with three counts of sexual battery. The state filed a motion to allow videotaped testimony of the child victim. Appellant objected. The court allowed the testimony to be videotaped. Appellant raised the same confrontation-right objection when the testimony was videotaped, but failed to object at trial. Appellant was found guilty and moved for a new trial, claiming it was error for the victim to have been allowed to testify by videotape. The motion was denied. The appellate court affirmed but certified the question as to whether the trial court's failure to make the required findings under Fla. Stat. &sect; 92.53(1) (1989), prior to allowing the child to testify by videotape, was fundamental error and, if so, could the case be remanded for a determination of whether the record supported the required statutory findings. The court found the trial court's failure to make the statutorily required findings was not fundamental error. The court did not answer the second question, but remanded on the basis that the trial court erred in allowing an expert witness to comment on the child's veracity and in allowing hearsay statements made by the child to investigators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the appellate court was quashed and the case remanded with directions to reverse the judgment of conviction and order a new trial. The failure to make the statutorily required findings did not constitute fundamental error. Reversal was warranted because the trial court admitted testimony of a child abuse expert witness that vouched for the child's truthfulness and also admitted statements made by the victim to investigators.</SPAN></P>

Prisoner argued that the jury instruction on the cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) factor was unconstitutionally vague. The lower court instructed prisoner's jury that it could have considered, if established by the evidence, that the crime for which the prisoner was to have been sentenced was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal justification. The court noted that this standard instruction, which mirrored the language of Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(i), was previously upheld by this court. Upon reconsideration, the court held that in order to have found the CCP aggravating factor the jury must have determined that the killing was the product of cool and calm reflection and not an act prompted by emotional frenzy, panic, or a fit of rage and that the prisoner had a careful plan or prearranged design to commit murder before the fatal incident and that the prisoner exhibited heightened premeditation and that prisoner had no pretense of moral or legal justification.

Plaintiff appealed, and the appellate court affirmed, holding that the statute allowed substantial restrictions and penalties to be placed upon defendants' use and enjoyment of their property without affording an opportunity to a prior hearing on the matter. The appellate court held that this failure to afford defendants an opportunity to be heard rendered the statute unconstitutional. The court agreed and affirmed the decision.

The trial judge imposed the death penalty and defendant sought to have his pleas withdrawn for a new penalty phase proceeding or imposition of a life sentence.

The court ruled that the record was devoid of proof of any good case for withdrawal. The court also held that the trial court erred in finding that the murder was committed to avoid arrest. The record contained no competent evidence showing the presence of this aggravating factor, but rather it contained evidence that the murder took place as the result of a spontaneous fight. Accordingly, the court affirmed defendant's convictions for solicitation and first-degree murder and the 30-year sentences on the solicitation counts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner psychologists challenged an order, which found that respondent psychological association had no authority to waive the educational requirements for licensure in an effort to settle petitioners' lawsuit. Petitioners' lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of state licensing statutes. The court reversed and remanded with directions that a previous settlement agreement between the parties be honored. The court found that a ruling adverse to petitioners would make it extremely difficult for agencies to accomplish settlements that were clearly in the best interests of the citizens of the state. The court further found that refusing to uphold the settlement would have the effect of discouraging third parties from ever trying to settle their controversies with state governmental agencies. Finally, the court found that under principles of fundamental fairness, the settlement should be upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Broward County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, armed robbery, sexual battery, and attempted first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in overruling defense counsel's objections to the testimony of a state witness who testified at the competency hearing and at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and several other offenses, and was sentenced to death. On appeal, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in overruling defense counsel's objections to the testimony of a state witness who testified at the competency hearing and at trial. The appellate court reversed and remanded appellant's convictions. The court ruled that appellant's evaluation by a psychiatrist at the county jail was acceptable to determine whether he needed further mental health evaluation or could be put into the general population. However, defense counsel was entitled to notice because the psychiatrist was the state's key witness at appellant's competency hearing. The court ruled that lack of notice would not have been a problem if the witness's testimony was confined to his observations of appellant, as opposed to his expert opinions about appellant's competency and sanity. Because it was not, the lack of notice violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 and appellant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right to consult with counsel. The witness's testimony as to appellant's sanity violated appellant's U.S. Const. amend. V right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded appellant's convictions and death sentence because the state violated appellant's constitutional rights by failing to give defense counsel notice of its intention to have a witness evaluate appellant and testify regarding issues of competency. The court noted that the witness was crucial because the court-appointed mental health experts testified that appellant was incompetent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, possession of a short-barreled shotgun, and grand theft of an automobile. The trial court sentenced appellant to death. On appeal, appellant contended the trial court erred in admitting evidence obtained from electronic eavesdropping of statements he and a co-defendant made in their prison cells and in sentencing him to death because he was 15 years old at the time of the crime. The appellate court ruled that the trial court did not err in admitting the jailhouse conversation because there was neither improper police involvement in inducing the conversation, nor any intrusion into a privileged or otherwise confidential or private communication. The court noted that voluntary jailhouse conversations between inmates were not entitled to the same degree of privacy afforded some other communications. However, the court ruled that the death penalty was either cruel or unusual if imposed upon one who was under the age of 16 when he committed the crime and, thus, was prohibited by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court vacated the death sentence and reduced it to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 25 years.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 16.061 (1993), the Attorney General petitioned the court for an advisory opinion on the validity of a proposed amendment to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The proposed amendment would prevent the state from passing any law regarding discrimination that would establish a right or privilege based upon a characteristic, trait, status, or condition other than race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, ethnic background, marital status, or familial status. The supreme court declined to place the proposed amendment on the ballot because it embraced more than one subject and matter, in violation of Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. The proposed amendment violated the single-subject requirement because it enumerated ten classifications of people that would be entitled to protection, and it covered both civil rights and the powers of the state and local governments. The court also held that the ballot summary regarding the proposed amendment failed to adequately describe the amendment and it was ambiguous in that it was confusing to voters, in violation of Fla.

After respondent denied the state's request for a stay of the administrative proceeding pending the state's decision to file a petition for writ of prohibition with the state supreme court, the state supreme court granted the stay. The state then sought an order from the court prohibiting respondent from proceeding further with certification of a bargaining unit for petitioner SEAG.

Stat. ch. 775.085 (1989), was constitutional. The statute required a penalty enhancement when the commission of a crime evidenced prejudice based on certain enumerated characteristics of the victim. Respondent was charged with simple battery. Respondent's penalty was reclassified as a hate crime, thus, it went from a first-degree misdemeanor for simple battery to a third-degree felony. Petitioner argued that the enhancement was appropriate because respondent selected his victim based on ethnicity. The trial court granted respondent's motion to dismiss the enhancement and held that the hate crime statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the statute was constitutional because it targeted criminal acts in which the selection of the victim was an integral part of the underlying crime. Therefore, the conduct was not speech but fell outside the protection of U.S. Const. amend. I and could be banned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were charged separately under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13.(1)(i), which imposed enhanced penalties for controlled substances violations within 200 feet of a public housing facility. The statute was found unconstitutionally vague in the actions against two of the defendants and was found constitutional in the action against the third defendant. Two district courts of appeal applied for review of the decisions regarding the constitutionality of ch. 893.13(1)(i). The supreme court held that the statute was facially invalid under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. The supreme court determined that the phrase &quot;public housing facility&quot; was so imprecise that it was impossible to tell from the statute's plain language what conduct the legislature intended to target. Citizens did not have fair warning about what conduct was forbidden. As a result, arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement was likely. The supreme court affirmed the two court of appeal decisions which found the statute unconstitutional and quashed the decision which found the statute constitutional. The case in which the decision was quashed was remanded.</SPAN></P>

In his motion for postconviction relief, defendant sought inspection of sealed state attorney's files. The court affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief, holding that defendant's claims were procedurally barred because they were found meritless on direct appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the coworkers of the deceased, challenged the decision of the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida), which reversed the trial court's order that dismissed appellee executor's negligence action and found Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1) (Supp. 1988) unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 21.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee executor, the husband of an employee killed in the parking lot of the employer's store, sued appellants, the co-workers of deceased, for negligence for failing to take precautions to prevent his wife's death. The trial court dismissed appellee's complaint, finding that under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1) (Supp. 1988), that appellee's exclusive remedy was workers' compensation benefits and that appellants were immune from liability absent allegations that appellants had committed a criminal offense identified in ch. 440.11(1). The district court reversed the trial court, ruling that the amendment to ch. 440.11(1) unconstitutionally limited access to the courts in violation of Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 21. The court quashed the district court's decision and directed the trial court to dismiss appellee's complaint. The court found that ch. 440.11(1), as amended, was not unconstitutional because it merely limited the liability of coemployees to actions of gross negligence; it did not abolish a right to redress for an injury. The court further held that even if the amendment to ch. 440.11(1) had abolished a remedy, it provided a reasonable alternative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the district court's decision because a law providing workers' compensation benefits as the exclusive remedy for the ordinary negligence of coemployees was constitutional in that it did not eliminate an existing remedy.

Regarding petitioner's claim that he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing based on the fact that a substitute judge sentenced petitioner on remand, the court held that evolutionary developments in the law regarding the application of Florida's death penalty statute were not retroactively applied to final judgments. Furthermore, the court held that the claim was procedurally barred because petitioner failed to preserve the issue for review. Petitioner's claims regarding jury instructions on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator were also procedurally barred based on petitioner's failure to raise the issue during the direct appeal. Finally, the court held that petitioner failed to establish ineffective assistance of the appellate counsel because petitioner failed to prove that there was either deficient performance or prejudice to petitioner.

Petitioner appealed. Court held that the substantive rights of petitioner were fixed as of the time of injury. Further, court held that since the earlier statute had been declared unconstitutional because of the form of its enactment rather than because the legislature lacked power to enact it, and since the curative statutes in question had been expressly made applicable retroactively to the effective date of the statute, the statute in question was in effect at the time of petitioner's accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing the lower court's mandate that appellant receive a blood transfusion to prevent the abandonment of her four minor children, the court quashed the order, finding that no abandonment was proven to override appellant's constitutional rights. It held that it was not appropriate for a hospital to assert state interests to defeat a patient's decision to forgo emergency medical treatment. Further, it found that appellant's rejection of a blood transfusion did not constitute abandonment of her minor children. The law presumed that had appellant died under these circumstances, her husband would have become the sole legal guardian of the couple's children. As there was no evidence presented that he was unable or unwilling to care for the children, the lower court erred in holding that sufficient evidence was presented to override appellant's constitutional right to refuse medical treatment. Moreover, it erred by suggesting that absent firsthand proof, the law should presume abandonment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the lower court's order to transfuse the unwilling appellant, holding that the state's interest in maintaining a home for minor children was not compelling enough to override appellant's constitutional rights and that the state had mistakenly presumed that appellant's potential death would leave the children abandoned when in fact their father would become their guardian.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the injunction violated its constitutional rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, equal protection, and the free exercise of religion. Focusing mainly on the freedom of speech issue, the court reviewed the injunction on certification. The court first determined that the area included was a public forum and then held that the restrictions were content-neutral and narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest that left open alternative means of communication. The court also determined that the restrictions were not a prior restraint, were not vague or overbroad, and, because they affected the health, safety, and rights of Florida women, were the least intrusive means possible of protecting the public safety. The court therefore affirmed the amended permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 847.012. Petitioner rented two X-rated videotapes to a minor informant as a result of a police operation. The court considered whether Fla. Stat. 777.201 abolished the objective entrapment test that was established through case law. The court found that the objective test was indeed abolished and replaced by a subjective test of whether a criminal defendant had been entrapped by law enforcement. The subjective test involved a shifting burden of proof. However, the court observed that the legislature could not prohibit the judiciary from analyzing whether a petitioner's due process rights under the Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, had been violated. The court concluded that it did not have to reach the due process question because petitioner had been entrapped under the subjective test of Fla. Stat. ch. 777.201 as a matter of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney sought review of complainant state bar association's referee's reports in consolidated disciplinary proceedings, which found respondent guilty of misconduct and recommended concurrent 30-day suspensions. The court approved the referee's findings and recommended discipline. The subject proceedings involved respondent allegedly not obtaining court approval of a settlement that was reached with an insurance company for personal injuries sustained by a minor and respondent's failure to effect a public sale after obtaining a judgment in foreclosure for his clients. Respondent contended that there was no evidence to support the referee's findings of fact. However, the court held that when respondent failed to respond to complainant's requests for admissions, the requests were properly deemed admitted. Respondent further asserted that entry of summary judgment was not authorized in disciplinary proceedings. The court held that such a contention was without merit. Under Fla. Bar Rule 3-7.6(e)(1), once a formal complaint had been filed and forwarded to a referee for hearing, the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure applied except where otherwise provided in the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of complainant state bar association's referee finding respondent attorney guilty of misconduct and recommending concurrent 30-day suspensions was approved because substantial competent evidence to support the referee's findings in both cases was found, and respondent's contentions were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state agency developed a tidal flow system based on petitioner's patented design. Petitioner designed a tidal flow system to prevent the stagnation of water and the accumulation of debris in waterways through the use of a one-way tidal gate. Petitioner's patent infringement claim in federal court was dismissed because suit against the state was barred by U.S. Const. amend. XI. The lower court found federal patent law preempted petitioner's claims, and the state therefore did not have subject matter jurisdiction. The state supreme court found that Congress did not intend to exclude a remedy simply because U.S. Const. amend. XI granted the state immunity from suit. Because a patent is property, it was protected under the state and federal constitutions, as was petitioner's state constitutional right of access to the state courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.

The court noted that it was prospectively allowing hearings on post-conviction motions in capital cases because of the severity of punishment in a death penalty case. However, the court noted that because the rule was prospective it did not apply to petitioner. The court found no other reversible errors that would change the finding of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor that supported petitioner's death sentence and stated that the evidence clearly established the aggravating factor. Petitioner's habeas corpus petition was found without merit and dismissed. The trial court denial of the Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 post-conviction motion was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The county issued the permits and transmitted copies to the Department of Community Affairs (Department) under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 380.072(1987). The Department appealed those orders to the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission (commission) and requested that the development orders be reversed as illegal and violative of the provisions of the county land development plan. At a hearing petitioners refused to participate and failed to present any evidence, and the commission denied the permits. On appeal, the order was affirmed. At issue was which party bears the burden of ultimate persuasion and the burden of going forward with the evidence in an &quot;appeal&quot; to the Florida Land and Water Adjudicatory Commission pursuant to &sect; 380.07. The court determined that under the statute, the agency carried the ultimate burden of persuasion and the burden of going forward. The court reasoned that the statutory framework did not address which party carried the burden, and that the burden of proof rested on the party asserting the affirmative before an administrative tribunal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping with intent to commit sexual battery, attempted burglary, and two counts of battery and sentenced to death.

VIII. The court denied the petition, first explaining that petitioner's claim regarding the use of the contemporaneous kidnapping conviction was previously disposed of by the court and thus was procedurally barred. Further, because petitioner failed to object to the subject jury instruction on vagueness grounds during the trial, the issue was not preserved for appellate review and was procedurally barred. Finally, the court explained that both petitioner's U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death for two counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder. Appellant argued for reversal on grounds of erroneous admission of a witness's prior statement and improper joinder. The court reversed and remanded the convictions and sentences and held that hearsay was a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The state used a witness's hearsay statement, not for impeachment purposes, but as substantive evidence. As such, it was inadmissible hearsay. Accordingly, because the improper evidence was such a prominent feature of the trial, the court held that it was unable to find that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, a joinder issue was remanded as being moot because reversal was warranted on the aforementioned grounds. The court also directed that the issue of age mitigation be evaluated upon remand and that a police officer's testimony, concerning appellant's popularity at school because of his hatred for blacks, was irrelevant, inflammatory, and an impermissible comment on character.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment convicting and sentencing appellant to death for murder and attempted murder was reversed and remanded because the prior inconsistent testimony of a witness, which was purportedly used for impeachment purposes, was, in reality, used substantively and violated the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>

Appellee then filed a declaratory judgment action, challenging the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 473.323(1)(l) (1989), which prohibited CPAs from engaging in personal solicitation. Appellee also challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 473.317 (1989), which banned CPAs from making a competitive bid for a professional engagement. The trial court declared both statutes unconstitutional, and the lower court affirmed the ruling with respect to the competitive bidding statute but upheld the constitutionality of the solicitation statute. The supreme court affirmed the lower court's decision regarding the competitive bidding statute but quashed the decision with regard to the solicitation statute. The supreme court held that appellant board could regulate the profession of accountancy in an attempt to assure quality audits but that its regulations could not restrict economic expression protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Both sections were unconstitutional as they restricted commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that both sections and the regulations enacted thereunder were invalid as unconstitutional restrictions of protected commercial speech in violation of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) applied for review of its decision to reverse the trial court's order suppressing evidence of a gun that had been discarded prior to an officer's seizure of petitioner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer approached petitioner because he believed petitioner was involved in a narcotics transaction. After petitioner ran, the officer caught him and gave him Miranda warnings. The officer recovered a firearm, which petitioner had discarded during the pursuit. Petitioner was charged with carrying a concealed firearm, Fla. Stat. ch. 790.01, and carrying a concealed firearm by a convicted felon, Fla. Stat. ch. 790.23. The trial court granted petitioner's motion to suppress the gun on the ground that it was seized as a direct result of an illegal stop. The court of appeal reversed, holding that the firearm was admissible because it had been abandoned prior to any search. The court of appeal applied for review of its decision on the basis of direct conflict with a Fourth District Court of Appeal decision. Based on a ruling by the United States Supreme Court, the state supreme court approved the court of appeal's reversal. Petitioner was not &quot;seized&quot; within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. IV when he dropped the gun, and the recovery of the abandoned gun was not the fruit of an unlawful seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police found the nude and strangled bodies of two women. Appellant was identified as a suspect because a witness identified his truck and because plaster casts of the tire tracks found near one of the bodies were similar to those on appellant's truck. Police discovered a restraining device, a hair, and one of the victim's driver's license in appellant's truck. During the trial for the first murder, the state introduced evidence of appellant's murder of the other victim to establish his identity as the killer. The jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, and the trial judge followed the jury recommendation and imposed a death sentence. On appeal, appellant raised numerous issues in the guilt and penalty phase of the trial. The court rejected all of appellant's arguments concerning the guilt phase of the trial, but found that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant killed with the necessary heightened premeditation. The court held that the case had to be remanded to reweigh the aggravating circumstance of cold, calculated, and premeditated, and the statutory and nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Appellee school board members had filed the action to determine the constitutionality of the statute and to order appellant tax collector to collect and remit the nonvoted discretionary millage set by appellees. The court reversed the decision and remanded the matter for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. The court found that the constitutional provision that authorized appellees to levy ad valorem taxes was not self-executing because it indicated such authority was limited to such taxes as authorized by law. The court determined that ch. 236.25(1) was the enabling legislation under the constitutional provision and limited the taxing authority of appellees. The court concluded that the constitutional provision and the statute could be harmonized and could co-exist. The court also found it was error not to join appellant board of education as a party to the original declaratory judgment action because appellant tax collector did not really have a vested interest in defending a state statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal to the state supreme court, the appellate court's decision was reversed and remanded. The court held that the statutes which provided a monetary cap on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice claims when a party requested arbitration did not violate a claimant's right of access to the courts because they provided a commensurate benefit to plaintiffs in exchange for the monetary cap.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was convicted by a jury of kidnapping and first-degree murder, was sentenced to death.

The court affirmed the convictions and the death sentence, holding that there was sufficient evidence of premeditation and of kidnapping to support appellant's conviction on a felony-murder conviction. Appellant's confessions were properly admitted because in proving corpus delicti circumstantial evidence was sufficient; proof beyond a reasonable doubt was not necessary. Many of appellant's points or error were not preserved for review; thus, the court evaluated the alleged errors to see if any were fundamental. The court concluded that the claimed errors, taken individually or collectively, did not constitute fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed from order of District Court of Appeal, First District (Florida), which denied petition for certiorari from decision granting defendant man's request for jury trial in paternity suit and declaring Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 742.031 (1991) unconstitutional, and District Court of Appeal certified the question of statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother sued defendant man seeking a determination of paternity and an award of child support under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 742.031 (1991). Defendant requested a jury trial. The trial judge granted his request, finding &sect; 742.031&nbsp;unconstitutional because it denied defendant the right to jury trial as guaranteed by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The appellate court denied a petition for certiorari and certified to the court the question of the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that the Florida Constitution preserved the right to jury trial in paternity proceedings and declared unconstitutional that portion of &sect; 742.031 that required paternity proceedings to be tried by the judge. The Florida Constitution guaranteed a right to jury trial in those cases where, at the time of the adoption of the constitution, the law gave that right. Before the Florida Constitution became effective, the Bastardy Act of 1828 permitted a woman to sue the alleged father of her illegitimate child and obtain child support. Under that act, the issue of paternity was to be tried before a jury. Accordingly, the Florida Constitution preserved the right to jury trial in paternity proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the Florida Constitution preserved the right to jury trial in paternity proceedings because, prior to adoption of the Constitution, there was a right to jury trial in paternity proceedings. It declared unconstitutional that portion of the statute that required paternity proceedings to be tried by a judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of four counts of first degree murder, one count of attempted first degree murder, and six counts of armed kidnapping. Appellant was sentenced to concurrent life sentences for the attempted murder and kidnapping charges. In addition, the trial judge rejected the jury's life recommendation for the murder convictions and sentenced appellant to death. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's convictions, finding appellant's claims that the trial court erred in interrupting the defense's cross-examination of a key state witness, admitting certain other crimes evidence, and allowing the state to peremptorily challenge a juror solely on the basis of race to be without merit. The court also affirmed the trial judge's override of the jury's life recommendation and imposition of the death penalty. Because certain enhancement factors were not properly established, however, the court vacated appellant's concurrent life sentences and remanded with instructions to sentence appellant to concurrent thirty-year terms instead.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was the subject of three death sentences. In his second motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, he raised four grounds for relief.

Subsequently, petitioner sought review of that denial. In his appeal, petitioner also filed a motion for oral argument, a motion for stay of execution, and a petition for habeas corpus. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the Rule 3.850 motion because it found that all of petitioner's asserted grounds for relief were barred on procedural grounds. In addition, the court denied the request for habeas relief, because petitioner failed to demonstrate that his counsel's performance on appeal was deficient and that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different absent the deficient performance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the decision of the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) that upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 322.055(1) (Supp. 1990), a statute requiring the revocation of a driver's license upon conviction for possession of or trafficking in a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court refused to enforce Fla. Stat. ch. 322.055(1) (Supp. 1990), which required revocation of petitioner's driver's license after his conviction for cocaine possession, ruling that ch. 322.055(1) was unconstitutional under the substantive due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The appellate court overruled the decision, and petitioner appealed. Approving the appellate court's decision and finding the statute constitutionally valid, the supreme court ruled that the penalty of license revocation was enacted to deter drug possession and reduce the mobility of those involved in drugs. Because ch. 322.055(1) was rationally related to the legislative goal, substantive due process was not violated. The court found that ch. 322.055(1) was constitutional even where no motor vehicle was used in the crime because Florida law did not require a direct relationship between punishment and offense, and driving was a privilege that could be taken away as a means of meeting a legitimate legislative goal. The court held that because people within the legally formed class were accorded equal treatment under ch. 322.055(1), equal protection was not violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the appellate court's ruling that the statute requiring the revocation of a driver's license upon conviction of cocaine possession was constitutional, holding that the statute violated neither substantive due process nor equal protection.

The court reversed the lower court's decision to the extent that it permitted petitioner to be sentenced as a habitual felony offender based upon an out-of state conviction because 1989 Fla.

He was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. He entered a second guilty plea, and a penalty phase jury recommended the death penalty. Defendant was denied a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion and federal habeas corpus relief. After defendant's second Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion was denied, defendant appealed. The court reversed for a second sentencing proceeding, which resulted in the imposition of the death penalty. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. Use of the prior testimony of a witness was allowed because the testimony was taken in the course of a judicial proceeding; the party against whom the evidence was offered was a party in the former proceeding; the issues were similar; and a substantial reason was shown why the original witness was not available. Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated by brief cross-examinations because it was only required that he have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. The court found it was error to admit autopsy photographs, but such error was harmless given the testimony of eyewitnesses and the medical examiner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his jury trial conviction for first degree murder and jury recommended death penalty sentence imposed by the Hillsborough County Circuit Court (Florida). Appellant alleged trial court errors in both the guilt and penalty phases of trial, with a main focus upon the proportionality of the sentence under these facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for first degree murder and death penalty sentence imposed. The court considered and rejected as meritless appellant's claims of error in the guilt phase. The court reviewed appellant's claimed trial court errors in the penalty phase. The court agreed with appellant that the trial court erred in both instructing the jury that, and itself concluding that, the murder was committed in a premeditated manner. The court found that while premeditation existed, this aggravating circumstance was not established beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that the record showed the mitigating factor of appellant's controlled substance problem and that he murdered victim while intoxicated by cocaine. The court ruled the jury was improperly instructed to consider premeditation as an aggravating circumstance. Therefore, the court decided that the death sentence was disproportionate here because only one aggravating circumstance actually existed, while three mitigating factors applied. The court vacated the death penalty and imposed a life sentence without parole for twenty-five years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's jury trial conviction for first degree murder for appellee, but vacated the jury recommended and trial court imposed death penalty, because it was error to have found premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt and, thus, proportionality warranted the court's imposing a sentence of life without parole for twenty-five years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were convicted of felony petit theft, a violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 812.014(2)(d), and sentenced as habitual felony offenders. The district court certified a question to determine whether double jeopardy clauses were violated by the reclassification of petitioners' offense as felony petit theft and then used to enhance their sentence pursuant to the habitual violent felony offender statute. The court held that each petitioner had at least two prior petit theft convictions, each were guilty of the substantive offense of felony petit theft as a separate felony, and the habitualization was independent of petitioners' prior petit thefts. The U.S. Const. and Fla. Const. principles that prohibited courts from imposing multiple punishments for the same offense were not an issue. In enacting &sect; 812.014(2)(d), the legislature determined that a third or subsequent conviction for petit theft was the separate, substantive offense of felony petit theft and not an enhanced punishment. However, the record reflected that one petitioner was sentenced as a habitual violent felony offender under an amendment that violated the single subject provision of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the negative because the punishment imposed on petitioners did not violate double jeopardy principles.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner entered into a 99-year lease in 1956 to lease city-owned land for the use as a private golf course.

Ann. &sect; 196.199(4) (1991), or to have the value of the lease excluded from the value of the land for real estate tax purposes. The trial court entered judgment against petitioner, and the appellate court affirmed the judgment and certified the question of the exemption and the exclusion. The court held that because &sect; 196.199(4) (1991) did not expressly exempt leases entered into before 1976 from taxation, and because Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(a) exempted city owned property from taxation only if it were being used for a public purpose, petitioner was not exempt from paying real estate taxes. Because the intangible tax on the lease and the real estate tax were two separate taxes on different types of property, there was no double taxation and the value of the lease could not be excluded from the value of the land for real estate for tax purposes.

Decedent's nephew was named as the personal representative of the deceased. The deceased also left to petitioner the residuary of her probate estate.

The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of petitioner. The ruling was reversed and remanded, as the district court held that the inter vivos trust was valid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to rape and first-degree murder. The trial court sentenced appellant to death, but the sentence was reversed. Upon resentencing, the state supreme court affirmed appellant's death sentence. However, a federal appeals court remanded for resentencing because appellant appeared in leg irons before the penalty-phase jury. The trial court again imposed the death sentence. Appellant again sought review of his sentence. The state supreme court remanded for resentencing because it determined that the trial court's failure to conduct a Richardson hearing after allegations of discovery misconduct were raised by the defense constituted reversible error. The state supreme court also determined that the sentencing court erred in failing to consider evidence of an abuse childhood as a mitigating circumstance; that it erred in improperly admitting photos of a victim's corpse; and that it erred in giving jury instructions regarding contemporaneous rape as a prior violent felony.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that appellant failed to show that there was an abuse of discretion in the refusal to grant appellant more peremptory challenges during the trial, in the refusal to grant appellant's proposed jury instruction, and in excluding cumulative testimony. Furthermore, the court held that the proper standard was used in weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors and that the evidence supported the conclusion that the crime of the pregnant woman was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner with no pretense of moral or legal justification. In addition, the jury instruction on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms were sufficiently defined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was riding a bicycle that was not equipped with a bell or gong as required by a city ordinance. A police officer stopped petitioner and arrested him for violation of the ordinance. Incidental to the arrest, the officer searched petitioner and found a handgun in his pocket. Petitioner was charged with carrying a concealed firearm, and he filed a motion to suppress the seized evidence. The lower court denied the motion, and petitioner was convicted. The lower court further found that the ordinance was constitutional. The supreme court held that when a person was charged with violating a municipal ordinance regulating conduct that was noncriminal in nature, Fla. Stat. ch. 901.15(1) (1989) only permitted a person to be detained for the limited purpose of issuing a ticket, summons, or notice to appear. A full custodial arrest was unreasonable. However, the court affirmed the denial of petitioner's motion to suppress the evidence because the arrest was made in reliance on the city ordinance. Evidence obtained after a search incident to an arrest in reliance on a municipal ordinance was not to be suppressed even when the ordinance was subsequently declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants enacted legislation that altered the leave policy for appellees' career service employees. Appellees claimed that appellants' actions abridged their right to collectively bargain, which was guaranteed by the state constitution. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court's decision declaring Fla. Const. &sect; 9.3 (A) 5 of the 1988 Appropriations Act unconstitutional. The court stated that where the legislature provides enough money to implement the benefit as negotiated, but attempts to unilaterally change the benefit, the changes will not be upheld, and the negotiated benefit will be enforced. Where the legislature does not appropriate enough money to fund a negotiated benefit, as it is free to do, then the conditions it imposes on the use of the funds will stand even if contradictory to the negotiated agreement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's decision declaring a proviso in the state appropriations bill unconstitutional was reversed because appellants had the right to impose conditions on the use of funds so long as they appropriated enough money, even if it was contradictory to the negotiated agreement with appellees.</SPAN></P>

In addition, one of the victim's statements that identified defendant as the person who had set her on fire was properly admitted as a dying declaration. The trial court properly found that the aggravators outweighed the mitigators and imposed two death sentences. The court also affirmed the two life sentences for arson and robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed two consolidated cases from the District Court of Appeal (Florida) in which the court invalidated as unconstitutional, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 395.011(10)(b), 395.0115(5)(b), 766.101(6)(b), holding that plaintiff physicians were not required to post a bond to guarantee defendants' costs and attorney fees before bringing an action against defendant medical review boards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated appeals from two cases. In each case plaintiff physician filed suit against defendant hospital after it revoked or restricted plaintiff's hospital privileges, and the trial court required plaintiffs to post a bond. The court reversed because Fla. Stat. Ann.  &sect; 395.011(10)(b) (1987), Fla. Stat. Ann.  &sect; 395.0115(5)(b) (1987), and Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 766.101(6)(b) (1988) shared language that required a plaintiff to post a bond to pay for costs and attorney's fees. The court found that the bond requirements were unconstitutional because requirements interfered with plaintiffs' right to access to the court, based on plaintiffs' inability to post bond. Access to the courts could be restricted if the plaintiff had an alternative reasonable remedy or commensurate benefit, or there was an overpowering public necessity for the abolishment of the right. Because the bond requirement was not the only method of reducing the number of frivolous suits filed by disgruntled physicians against medical review boards, the court found that the bond requirement arbitrarily cut off a plaintiff's right to be heard solely because of inability to post bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the lower court that required plaintiff physicians post a bond before they filed lawsuits against defendant hospital was reversed because the bond requirement arbitrarily cut off a plaintiff's right to be heard, and the bond requirement was not the only method of meeting the necessity of reducing the amount of frivolous lawsuits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal (Florida) requested the court to determine whether a wrongful birth action could be extinguished by the four-year statute of repose if the genetically impaired child was born more than four years after the negligent diagnosis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs had a deformed son. They received genetic testing and were advised that their son's impairment was not a genetic defect. They had a second child with the same deformities. A test disclosed the condition was inherited. Plaintiffs filed suit for wrongful birth, wrongful life, and for the mental anguish suffered by the family. The lower court struck the wrongful life and mental anguish claims and found that the statute of repose barred most of the claims. The intermediate appellate court reversed in part. The question was certified for immediate review and the court affirmed in part. The court found the statute of repose in a medical malpractice case began to run at the time of the incident of malpractice regardless of whether it was fraudulently concealed. The court found that plaintiff parents were entitled to recover for mental anguish because the impact doctrine, which required them to be in the zone of danger, did not apply in the context of wrongful birth claims. Plaintiffs were entitled to recover for extraordinary costs after their deformed son reached majority because such costs were quantifiable with reasonable certainty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases were consolidated on appeal because two panels of the District Court of Appeals (Florida) reached conflicting conclusions as to the applicability of the statute of repose in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1975), which was repealed by the legislature in 1986.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two wrongful death cases were consolidated for appeal. In one case, the decedent was killed when a multi-piece rim and wheel assembly exploded and struck him. In the second case, a machine accidentally caused a death. At the time that both products were manufactured, a statute of repose, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1975), was in effect. That statute was repealed before the deaths occurred and after the repose period had run. One appellate court panel ruled that a vested right existed which could not have been taken away by the repeal of the statute of repose. The other panel held that because of the repeal, the statute of repose was not applicable under any circumstances after its repeal, and the panel allowed the products liability claim to proceed. The court on appeal ruled that when the period of repose expired, any cause of action was extinguished by operation of law. The repeal of the statute of repose could not operate to revive a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adopted the view of the appellate court panel that held once the statute of repose extinguished a cause of action, nothing could revive the case, including the repeal of the statute of repose. The court reversed the other appellate decision that had held that the statute's repeal permitted a products liability action to proceed even though it had lapsed prior to the repeal of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Pasco County (Florida), which convicted defendant of first-degree murder and armed robbery and sentenced him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and armed robbery. In accordance with the jury recommendation, the trial court sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred by not allowing him to question prospective jurors on voir dire as to their willingness to impose a similar penalty as that imposed upon a codefendant, if they found the defendant equally or less culpable. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred by imposing the death penalty where the jury indicated that defendant was less culpable than a codefendant who was sentenced to life imprisonment. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that the trial court did not commit error during voir dire because defendant's counsel had sufficient latitude to question the jurors to obtain fair and impartial jurors. Additionally, the court noted that the sentencing jury was fully aware of the sentence received by the codefendant, and defense counsel was not limited in the manner in which to assert that his client was less culpable in the commission of the murder. The court affirmed the sentences because deciding the verdict was exclusively the jury's job.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions for first-degree murder and armed robbery and defendant's death sentence because the trial court committed no reversible error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Volusia County (Florida) convicting him of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, solicitation, conspiracy, and burglary and sentencing him to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, solicitation, conspiracy, and burglary and death sentences were upheld where the trial court properly considered aggravating factors and no severance of offenses was necessary. Defendant and his girlfriend shot a man to avoid revelation of defendant's counterfeiting. Defendant enlisted a man to kill his wife in a fake burglary. Defendant killed the hitman in order to make the burglary appear real. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed, claiming the trial court erred in excluding black jurors, in failing to sever the murder counts, in improperly considering the aggravating factors that the crimes were committed for pecuniary gain, and in improperly finding the murders were heinous. The court affirmed. The two black jurors were properly excluded for race-neutral reasons. Where the two murders were connected in an episodic sense, no severance was necessary. Because defendant killed the hitman in order to cover up a crime and the murders were premeditated and committed for pecuniary gain, these aggravators were properly considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Volusia County (Florida), convicting and sentencing him for first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, solicitation to commit first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first degree murder, and burglary of a dwelling while armed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, attempted murder, solicitation, conspiracy, and burglary. Defendant alleged that the state used peremptory challenges to exclude black prospective jurors. He failed to meet the burden of demonstrating the likelihood that this was the case, and the state gave racially neutrally explanations for their challenges. The offenses with which defendant was charged were connected in an episodic and in a temporal sense, so defendant was not entitled to severance. Because defendant opened the door for further cross-examination regarding his prior convictions, there was no error in the state's questioning regarding this impeachment evidence. There was no error in failure to grant a hearing on the state's failure to provide defense counsel with a transcript copy because the trial court was not apprised of the alleged violation. The record contained substantial competent evidence to support defendant's convictions. Defendant failed to renew a severance motion at sentencing, there were no objections to the penalty phase instructions, nor were there requests for special jury instructions. Defendant's claims regarding his sentences were not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences for murder, attempted murder, solicitation, conspiracy, and burglary were affirmed because there was no reversible error found in the court's decisions on peremptory challenges, denial of severance, impeachment of defendant, lack of hearing on an alleged discovery violation, aggravating circumstances, and the constitutionality of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant appealed from the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree murder, and related crimes arising from incidents of robbery and home invasion that occurred on two consecutive days which were tried together. Defendant appealed his death sentence and guilt based on various alleged evidentiary errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder, armed robbery, conspiracy to commit a felony, attempted armed robbery, armed burglary with an assault, aggravated assault, and attempted first-degree murder. The charges stemmed from two incidents that occurred on consecutive days. Defendant appealed his conviction and his death sentence and the court affirmed. It was not error to exclude deposition testimony of a defense witness who failed to appear for trial. Although Fla. Stat. ch. 90.804(2)(a) (1989) provided an exception to the hearsay rule for deposition testimony of an unavailable witness, Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(j) still applied, requiring notice to opposing counsel when a deposition was taken that may be used at trial. Although defendant moved for severance of his trial from the other defendants, he never moved for severance of the charges, so that claim was not preserved for appeal and it was not fundamental error that the trial court should have corrected sua sponte. Evidence that defendant pursued his victim and shot repeatedly while the victim begged for his life was evidence that the crime was heinous, atrocious, or cruel, justifying the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction on murder and other charges and the death sentence holding that the trial court did not error in excluding deposition testimony from an unavailable witness because the deposition was not taken with notice to opposing counsel that it may be used at trial. Evidence that defendant enjoyed or was utterly indifferent to the suffering of his victim supported imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Stat. chs. 106.29(1)(b), 106.07(3)(b), and 106.04(4)(b)(2) were declared unconstitutional by two trial courts after interested entities objected to financial assessments which funded causes and candidates they did not wish to support. The spirit of the laws centered upon allowing fair access to political office. On review, the court surmised that the laws, although well intentioned, were not appropriate. The court determined that the laws infringed upon the U.S. Const. amend. I constitutional rights of those who did not support adversaries in government or elections. The court held that the means chosen to advance the state interest was unduly burdensome and was not tailored narrowly enough to withstand constitutional scrutiny.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Florida challenged a judgment from the Trial Court, in and for Leon County (Florida), on Direct Appeal of Judgment to the Florida Supreme Court, in appellee's action for declaratory relief where the trial court declared unconstitutional Florida's insurance premium tax scheme, Fla. Stat. ch. 624.509, .512, .514, and where the trial court held appellant's proposed tax assessments invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, insurance companies residing outside of the state of Florida, sought a declaratory judgment that the state's insurance premium tax scheme, Fla. Stat. ch. 624.509, .512, and .514, unconstitutionally discriminated against them under the equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the due process clause of the Florida Constitution. After an evidentiary trial, the trial court found that the premium tax, on its face, discriminated against foreign insurance companies, and declared the scheme unconstitutional. The trial court found the state's proposed tax assessments invalid, but upheld Florida's retaliatory tax, Fla. Stat. ch. 624.429 (1983-1987). The supreme court reversed to the extent that the trial court found ch. 624.509, .512, and .514 invalid because the tax scheme was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. Florida had more control and regulatory influence over a domestic insurer than over a foreign insurer, and Florida was in a better position to protect the interests of Florida policyholders. The supreme court affirmed that portion of the judgment upholding ch. 624.429.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the trial court ruling that Florida's insurance premium tax scheme was unconstitutional and that appellant State of Florida's tax assessments were invalid because the state's tax scheme was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose. The supreme court also reversed that portion of the trial court's opinion holding appellant's proposed tax assessments invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit originally brought by appellee magazine publishers against the Florida Department of Revenue challenging the constitutionality of the imposition of sales tax on retail sales of secular magazines pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 212.05(1)(i) and 212.08(7)(w), the United States Supreme Court remanded the case for further consideration after vacating the court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees magazine publishers brought suit against appellant state department of revenue challenging the constitutionality of a sales tax on sales of secular magazines pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 212.05(1)(i) and 212.08(7)(w). After the state supreme court affirmed the trial court's order finding that the statutes unconstitutionally burdened interests protected by U.S. Const. amend. I but held that the proper remedy was the elimination of the exemption from sales taxes for newspapers, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment and remanded the case. On remand, the court held that the tax did not discriminate either by singling out the press for a special tax or by targeting a small group within the press to bear the burden of the tax. However, the court held that the tax improperly discriminated on the basis of the content of the speech. The court held that, although the State had a legitimate interest in fostering literacy, the tax scheme was not narrowly tailored to achieve that end. The court therefore reversed the portion of the trial court's order regarding the proper remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's order holding that a sales tax imposed on sales of magazines violated First Amendment rights and did not serve a compelling state interest. However, the court reversed the portion of the trial court's order that concluded the appropriate remedy was to strike the tax imposed on magazines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From the Circuit Court in and for Martin County (Florida), defendant appealed his conviction for first-degree murder and the resulting death sentence after the judge rejected the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for first-degree murder and the resulting death sentence, despite the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment. The court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that defendant was not denied his right to cross-examination simply because the judge allowed a witness to testify anonymously. The court explained that because the defense always knew of the witness' identity, cross-examination was not hampered. The court further ruled that although the trial judge's jury instructions may have been error, the error was harmless and did not require reversal. Moreover, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting a photograph taken of the victim during an autopsy because it assisted the medical examiner in explaining the nature of the victim's wounds. Finally, as to the penalty phase, the court held that the record contained insufficient evidence to reasonably support the jury's recommendation of life. Thus, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in rejecting the life sentence and in imposing death, because the sentence was proportional to defendant's crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence. The court concluded that the trial court's evidentiary rulings were not an abuse of discretion and that although the trial judge's jury instructions may have been improper, any error was harmless. As to defendant's death sentence, the court held that the facts did not support a life sentence, thus the judge did not abuse his discretion in overriding the jury's recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified for review the questions of whether immunity from a personal injury suit existed for a general contractor who provided workers' compensation coverage for an independent contract and whether orders denying immunity from civil suit under Fla. Stat. ch. 440 et seq. might be reviewed by a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury action by petitioner independent contractor against respondents, a general contractor and an employee, the trial court denied respondents' summary judgment motion and respondents filed a petition for review. The district court treated the petition as a writ of prohibition, quashed the trial court's ruling, and certified for review the questions of whether a general contractor has immunity from personal injury where it provided workers' compensation coverage for an independent contractor and whether a writ of prohibition was the appropriate vehicle for review. The court approved the district court's decision as to the summary judgment motion, quashed the order granting prohibition, and remanded for dismissal. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.04, a general contractor was immune from civil liability where it obtained, by agreement, workers' compensation insurance for the independent contractor; despite the fact that independent contractors are generally excluded from coverage under Fla. Stat. ch. 440 et seq. The court ruled that a writ of prohibition could not be used to divest a court of jurisdiction, and the court revised Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(a)(3) to reflect this.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner land owners applied for review of the affirmative decision in favor of respondent land surveyor by the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), which certified as a question of great public importance regarding whether a land surveyor was a professional for purposes of the professional malpractice statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner land owners sued respondent land surveyor for malpractice for a negligent land survey slightly more than two years after discovering the error. Respondent raised as an affirmative defense the two-year statute of limitations for professional malpractice, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4). The sole issue presented to the court was whether land surveyors were &quot;professionals&quot; for purposes of the professional malpractice statute. The legislature had declined to define the term. The court's first-blush inclination was to strike the statute on the grounds of vagueness, but decided that an earlier opinion foreclosed that action. The court accepted jurisdiction to modify and clarify the earlier opinion. As now defined by the court, a &quot;profession&quot; in the context of the professional malpractice statute came into being when state licensing for all future admittees required a four-year undergraduate or graduate degree and not when any alternative method of admission was permitted. Because some land surveyors could be admitted to practice their occupation without a four-year degree, respondent was not a &quot;professional&quot; under the professional malpractice statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because some land surveyors could be admitted to practice their occupation without at least a four-year undergraduate degree, the court answered in the negative the certified question regarding whether a land surveyor was a professional for purposes of the professional malpractice statute. The opinion under review was quashed and the cause was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder. The trial court imposed sentences of death and life imprisonment. The convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. Petitioner filed for a writ of habeas corpus and a motion to vacate conviction and sentence pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The trial court denied the motion for postconviction relief. On appeal, the court barred petitioner's contentions that the murders were not cold, calculated, and premeditated, and that the trial court's instructions concerning aggravating factors conflicted with state law. For the same reason, the court barred petitioner's arguments concerning capital sentencing. The court also rejected petitioner's claims relating to ineffective assistance of counsel. In reviewing the habeas corpus petition, the court declined to retroactively apply case law concerning contemporaneous conviction. The court stated that the trial court was not required to use special jury forms for jury specification of the murder conviction, and the court again rejected petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision that denied petitioner's motion for postconviction relief was denied because some of petitioner's contentions were procedurally barred, and his claims relating to ineffective assistance of counsel were rejected. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus was also denied because there was no trial court error and the court declined to retroactively apply case law concerning contemporaneous conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a prisoner who participated in a work-release program, failed to report back to prison in the evening; petitioner was thus listed as &quot;escaped.&quot; Petitioner was later apprehended and was found guilty. At his sentencing hearing, the state introduced evidence of petitioner's prior convictions for two counts of aggravated assault, among other convictions. The trial court found petitioner to be a violent habitual felony offender, and sentenced him as such. Petitioner filed for review, arguing that the violent habitual felony offender statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(b), was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court held that it was plausible for the legislature to have included aggravated assault in its list of felonies considered as violent and thus warranting enhanced sentencing. Moreover, there was nothing irrational about the statute's focus on an offender's prior record because the state was justified in enhancing an offender's present penalty of a nonviolent crime based on an extensive or violent criminal history. The statute was also held as being specific as to the requirements necessary for habitual offender status. The decision below was approved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's affirmance of the enhancement of petitioner's sentence under a habitual felony offender statute was approved, because the statute was held to be constitutional. The court found that it plausible for the legislature to have deemed aggravated assault as a violent felony, that petitioner was a habitual offender, and that the statute was specific as to the requirements for a trial court's finding of habitual offender status.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 83.12 was unconstitutional on its face because it violated the U.S. Const. amend. XIV guarantee to due process of the law. Appellant had filed suit against appellee tenant, alleging breach of a lease agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord leased a restaurant to appellee tenant. After appellee failed to pay timely rent, appellant filed a two count verified complaint, and the trial court issued a distress writ pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 83.11 and 83.12 (1989). The sheriff served the writ on appellee, and appellee moved to exclude food and alcohol from the writ so that the restaurant could continue operation. The court denied the motion. On appeal, the district court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 83.12 was unconstitutional because it failed to provide discretion to the presiding judge. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed, finding that the statute was constitutional because it provided sufficient procedural safeguards to protect a debtor's interest. The statute provided for judicial authorization of the writ, for issuance of the writ only after the allegation of specific facts, for a bond to be posted, for an opportunity for the debtor to dissolve the writ, and for a prompt hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal, Third District, Dade County (Florida), certified a question following its judgment in favor of appellant lessor declaring Fla. Stat. ch. 718.4015&nbsp;unconstitutional: Was an escalation clause in a condominium recreation lease that was entered into before 1975 enforceable after October 1, 1988, for the entire term of a 99-year lease, where the lessor had not agreed to be bound by future changes in the Condominium Act?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision in which the lower court granted judgment to appellee lessor by expressly declaring Fla. Stat. ch. 718.4015&nbsp;unconstitutional. The lower court certified the following question: Was an escalation clause in a condominium recreation lease that was entered into before 1975 enforceable after October 1, 1988, for the entire term of the 99-year lease, where the lessor had not agreed to be bound by future changes in the Condominium Act? The court answered in the affirmative. The retroactive application of the predecessor to &sect; 718.4015 violated the contract clauses of the state and federal constitutions. A law was presumed valid until it was declared unconstitutional. Until ch. 718.4015 was declared unconstitutional, it was valid, and the escalation clause was void for public policy. Therefore, appellant condominium association's nonperformance of the escalation clause was excused. The award of attorney fees to appellee lessee was reversed because they resulted from an effort to have a law declared unconstitutional, and the parties' contractual provisions for payment of litigation costs did not include such costs or appeal costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part and observed that a law was presumed to be valid until it was declared unconstitutional. Therefore, appellant lessor's nonperformance of the escalation clause until a statute was declared unconstitutional was excused, and appellant was not liable for appellee lessee's costs and attorney fees associated with the action to have the statute declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), entering defendant's resentence of death following his convictions for first-degree murder, kidnapping, and involuntary sexual battery. Defendant claimed, inter alia, the trial court erred in admitting a witness's prior testimony, denying a motion to strike the jury panel, admitting defendant's prior inconsistent testimony, and in imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for first-degree murder, kidnapping, and involuntary sexual battery were upheld because a witness's prior testimony and defendant's prior inconsistent testimony were properly admitted, the jury panel was properly retained, the admission of victim photographs was harmless error, and the death penalty was properly imposed. Defendant pled to first-degree murder. The death penalty was imposed. Defendant appealed and argued that the trial court improperly rejected mitigating circumstances. The appellate court reversed and remanded for a resentencing. Defendant was resentenced to death. Defendant appealed. The state supreme court affirmed. The supreme court held that because plaintiff, the state, showed that the witness was unavailable, and defendant cross-examined her at a prior trial, the testimony was admissible. Because the state was rebutting a defense, use of defendant's prior inconsistent testimony was proper. The use of victim autopsy photographs was harmless error because other photographs supported the finding that the murder was committed in a cruel manner. Because evidence of a heinous murder existed, the death penalty was upheld.</SPAN></P>

The admission of victim autopsy photos and the finding of premeditation were harmless errors because the evidence showed the murder was heinous. The use of prior testimony at a second trial was upheld because the witness was unavailable, and defendant cross-examined the witness at the prior trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juveniles brought a writ of prohibition in the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) claiming that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.048 (1991) granted them an absolute substantive right to be tried within 90 days. Petitioners alleged that Fla. R. Juv. P. 8.090, which allowed the state an extra 10 days to bring petitioners to trial, did not apply. Petitioners sought dismissal of their cases because they were not tried within the statutory period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juveniles' cases were not dismissed because Fla. R. Juv. P. 8.090 took precedence over the speedy trial statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 39.048 (1991), and no speedy trial violations occurred. Petitioner juveniles' delinquency cases were scheduled for adjudicatory hearings beyond the statutory speedy trial period. Petitioners brought motions to dismiss. The trial court denied the motions. Petitioners brought a writ of prohibition, alleging that the statute created a substantive right and that the procedural rule violated the state constitution's separation of powers clause. The district court certified the cases to the supreme court. The supreme court denied the writ, holding that the speedy trial statute was merely a triggering mechanism that created a presumption of prejudice. Violation of the statute alone did not per se prejudice a juvenile's ability to defend himself or herself. Because the legislature did not intend to expand a juvenile's speedy trial right, the supreme court concluded that the procedural rule took precedence over the statute. Thus, dismissal was inappropriate where the savings clause of Fla. R. Juv. P. 8.090 applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court denied petitioner juveniles' petition for a writ of prohibition and upheld the trial court's denial of their motions to dismiss their juvenile delinquency petitions with prejudice. A procedural savings rule applied and no speedy trial violations occurred. A violation of the statute alone did not per se violate a juvenile's rights. The right was a procedural one that did not enjoy a higher level of constitutional protection.</SPAN></P>

The state could secure forfeiture of the interest of the person involved in criminal activity, but ch. 932.703(2) was to be interpreted to protect the interest of innocent co-owners from forfeiture.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of his convictions of first-degree murder and armed robbery and the imposition of the death penalty. In affirming, the court determined that the trial court did not err in limiting appellant's voir dire by prohibiting him from questioning potential jurors as to their willingness to sentence appellant differently than a codefendant found to be equally or less culpable, since appellant's counsel had sufficient latitude to question the jurors to obtain fair and impartial jurors. Likewise, the court found the trial judge did not err in imposing the death sentence when the sentencing jury indicated that appellant was less culpable than codefendant sentenced to life imprisonment. The court held that the trial court's responses to jury questions did not result in the jury's not knowing it could consider the codefendant's sentence as nonstatutory mitigating evidence during the penalty phase. The jury instructions, coupled with the closing arguments by both parties and the nature of the questions asked by the jury, indicated that the relative culpability of the codefendant was in the minds of the jurors and properly considered in recommending the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was charged with first-degree murder. A county administrative order divided the county into two separate districts for the purpose of drawing petit juries. The petitioner filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment because the grand jury had not been summoned from the same geographical area as the petit jury. Several years later, the court determined that the county administrative order was unconstitutional because it systematically excluded a significant portion of the black population. The petitioner sought postconviction relief but the trial court denied relief. The petitioner filed an appeal. The court held that had the petitioner failed to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the jury pool at trial and on direct appeal, he would not be entitled to relief. The petitioner's statutory challenge to the grand jury could not be equated to the constitutional claim regarding petit jury selection upon which relief was previously granted. The court approved the decision of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court rejected appellant's contention that Florida's death penalty procedure was unconstitutional because it did not require the sentencing jury to report in detail what decisions it reached with respect to each of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The court determined that no constitutional or statutory requirement mandated the use of a special verdict form in death penalty cases. The court also held that the prosecutor's references to the victim as a police officer were not improper and did not deny appellant due process in his sentencing proceeding, since this information was a part of the factual situation and was critical for the state to establish the aggravating circumstance of hindering the enforcement of laws under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(g)(1981). The court found appellant's claim of prejudice in the instruction of the jury with regard to similar aggravating factors was without merit because the instruction did not have a doubling effect. The court summarily rejected appellant's remaining claims as without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed an application for review of the decision of the District Court of Appeal, First District, Leon County (Florida), wherein the district court upheld the constitutionality of 1988 Fla. Laws ch. 88-238, which provided increased retirement benefits for special risk members of the Florida Retirement System. In upholding the statute, the district court construed Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed 1988 Fla. Laws ch. 88-238, which funded increases in the retirement benefits of special risk members of the Florida Retirement System. It provided for the increased benefits in five steps and required that public employers make increased contributions for each of the corresponding increases in benefits. Petitioners sought a declaration that chapter 88-238 was unconstitutional as an improper exercise of the taxing and spending power of the state under Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 14. The district court upheld the constitutionality of chapter 88-238. It also construed Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 14. Petitioners filed an application for review. The issue was whether the legislature was able to constitutionally enact a law providing for five consecutive annual retirement benefit increases and require the governmental unit responsible to fund each increase in the year in which it was implemented. The supreme court adopted the opinion of the district court. &quot;Sound actuarial basis,&quot; as contained in art. X, &sect; 14, meant that a retirement program was to be funded in such a way that the retirement fund was able to meet its continuing obligations as and when they matured.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for appellee, stating that the statute pledged public credit without a definitive public purpose. Appellant state government challenged the decision. The court found that the statute was not a pledge of public credit because there was no public liability incurred when appellee disbursed support payment checks before receiving payment on those funds. The depository account contained sufficient funds to disburse support payments paid by personal check. The legislature established a trust fund that could reimburse returned checks paid for child support. The court further found that the legislature acted pursuant to the strong public purpose of providing spouses and children with prompt support payments.

Respondent administered a no-fault system to insure against certain types of neurological injuries suffered by infants at birth. To fund respondent, all physicians were required to pay a mandatory annual assessment. Petitioners argued that the assessments against them were unconstitutional because they derived no benefit from it greater than did the general public. A trial court and an appellate court rejected petitioners' claims. On appeal, the court found that the assessment under Fla. Stat. ch. 766.314 was a tax because the assessment was levied upon physicians to support a governmental enterprise. The court concluded that there was a rational basis for the statutory assessment of all physicians, even though they did not practice obstetrics. Ensuring the availability of obstetrical services benefited all physicians, including petitioners, to a greater degree than the general public benefited. The court held that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a sting operation, petitioner was charged with trafficking in cocaine, conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, and obstructing an officer. Petitioner raised entrapment as an affirmative defense and asked the trial court to give the former standard instruction on entrapment, which stated that respondent state had the burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant was not entrapped. Instead, the trial court gave the current instruction, which stated that a defendant had the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entrapped. Petitioner was convicted of the trafficking and obstruction charges. The lower court affirmed and certified the question of whether Fla. Std. Jury Instructions 3.04(c)(2) (Crim.) and Fla. Stat. ch. 777.201(2) (1989), both applicable to offenses after 1987, unconstitutionally shifted the burden to the defense to prove entrapment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant seller appealed from the judgment of the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida), which (a) reversed an award of attorney's fees made under Fla. Stat. ch. 45.061 (1987), after summary judgment was entered against plaintiff motorist, following his rejection of defendant's settlement offer in an insurance subrogation action, and (b) ruled that &sect; 45.061 violated the judiciary's rule-making authority under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorist's insurer paid his claim for damage to his vehicle resulting from an accident with another car. Thereafter, on behalf of his insurer, plaintiff brought a subrogation action against the other driver and defendant seller, whom he thought was the owner of the other car. Defendant was granted summary judgment on evidence that she had sold the car to the other driver two months before the accident. Defendant was also awarded attorney's fees, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 45.061 (1987), because plaintiff had rejected defendant's earlier offer to settle for one dollar. The appellate court reversed, upon ruling that &sect; 45.061 violated separation-of-powers principles in that its procedural provisions encroached upon the judiciary's rule-making authority under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(a). Defendant appealed. In reversing, the court ruled that &sect; 45.061 was constitutional because the objectionable procedural provisions were superseded by Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442. In addition, the procedural aspects of &sect; 45.061 were severable from the substantive right under the statute to recover attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying attorney's fees was reversed because the statute under which the award was made was not an unconstitutional encroachment by the legislature upon judicial authority, even though it had procedural aspects, since those procedural aspects were superseded by judicial rule and were otherwise severable from language creating a substantive right to recover attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his first-degree murder and sentence of death on many grounds. In the guilt phase the court allowed two detectives to testify, over objection, that the victim was adamant about prosecuting appellant for indecent exposure. Appellant argued that what the victim thought and said about prosecuting him was inadmissible hearsay. Appellee State of Florida argued that the statements were used to prove that appellant had a motive to kill the victim. The court agreed that the statements were hearsay but found the admission to be harmless error. The court found the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction and affirmed the conviction. Appellant argued that during the penalty phase, the court should have halted the proceedings and conducted a competency hearing rather than ruling that appellant had absented himself voluntarily and continuing. The court found that prior to the suicide attempt, appellant's conduct gave no indication that his competency might be of concern, and his attempted suicide surprised everyone connected with the case. Thus, there were no reasonable grounds to question his competency. The court affirmed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder because the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction and it was not error to continue in the penalty phase without appellant present.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's aircraft was seized by authorities pursuant to appellant state's law prohibiting possession of extra fuel tanks that did not comply with federal aircraft regulations. However, appellee argued that appellant's law mandating forfeiture of such a non-complying aircraft was unconstitutional. Examining the statute at issue, the court first held that the statute's prohibition of additional fuel tanks that did not comply with federal regulations was a constitutional exercise of appellant's police power in preserving public safety. However, the court held that requiring the forfeiture of such noncomplying planes exceeded appellant's police power because the punishment was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to the objective of flight safety. The court reasoned that, in light of the state constitution's protection of property rights, the statute at issue was unreasonable. As a result, the court upheld the trial court's decision dismissing appellant's petition for forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that the proposed amendment met the single-subject requirement because it had a logical and natural oneness of purpose. The sole subject of the proposed amendment was limiting the number of consecutive terms that certain elected public officers could serve. The court held that although the proposed amendment affected officeholders in three branches of government, that fact alone was not sufficient to invalidate the proposed amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case concerning the admissibility of a dying declaration against petitioner, the District Court of Appeal, Fourth District (Florida), certified the question of whether a district court of appeal had certiorari jurisdiction to review an order granting a defendant's motion in limine filed prior to trial but not actually ruled on until trial commenced, where such order posed potentially irreparable harm to the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a pretrial motion in limine to prohibit introducing and referring to a declaration, claiming that the victim's statement did not qualify as a dying declaration. At trial, the judge excluded the declaration because he found the statute authorizing admission of dying declarations unconstitutional. During a temporary recess, respondent state filed its petition for certiorari to the district court and obtained a stay of the trial. On remand from the district court the trial resumed, using the dying declaration, and petitioner was acquitted. Hence, petitioner had no personal interest in the review. The court found that the district court did not have jurisdiction to take the action that it did, and the court declined to extend the right of certiorari to rulings in criminal cases made after jeopardy had attached even though such rulings were predicated on motions filed prior to trial, thus answering the certified question in the negative. The court found that the trial judge wrongly excluded the dying declaration, and wrongly found the law allowing such evidence unconstitutional, and adopted the district court's discussion on the law of dying declarations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee foster children sought declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant administration commission members. The action stemmed from the state's determination of a general revenue shortfall in the budget requiring state agencies to prepare revised financial plans reducing their current operating budgets. The trial court granted appellees' request, held Fla. Stat. ch. 216.011(1)(ll) and 216.221 to be unconstitutional, and enjoined appellants from attempting to restructure an appropriations act, 1991 Fla. Laws ch. 91-193, &sect; 1, pursuant to the budget reduction procedure established in Fla. Stat. ch. 216. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the statutes,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 216.011(1)(ll) and 216.221, were unconstitutional as a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers because the statutes were an impermissible attempt by the legislature to abdicate a portion of its lawmaking responsibility and to vest it in an executive entity, resulting in the powers of both the legislative and executive branches lodged in one body. This concentration of power was prohibited by the tripartite system of constitutional democracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant procured an assault rifle, shotgun, pistol, and ammunition. He then went on a shooting rampage, killing six people, including two police officers, and injuring 10 others. Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and numerous lesser offenses. He was sentenced to death for killing the two police officers. Appellant claimed that a new trial was necessary based on trial errors. The court affirmed the convictions because the state's failure to disclose psychiatric evidence did not violate appellant's due process rights because the experts had not interviewed appellant or formed an opinion about his sanity. Also, the trial court did not err by refusing to allow cross-examination of a state expert based on immateriality, and the insanity jury instruction was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's convictions for murder and lesser offenses because the trial court did not err by failing to allow cross-examination of the state's expert witness or surrebuttal evidence based on relevancy. The state's psychiatric evidence was properly not disclosed because it was immaterial. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion and a new trial was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner dentist sought review of the decision of the Fourth District Court of Appeal, Broward County (Florida), which reversed summary judgment in favor of petitioner in a medical malpractice action and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions that respondent patient was allowed to amend his complaint to allege that notice was filed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.57(3)(a) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the appellate court's decision and remanded the action with directions to reinstate the trial court's judgment. Respondent patient filed suit against petitioner dentist alleging medical malpractice, but respondent failed to file the notice required by Fla. Stat. ch. 768.57(3)(a) (1985). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of petitioner. The appellate court reversed and remanded with instructions to allow respondent to amend his complaint to allege compliance with the notice requirement. On review based on a conflict of decisions, the court found that compliance with the pre-filing notice of ch. 768.57 was a condition precedent to maintaining an action for malpractice and, while it may be complied with after the filing of the complaint, the notice must be given within the statute of limitations. The court rejected respondent's argument that the notice requirement was procedural and, as such, was an unconstitutional invasion of the court's exclusive rule-making authority. The statute was intended to address a legitimate legislative policy decision related to medical malpractice actions and to promote settlement of meritorious claims at an early stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Broward County Circuit Court (Florida), convicting him of kidnapping and first-degree murder and sentencing him to consecutive life and death sentences, respectively, upon the finding of three aggravating factors and no mitigating factors, even though the jury recommended a life sentence only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dead woman was found nude with her hands bound by duct tape, which also covered her mouth and neck. When defendant was questioned by police, he initially denied any involvement, but later said the woman was killed accidentally when he tried to loosen tape that her boyfriend and his employer had put around her neck during sex. At trial, he claimed the woman accidentally died because of erotic sexual asphyxia during consensual sex with defendant. A pathologist testified that the victim's injuries were consistent with both erotic sexual asphyxia and strangulation. Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and first-degree murder. Despite the jury recommending life imprisonment, he was sentenced to death for the murder, upon a finding of three aggravators with no mitigators, with a consecutive life sentence for the kidnapping. Defendant appealed. In affirming the convictions and the kidnapping sentence, the court ruled, inter alia, that they were supported by substantial credible evidence. In vacating the death sentence, the court ruled that it was improper to override the jury's recommendation because it had a reasonable basis, given mitigating evidence that was presented.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both convictions and sentence for the kidnapping were affirmed because, inter alia, they were supported by competent substantial evidence, to the exclusion of defendant's claim of accidental death, and the life sentence was not improper. The death sentence was reversed because the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment had a reasonable basis in the record, which the trial court could not properly override.</SPAN></P>

The court found that several of the grounds lacked merit or had already been rejected by the court. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in finding him competent to stand trial because one of the three experts appointed to examine him testified that in his opinion appellant was incompetent. Although this doctor testified that appellant was not competent to stand trial because he suffered from delusional thought processes, two other doctors testified that appellant was competent. The court concluded that it was the trial court's responsibility to resolve disputed factual issues. The record contained sufficient evidence to show that appellant understood the charges against him and could assist in his defense. The court affirmed appellant's convictions and sentence. The court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled on the issue of competency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court, Orange County (Florida), which imposed the death penalty upon defendant in a resentencing hearing subsequent to convicting defendant of murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant was originally sentenced to death for a murder he committed, a new sentencing hearing was ordered. However, defendant received the death penalty in the second sentencing hearing as well. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to waive the jury sentencing recommendation. The court noted that the trial court implied it would lessen its reliance on the jury's recommendation if it found the recommendation was improperly influenced by knowledge of defendant's prior death sentence. As a result, the court upheld the refusal to waive the recommendation. The court then held the prosecution's reference to defendant's prior death sentence was improper, but was inadvertent and its impact was negligible, because the jury likely knew of the earlier sentence. Thus, the court held the trial court did not err in refusing to grant a mistrial for the statement. Reviewing the record, the court also held that the trial court acted within its discretion in refusing to apply the mitigating factors argued by defendant because the evidence did not clearly support the application of the factors. Thus, the court upheld imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The imposition of the death penalty in defendant's resentencing hearing was affirmed because the trial court's refusal to apply statutory mitigating factors argued by defendant was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court vacated appellant's death sentence because of the mitigating circumstances. Applying the principle that the reasons present in one case will reach a similar result to that reached under similar circumstances in another case, the court determined that the one statutory aggravating factor did not outweigh the unrefuted mitigating factors. Thus, the court reduced appellant's sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for twenty-five years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of first degree murder, burglary, and battery on a police officer, argued that appellee state, during jury selection, unconstitutionally exercised a peremptory challenge for racial reasons. The court agreed, ruling that appellee's challenge of a venire member who was black, because he might identify with a black defendant, was unjustifiable. The challenge's alternative basis, that the venire member shared no eye contact with appellant, was pretextual. Moreover, it was reversible error for the trial court to deny appellant's motion to sever the murder and burglary charges from the battery charge because the latter was not episodically connected to the former and involved different victims, offenses, dates, places, and circumstances. Also, the consciousness-of-guilt from flight instruction given to the jury during the trial's guilt phase was improper in the absence of supporting evidence. Finally, the court's override of the jury's recommendation of life imprisonment was error, for reasonable mitigating factors--alcohol abuse and remorse--supported this recommendation, and the court ruled that double jeopardy barred imposition of the death penalty on retrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting appellant of murder, burglary, and battery on a police officer, and sentencing him to death, was reversed and remanded because peremptory challenge of venire member was racially based, because severance of murder and burglary charges, from the battery charge, was required for episodically unconnected charges, and because override of recommended life sentence was improper given the reasonable basis for jury's recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was convicted of first-degree and second-degree murder, attempted murder, grand theft, and burglary. He was tried together with his codefendant. The state introduced evidence concerning the commission of the murders in the victims' home. Victims' daughters testified that they recognized defendant's voice because he had been their neighbor. Both defendants were found guilty and sentenced. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant was not entitled to severance from codefendant because he was not prejudiced by any testimony admitted. The state did not enter codefendant's confession, and evidence of codefendant's history of violent behavior was inadmissible. Also, defendant's motion for witnesses' expenses was properly denied because he did not prove experts would be of assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A court issued an advisory opinion to the attorney general regarding the validity of an initiative petition circulated by a corporation. The court permitted briefs to be filed by interested parties and heard oral arguments on the subject. The initiative petition sought to add a homestead valuation limitation to Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4. The court found that the provision complied with the single-subject requirement under Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3, which provided that a proposed amendment had to have a logical and natural oneness of purpose. The court next had to determine whether the proposed ballot title and substance complied with Fla. Stat. ch. 101.161, which required that the ballot and title had to be fair and advise the voter sufficiently to enable him to intelligently cast his ballot. Although the court stated the ballot summary could have been drafted more broadly to explain the increase in homestead property valuation, overall the summary fairly reflected the chief purpose of the proposed amendment. Therefore, the court found the initiative petition and proposed ballot summary met the requirements of Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3 and Fla. Stat. ch. 101.16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases petitioner lessees sought review of the decisions of the Third District Court of Appeal, Dade County (Florida) that granted summary judgment to respondent lessors and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021(9)(b) (1987), which concerned a long-term motor vehicle lessor's financial responsibility for the operation of that vehicle, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021(9)(b) (1987). Chapter 324.021(9)(b) provided that the lessor of a motor vehicle for a period in excess of one year was not liable under the dangerous instrumentality doctrine for damages resulting from the operation of that vehicle provided that the lessee maintained the requisite minimum insurance coverage. The court rejected petitioner lessees' contention that ch. 324.021(9)(b) was unconstitutional based on access to courts, equal protection, and due process violations. The statute did not irrationally distinguish between lessees injured by vehicles leased for a period in excess of one year and lessees injured by vehicles leased for a period of less than one year. The court found that there was a rational basis for ch. 324.021(9)(b), which simply redefined &quot;owner&quot; of a motor vehicle so as to exclude a long-term lessor upon satisfaction of the statutory preconditions. The statute did not discriminate against lessees suffering the worst injuries by eliminating possible recovery from the lessor in view of the unlimited ability to recover from the lessee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgments in favor of respondent lessors of motor vehicles were approved. Respondents were not liable under the dangerous instrumentality doctrine for damages resulting from the operation of leased vehicles because the lessees maintained the requisite minimum insurance coverage and had leased the cars for more than one year.

Appellant sought review of the judgment on many grounds. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in permitting the Chief Medical Examiner to testify regarding the cause of death and the condition of the victim's body because she did not perform the autopsy, nor was the autopsy report admitted into evidence. Appellant contended that Appellee State of Florida failed to lay a proper foundation for her testimony. The court was satisfied that a proper predicate for her testimony was established because an expert, under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.704, could rely on facts or data not in evidence in forming an opinion if those facts were of a type reasonably relied upon by experts. The expert relied on several reports and photographs of the body. The court affirmed the convictions and sentence of death. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him for burglary without regard to a sentencing guidelines scoresheet. The court agreed and vacated the sentence for burglary and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping, sexual battery, aggravated battery, and burglary. His convictions and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 which the trial court denied. Defendant appealed that order and also sought habeas corpus relief. The court affirmed the denial of postconviction relief and denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant claimed that the prosecution failed to disclose a taped witness statement that supported defendant's claim of intoxication. The court said that defendant was aware of his own intoxication and was aware of evidence to support it. However, intoxication would not have been defense in the guilt phase of the trial and it was not a theory pursued by the defense. Furthermore, the withheld evidence was merely duplicative of other evidence of which defendant was aware. Counsel was not ineffective for choosing another theory of defense, identity, where the rejected theory would only have been relevant in the penalty phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court certified a case of great public importance seeking review of a case whereby the trial court held that amendments to the Comprehensive Economic Development Act of 1990 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayers and others and appellant various corporations and others disputed the constitutionality of amendments to the workers' compensation law. Appellees claimed that, because the cumulative effect of chapter 90-201 was to substantially reduce preexisting benefits to employees without providing any countervailing advantages, the workers compensation statute was no longer a reasonable alternative to common-law remedies and, therefore, violated the access to courts provision of the Florida constitution. The court rejected this claim. Although chapter 90-201 reduced benefits, the workers' compensation law remained a reasonable alternative to tort litigation. Appellees claimed that chapter 90-201 was facially unconstitutional because it violated the single subject requirement. Appellants contended that the workers' compensation and international trade subjects were logically related to the topic of comprehensive economic development. The court disagreed. The subjects were too dissimilar and lacked the necessary logical and rational relationship to the legislature's stated purpose of comprehensive economic development to pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that portion of the trial court's decision that declared chapter 90-201 facially unconstitutional for the single subject violation and that portion of the decision that rejected the contention that chapter 90-201 unconstitutionally denied access to courts. The court reversed the remainder of its decision.</SPAN></P>
