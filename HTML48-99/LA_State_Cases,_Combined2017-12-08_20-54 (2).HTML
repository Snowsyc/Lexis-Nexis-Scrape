</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Clerk of Court of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, and the Superintendent of the Division of the State Police, challenged the preliminary injunction issued by the trial court (Louisiana), which restrained the Clerk from destroying appellee owner's slot machines or delivering them to the Superintendent on the basis that 1928 La. Acts 231 was repealed by 1948 La. Acts 6, and that the former effected an unconstitutional taking of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court pointed out that the taxpayer's contention that 1948 La. Acts 6 repeals by implication 1928 La. Acts 231 was a matter of no consequence in the ultimate determination of the case for the reason that both acts were expressly repealed, and the substance of those acts was incorporated as part of the Revised Code of laws as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:375 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:26.1, respectively. When these provisions were embodied in the Revised Statutes, they stood on a parity with each other and, this being so, it was impossible to hold that one provision had the effect of repealing the other. Further, the design of the Louisiana State Legislature was explicit; by levying a tax on the illegal business of operating gambling slot machines, it was not intended to lift those devices from the category of contraband to the status of property capable of private ownership. Because there was no status of ownership recognized by law in the illegal gambling machines, there was no merit to the contention that by ordering the summary destruction of slot machines, &sect; 15:26.1 effected an unconstitutional taking of the owner's property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled and reversed the trial court's judgment, and the owner's suit was dismissed at his costs. The court further ordered the Clerk to deliver to the Superintendent, his agents and employees, the slot machines in his possession for destruction in accordance with the laws of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with advertising himself as an &quot;architect&quot; in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:3. Before trial, defendant sought inspection of the originals or copies of plans, drawings, and other documents that the State intended to offer in connection with prosecution of the case, and any written or oral statements, confessions, or admissions made by defendant. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the disclosure because an accused in a criminal case was without right to a pretrial inspection of the evidence on which the prosecution intended to rely for a conviction. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for a bill of particulars informing him whether the advertisements referred to in the information were written or oral and public and, if written, whether uses of the word &quot;architect&quot; was in defendant's handwriting. The information drawn in the language of the statute sufficiently informed defendant of the accusations against him to enable him to prepare for trial. The court also found no merit in defendant's contention that &sect; 37:3 was unconstitutionally vague, or in his other exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and its mayor and police chief, challenged a judgment of the district court (Louisiana), which enjoined it from enforcing a criminal ordinance by declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. Bogalusa, La., Ordinance No. 416, adopted as an emergency measure, provided for the licensing of itinerant vendors, regulated their sales of goods and merchandise, and stipulated penalties for violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee of plaintiff photography studio was arrested for violating Ordinance No. 416, which prohibited itinerant vendors from selling photographs in the city. On the day after the arrest, the studio instituted a civil action in the district court to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance and to obtain a decree that it was unconstitutional. The district court restrained the city from proceeding with enforcement of the ordinance. Defendants moved to dissolve the restraining order, urging various grounds. The district court decreed that the ordinance was unconstitutional and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. On appeal, the court noted that the ordinance was an exercise of the city's police powers. Because of the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the court found that the district court, proceeding as a court of equity, was without jurisdiction to prevent by injunction the enforcement of a criminal ordinance. Further, the court found that an injunction could not be issued because the studio was not threatened with irreparable injury against which the law afforded no adequate remedy. Thus, the court reversed the judgment of the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was reversed and set aside, the exceptions of no right and no cause of action were sustained, and the studio's suit was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), which convicted him of obscenity. The bill of information charged that he was in possession of indecent prints and pictures intended for sale. Defendant contended that the information charged him under the old law containing language from 1942 La. Acts 43, which was insufficient to charge him with obscenity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106, as amended by 1950 La. Acts 314.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with obscenity one day after the state legislature amended the obscenity statute to include the requirement that the possession of any indecent picture be lewd, lascivious, or sexually indecent. Defendant pleaded guilty to a bill of information charging only that he was in possession of indecent prints and pictures intended for sale. Defendant filed no formal objection to the bill of information. On defendant's appeal, the State argued that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:253, the information would have been amended if requested by motion, and any error had been waived. The court rejected the argument. Noting that it could review the record for patent error, the court found the information deficient because it only charged defendant with conduct under the old statute, 1942 La. Acts 43, which had since been amended to include an additional element. The court annulled defendant's conviction and sentence, finding that defendant had in effect pleaded guilty to conduct that was no longer a crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen filed an action seeking to restrain defendants, the mayor and city council of New Orleans, from conducting an investigation of the police department. The trial court (Louisiana) granted the preliminary injunction and denied defendants' request for a suspensive appeal. Defendants then applied for writs of certiorari, asking the court to compel the trial court to grant a suspensive appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were conducting an investigation into the police department pursuant to a city charter provision, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:2491 et seq. They argued that they were entitled to a suspensive appeal from the preliminary injunction, without providing a bond, based on the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:4431, 13:4432. Agreeing, the court held that the object of the suit was purely to restrain defendants from the performance of duties which they contended they had the right, under the city charter, to perform. The trial court considered that this provision of the charter was unconstitutional. However, until the court finally passed upon the question of the constitutionality of that section, the trial court had no right to prevent defendants' investigation by means of injunction. Additionally, the trial court should have granted defendants a suspensive appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator filed an application seeking an order commanding that the Twenty Fifth Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Bernard (Louisiana) grant him a suspensive appeal from its judgment that restrained him from destroying tow certain slot machines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sought a suspensive appeal contending that he was entitled to it as a matter of right under La. Rev. Stat.

The court denied the application and held that &sect; 13:4431 was not intended to apply to a case where the granting of a suspensive appeal would have the effect of restoring to relator the right of destroying the articles and render the issue moot before it could be heard in the appellate court. Although La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:26.1 made it mandatory for officers to immediately confiscate gambling devices, the restraint of relator from performing that obligation during the pendency of the appeal, where the constitutionality of the statute was challenged, was not such an interference with relator in the pursuant of his duties as to affect the orderly operation of his office. As such, it did not warrant the application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4431. Moreover, the trial court informed the court that it would retain possession of the machines until the issue was finally decided, thereby preserving the status quo.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the railroad's lack of common carrier certification was not dispositive of its right of expropriation. Instead, the court held that the right was governed by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2630, and that the railroad had established that the expropriation was necessary and that it was for public, not private use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Louisiana Public Service Commission, the Village of Harahan, and the Police Jury of Jefferson Parish, appealed a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which had ruled in favor of plaintiff, a railroad, and enjoined the Commission from enforcing its order to the railroad, under the police power of the State, to construct and maintain a highway across certain of its tracks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission had cited the railroad to show cause why it should not be required to install, construct, and maintain a highway over certain tracks. The Commission overruled the railroad's objection and ordered it to construct a road over its right of way. The railroad sued to enjoin the Commission from enforcing its order on the grounds that its action was illegal in that it constituted a taking of its property without just compensation, and that the order was issued arbitrarily, without regard to the facts and without sufficient evidence to support it. The trial court found that the Commission was without jurisdiction to render the order and granted a permanent injunction. The Commission contended that its authority to issue the order was from La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4, vesting it with plenary power to supervise, regulate, and control all common carrier railroads, and also by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45:841. The court reversed and found the language of &sect; 45:841 to be explicit. By its plain terms, it imposed on the Commission the duty of requiring railroads to construct and maintain suitable crossings over all public roads, which were to be constructed as well as to all others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Former property owners filed a suit that contended that a tax sale of property they claimed to have owned was an absolute nullity. The trial court rejected their claim and found in favor of defendant, the purchaser in the tax sale. On review, the court noted that the purchaser was a district and that, even if it did not have authority to acquire the property at the tax sale, the district had such authority subsequently granted to it by the Legislature when Acts 235 and 236 of 1936 ratified the purchase. According to the court, the legislation ratified, quieted, and confirmed the district's title. The court also concluded that these acts were public or general laws, and that therefore the constitutional prohibition in La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 4, dealing with local or special laws had no application. Finally, the court found that the description in the tax deed, when considered with the other relevant evidence, was sufficient to identify the property sold at the tax sale in 1921 as the same property described in the 1914 deed the former property owners claimed as their author in title.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that although the owner might be perfectly innocent of any offense, nevertheless, his property was guilty. Although the owner had entrusted the truck to an agent without authorizing the latter to use it to break the law, if thus used, the truck was subject to forfeiture. The guilt of the thing or property was entirely without reference to the its ownership. Under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer sought to have &sect; 22:391 be declared unconstitutional because it impaired the obligations of its charter contract that it had with the State of Louisiana and was, therefore, violative of both the State and Federal Constitutions. The court found that the attacked provision was passed in the exercise of the police power of the state. The court found that when the legislature enacted the provision it was by a power specifically conferred together with a commandment of the Constitution that said powers so exercised by the legislature would not be abridged. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment. It held that the facts clearly disclosed that there was no impairment of the obligation of the contract of the company but that the measure was a regulation as to the form of policy that the company must write in the future.</SPAN></P>

As a result of an advertisement defendant, an optician, was charged in a bill of information with violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1063(9). He filed a demurrer and a motion to quash, which were overruled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned an optical company.

In response to defendant's challenge as to the constitutionality of the statute, the court concluded that &sect; 37:1063(9) was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power, as it was reasonably related to the protection of the public and to public health concerns. Further, the court opined that the advertisement came within the meaning of the prohibition under &sect; 37:1063(9), on grounds that fitting glasses was determined to be an optometry service. Nor was defendant exempt from the statutory prohibition on such advertising.

In affirming the decision, the court held that after six months had elapsed from the promulgation of Act 46 of 1932, the act of the daughter's adoption was immune to attack. Section 13 of Act 46 of 1932 made manifest that a six-month period of peremption was intended and provided. Notwithstanding the validation, a right of action of limited duration was created. Further, &sect; 13 did not authorize the adoption of children without the consent of the natural parents; it merely validated any prior acts in which consent had not been obtained in writing, provided the interested parties failed to file suit to set such acts aside within six months from the promulgation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

This section was defined La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 22A, added by 1936 La. Acts 139, and was subject to ordinances passed by the Vieux Carre Commission regulating building in the area. Affirming the convictions, the court held that the language of the ordinance was not vague or ambiguous. The word &quot;theatres&quot; as used in the ordinance was readily understandable and sufficiently definite. The remaining mentioned words likewise were not vague and constituted adequate standards, when read in context. The words &quot;architectural and historical value&quot; and &quot;the quaint and distinctive character&quot; of the Vieux Carre were not subject to mistaken meanings. An amendment to the ordinance, New Orleans, La., Ordinance No. 16,430 (1946), which redefined the historic area, appeared to be without authority.

On appeal, the car owner attacked the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5363. The court of appeal ruled that lack of authentic evidence to support an order of foreclosure by executory process must be raised by an appeal from the order of seizure and sale and cannot be raised by a rule nisi for an injunction. On certiorari, the court held that the seized car owner had a remedy by injunction. The court noted that such remedy would give individuals an opportunity to redress a wrong. However, on the merits, the court held that the automobile financing company was entitled to use the executory process to enforce the car owner's obligation.

Defendants opposed the suit on the ground that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:365 was unconstitutional. The trial court gave judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Defendants appealed. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that the election of the candidate was a nullity and without effect under La. Const. art. 8, &sect; 15 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:365 where &sect; 18:365 disqualified the candidate from opposing or becoming a candidate in opposition to one named at a primary in which he had taken part. The court held that La. Const. art. 8, &sect; 15 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:365 were not in conflict and should have been construed harmoniously so as to have given effect to both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife married in Louisiana and established a domicile in Louisiana. One week later the wife moved back to Mississippi. After more than two years had passed the wife filed an action for divorce in Louisiana. The husband was personally served but did not appear. A preliminary default was entered. At the hearing to confirm the default the wife testified that she had been living in Mississippi and that the husband still lived in Louisiana. The trial court rendered judgment against the wife dismissing her action. The wife appealed. The court noted that although La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 9:301 stated that an action for divorce could be brought after the parties had lived apart for two years in the court of the party's residence, the general practice under La. Code Prac. art. 162 of suing a defendant at his domicile was still valid. The court held that regardless of the wife's residence in Mississippi, the district court was clearly vested with jurisdiction. The court held that satisfactory proof was made on confirmation of default which entitled the wife to judgment in her favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Department of Conservation issued an order setting forth a spacing pattern or compulsory drilling units for 160 acres of land, in which plaintiffs had an interest. In response to an application for reformation of the order by one of the plaintiffs, the Department issued a revised order. The order, however, did not grant the relief sought. Plaintiffs then filed an action alleging that the orders were capricious, arbitrary, unjust, and unconstitutional. The Commissioner argued that plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies. The trial court dismissed the action. In reversing the trial court's decision, the court held that, because the Department could continue forever to reform the original order, it would be very difficult to determine when an administrative remedy had been exhausted. The court held that, when plaintiff was refused the relief sought, his recourse was to the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of narcotics in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:962. In affirming the decision, the court held that defense counsel did not register an objection to the introduction of the gleanings in evidence or to any of the testimony concerning the same. Further, the court's refusal to give two special charges, one allegedly covering the subject of possession of marijuana and the other the definition of the drug, was disposed of adversely to defendant. Because counsel did not advance anything new and failed to point out error in the previous decision, further consideration of the bill was unnecessary. In addition, the requested charge was tantamount to a motion to quash the bill of information on the ground that it was sacramental to charge defendant in the language of the statute with possessing a narcotic drug, rather than with possessing marijuana, as was done. Finally, he judge correctly told the jury that the possession of marijuana was violative of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:961 and that, because marijuana was defined as a narcotic drug, a charge of possession of that specific drug sufficiently set forth an offense.</SPAN></P>

The appeals were transferred pursuant to La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 10, although the amount in dispute did not exceed $ 2000.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company alleged that insurance premiums were erroneously assessed as personal property in the nature of credits. The appellate court transferred the appeal because the legality of a tax was contested under the provision of La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 10 giving the court appellate jurisdiction over tax questions. The court held that the provision contemplated the court's entertaining appellate jurisdiction in cases where the amount involved did not exceed $ 2,000 for the restricted purpose of inquiring into the validity of the statute or ordinance imposing the tax. This meant that for jurisdiction to vest in the court it must be contended that the law levying the tax violated some constitutional requisite or that it otherwise had no legal existence, a mere claim could not be unconstitutional. The portion of the constitutional provision relating to penalties employed precisely the same language and it had been thus construed consistently and uniformly throughout our jurisprudence. No attack was made on the statute under which the ad valorem taxes were levied, and the amount involved did not exceed $ 2,000. The court, therefore, was without jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the information was invalid on the ground that an endorsement on the back of the information did not indicate that defendant was charged under an amendment that increased the penalty for violating &sect; 40:962. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was correct in overruling defendant's motion to quash the information because defendant was properly charged in the body of the information and the endorsement did not constitute a substantive part of the charge. Although capsules of seized heroin were not delivered to the clerk of court as required by Orleans Parish, La., Crim. Dist. Ct. R. 20, &sect; 1, the court determined that the violation of Rule 20, &sect; 1 did not render the seized property inadmissible. Because defendant admitted to possessing the heroin for his own use, the court ruled that there was no merit to defendant's complaint that the heroin was not properly identified. The court concluded that the senate committee that reported the amendment under which defendant was prosecuted was legally created because La. Const. of 1921, art. III, &sect; 10 authorized each house of the legislature to choose its own officers and to determine its rules of procedure.</SPAN></P>

The court then considered the legislative procedures leading up to the reporting by the legislative committee and held that under La Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court adopted the trial court's opinion. To the trial court, the issue of the case had been resolved by an earlier case in which it was decided that a proprietor was operating a drug store because a part of his general store was allocated to the display and sale of certain patented drugs that were commonly used by the public without a doctor's prescription. The trial court found that the drug-store owner in the case sub judice did not maintain a prescription department, but he did operate a bona fide drug store and come within the exception set forth in 1948 La. Acts 469, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1171 et seq.; apparently, the city sought a surrender of the liquor license on the basis that the owner's business was not a bona fide drug store. The owner had obtained the license via Shreveport, La. Ordinance 80 (1948), which provided for package sales of liquor in a bona fide drug store that had been in operation for one year. The trial court also ruled that the ordinance by which the surrender was sought, Shreveport, La.

Defendant contended that the state legislature, in enacting its gambling provisions, restricted by implication the authority of the city to enact lottery ordinances broader than &sect; 14:90. Affirming the conviction and sentence, the court held that the city's broad police powers, granted to it by 1912 La. Acts 159, &sect; 1(d) and (h), as amended by 1948 La. Acts 18, specifically allowed it to pass ordinances covering matters which the State had not fully regulated, as long as the ordinances did not directly conflict with the provisions of any state law upon the same subject matter. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the ordinance attempted to preclude the establishment of a corpus delicti because possession of lottery tickets or punch board chances was prima facie evidence of intent to sell or unlawfully dispose of the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant union, composed of the members of plaintiff city's fire department, complained of a declaratory judgment entered by the trial court (Louisiana), which held La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1994&nbsp;unconstitutional in that it delegated to the union the right to decide by a vote whether the members would work a maximum of 60 hours per week and, thus, to make laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city brought suit against the union, claiming that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1994 was unconstitutional in that the legislature, by vesting in the firefighters of the affected cities the right to change the maximum weekly working hours from 72 to 60, had surrendered to the individual groups its exclusive authority to legislate upon such police regulations. The court found that the legislature conferred upon the majority of firefighters in all such cities the right to change and amend the law. This was purely a legislative function that could not be delegated to any private group. The court held that the power conferred on the firefighters did not fit into any of the categories of permissive legislative delegation, and that &sect; 33:1994 was not, as the union contended, a case wherein the assailed provision could be upheld on the basis that it was legislation which merely became effective upon the happening of a specified event. This was legislative delegation in its most obnoxious form; it was not even delegation to an official or an official body, presumptively disinterested, but to private persons who might force the police regulation upon the taxpayers of the municipality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the trial court (Louisiana), which convicted him of unlawful possession of narcotics, in violation of 1934 La. Acts 14, as amended, the predecessor to the Uniform Narcotic Drug Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:961 et seq., and sentenced him to five years at hard labor. Prior to the state action, a federal court suppressed the evidence seized at defendant's arrest, and that prosecution was nolle prossed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant demurred to the indictment on the ground that he was granted a legislative pardon when Act 14, as amended, was specifically repealed upon the adoption of the revised statutes. The court held that, under &sect; 24:171, the repeal of any law did not release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under that law unless the repealing act expressly so provided, which &sect; 40:961 did not do. Also, defendant was not entitled to quash the indictment due to the federal charges because defendant was neither acquitted nor convicted in that action. Further, defendant was not entitled to suppress the evidence seized because the rule obtaining in Louisiana was that evidence seized without a search warrant when defendant was arrested was admissible during the trial. In the court's view, the prosecutor's characterization of defendant as a &quot;dope peddler&quot; was warranted by the evidence and was permissible in the State's closing argument. Finally, the trial court properly ruled that defendant was not entitled to a jury charge that the responsive verdicts included &quot;guilty of being an addict&quot; because that lesser offense did not include all of the elements of the greater offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each defendant was convicted of violating one of the provisions of the gambling ordinance, which had been adopted by the city council, and was sentenced to pay a fine of $ 10 or serve 10 days in jail. A motion to quash the affidavit on the basis of the alleged illegality, invalidity, and unconstitutionality of the ordinance for the violation of which they were being charged was overruled. Defendants admitted they were playing cards for money but said it was a &quot;friendly&quot; game, contending that their gambling was not &quot;as a business,&quot; as prohibited in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:90. The court reversed the judgment and set it aside. When the legislature removed from a municipality the power, which it had previously given to it, to define gambling, and itself passed a law specifically defining it, it intended to occupy the whole field of legislation on the subject and merely left the municipality with concurrent power to suppress it in the manner defined by that law. The city lacked the power to extend or enlarge the definition contained in &sect; 14:90 to include all gambling, whether for a business or not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a taxpayer of Rapides Parish, Louisiana, appealed the judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), in favor of defendant, the Rapides Parish (Louisiana) School Board, in the taxpayer's suit to enjoin the sale of bonds authorized by an election in which the voters ratified the consolidation of two school districts and in which the indebtedness of both districts was assumed by the consolidated district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the election, the Board adopted a resolution authorizing the sale of the remaining bonds under the original authorized bond issue in the first of the two school districts that had been merged into the consolidated district. The trial court maintained the Board's pleas of prescription and preemption, and dismissed the taxpayer's suit. On appeal, the court set aside the judgment and ordered that the Board be enjoined from selling, issuing, or delivering any part of the bonds. It reasoned that the taxpayers voted that the new district would assume &quot;all the outstanding bonded indebtedness&quot; of the two districts, and that the bonds, which were authorized but not issued by the first of the two formerly separate school districts, were not an outstanding bonded indebtedness and thus were not an obligation of the new district. It concluded that the residents and property owners of the portion of the new district composed of the former second separate district were well within their rights in opposing the sale of the bonds and the subjecting of their property to taxation toward the payment of the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was improperly convicted because as a condition precedent for support of an illegitimate child, there must either have been an acknowledgement of paternity or the child must have been declared to be his by judgment.

Setting aside the conviction, the court agreed that the State was required to prove that defendant was the father of the child in question. The court relied in part upon La. Civ.

The court rejected the argument that the scope of the concept of the practice of medicine as defined by the MPA had been markedly curtailed by 1932 La. Acts 91, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1111, which defined the practice of osteopathy to exclude from it chiropractors and others that treated by applying physical pressure. The court also rejected the contention that the MPA was unconstitutional; this contention posited that the MPA discriminated in favor of osteopaths, dentists, and optometrists legally licensed in their field in that they were exempt from the requirement of a medical license. The court pointed out that it had been determined in previous cases that the exemption from medical licensing was not discrimination against chiropractors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, State Board of Education, sought review of a decision of the district court (Louisiana), which granted a judgment in favor of plaintiff, a taxpayer, which held 1950 La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed 1950 La. Acts. 69 and 527, which related to the status of two colleges. The language in both laws was identical and with the exception of the names of the two colleges or institutions, their provisions were exactly the same. The laws allowed the name of the colleges to be changed from their existing names to names that indicated that they were State colleges; they also allowed the State Board to administer the affairs of the colleges, and to convey the site and facilities of the colleges to the State Board. 1905 La. Acts. 70 and 528 had the purpose of placing both of the colleges under the administration of the State Board. The taxpayer filed an action in which he alleged that the laws were repugnant to the law of the State as set out in La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 14. The lower court granted a judgment in favor of the taxpayer, which held that 1950 La. Acts. 69 and 527 were unconstitutional, null, and void, and as a consequence 1950 La. Acts. 70 and 528 were ineffective and inoperative. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the taxpayer failed to prove that the laws violated La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case dealt with the constitutionality of Act 365 of 1946, which authorized a particular individual to sue the Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans. The trial court found that the legislation violated La. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 because it failed to specify the effect of the judgment to be rendered. The trial court sustained defendant's exception of no right or cause of action, and dismissed the suit, because the enactment did not provide for the effect of the judgment to be rendered. Initially the court on review reversed the judgment. A rehearing was granted and, on reconsideration, the court affirmed the trial court judgment. According to the court, the legislation clearly did not include even a line or scintilla of expression that related to the effect of a judgment to be rendered. The first part of the statute restricted the individual's right to his original cause of action (if any); and the second part stated that the purpose of the Act was merely to waive the State's immunity from suit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen obtained permission from the legislature, in the form of an act, to file a personal injury action against the state. The act provided that the procedure in the action would be the same as between private litigants, and that the act did not confer on the citizen any greater or different claim than he had previously. The state argued that the act violated La. Const. art. III, &sect; 35, which required a &quot;method of procedure and the effect of the judgments&quot; which could be rendered. The trial court maintained the state's exceptions, held the act unconstitutional, and dismissed the citizen's action. The citizen appealed. The court held that the act sufficiently set forth the procedure of the permitted action by designating the customary procedures employed in actions between private litigants. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the act properly described the effect of the judgments by limiting the citizen's authority to sue the state to the claim for which express permission was granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted rehearing in the case, in which plaintiff filed suit against defendants, asserting one-half ownership of the mineral rights of a property based on a prescription of 10 years liberandi causa. The rehearing was restricted to a consideration of the plea of 10 years prescription liberandi causa.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contended that his plea of prescription was not affected by an order of the Commissioner of Conservation that pooled and unitized all separately owned property interests in the area. The court found that plaintiff had no interest in the minerals because his reversionary interest in the minerals did not become a possessory interest until after the contested order was issued. For the sake of considering the issues on which the rehearing was granted, however, the court assumed that plaintiff's reversionary interest in the minerals vested him with some right to be notified of the hearing before the commissioner. On this basis, the court found that, contrary to a prior holding, the commissioner was not a necessary party because he had no interest in the action. The court found that the action only affected the rights of plaintiff and defendants. Second, the court found that, contrary to the holding of the trial court, plaintiff was not entitled to personal notice of hearings. The court found that all of the provisions prescribed for giving notice by publication were complied with, and the commissioner was only required to mail notice to the known interested parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On rehearing, the court ordered that the judgment of the trial court be reversed, avoided, and set aside.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, owners of a piece of property, brought an action against defendants, a mother and her daughter, who were the owners of one-half of the mineral rights to the property. The property owners claimed that defendants' rights had prescribed because of non-use for more than 10 years. The mother claimed that, despite the provisions of 1944 La. Acts 232, because the daughter was a minor, prescription was suspended as to the daughter during her minority and that the prescription also operated in her favor. 1944 La. Acts 232 provided that the prescription operated only in favor of the minor and also provided for a period of one year within which any person whose rights would be affected by the act to exercise his or her rights. The trial court recognized the daughter as the owner of one-fourth of the mineral rights but ruled that the mother's rights had prescribed. The court held that depriving the mother but not the daughter from the use of the servitude was not an impermissible division of the servitude. The court also held that 1944 La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife challenged the trial court's judgment that denied her reconventional demand for a divorce from her husband, denied her demand for alimony, and granted her husband a divorce. The wife asserted that the husband's action for divorce on the ground that the parties had lived apart for two years was premature. The court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court noted that the testimony of the husband and his sister that they did not know why the wife moved in with the sister was not impressive and lacked credibility. The wife asserted that the parties did not separate until she moved in with her parents, and the husband asserted that they were separated when the wife moved in with her sister-in-law. The court held that while the husband's version lacked credibility, the trial court committed no manifest error in its judgment in favor of the husband. The court held that the wife proved that she was not at fault for the separation and subsequent divorce pursuant to La. Civ.

Defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated the right to engage in private business under the Due Process clauses of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, imposed a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art.

The court affirmed, holding that the ordinance was a valid, reasonable exercise of the city's police power for the purpose of protecting residents from potentially lawless solicitors. The court held that the ordinance did not unduly burden interstate commerce, as it did not impose a tax or license and did not burden the distribution or manufacture of a commodity, and that there was no denial of freedom of the press because there was no censorship or interference with distribution.

The city accordingly annexed an area abutting the existing corporate limits. The citizen, who resided in the annexed area, challenged the constitutionality of the legislation and of the city's ordinance. The citizen alleged that the legislation violated the state constitution and the Constitution because it limited inquiry into its provisions and deprived his due process rights. The trial court maintained the city's exceptions of no cause and no right of action and dismissed the claim. The citizen appealed. The supreme court held that the action made no claim for monetary damages, and failed to place a value on the claimed violations and injustices presented. The supreme court held that the action was of the sort that did not lend itself to a determination of its monetary value, and because there was not evidence that the action exceeded the $ 2000 jurisdictional amount, the case should be transferred to the court of appeal pursuant to La.

The lower court held that the taxpayers did not have a right of action because Act 192 was unconstitutional in that it authorized suit to be brought in any of the district courts of the state, regardless of the location of the nuisance sought to be abated, thereby extending the territorial jurisdiction of the several district courts beyond their respective limits as fixed by the state constitution. It also held that such proceedings were in violation of the due process clause of the state and federal constitution. La. Const. 1921, art. 1, &sect; 2; U.S. Const. amend 14. On review, the court analyzed the history of the legislation at issue and determined that the legislature did not have the power to adopt an act which had the effect of extending the territorial jurisdiction of the several district courts so that the jurisdiction of each court would be co-extensive within the boundaries of the state. In affirming the judgment below, the court agreed that Section 3 of Act 192 of 1920, as amended by Act 120 of 1940, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, a taxpayer and voter, sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent parish council members to call an election on his proposed amendments to the plan of government of the city and parish. After a trial, the district court (Louisiana) sustained the council's exception of no cause of action and dismissed the taxpayer's suit. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city government's plan provided that amendments to the plan could be proposed upon submission of a petition containing the signatures of voters in the amount of 10 percent of the votes cast for sheriff at the last election. The petition as submitted to the council contained the names of 212 qualified electors of the parish. At the general election for sheriff, 1,000 votes had been cast; at the primary election for sheriff, more than 27,000 votes were cast. Affirming, the court held that the word &quot;election&quot; in the city plan referred to the primary election, not the general election. In that parish, there was only one political party. Nomination by the Democratic party was tantamount to election; therefore, very few voters voted in the general election. The court held that the plan drafters intended, by referring to the sheriff's election, to require a large number of signatures to the petition, because the sheriff's primary election typically brought out the most voters. Therefore, the drafters did not intend to refer to the general election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The carrier contended that the adoption of two ordinances by the city council had effectively denied him a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Because the carrier did not allege that the ordinances were illegal or unconstitutional, their legality and constitutionality were presumed. What the carrier was really requesting was for the court, by writ of mandamus, to order the city commission to legislate by adopting an ordinance where none existed, permitting it to conduct its business by securing a certificate of public convenience and necessity. A writ of mandamus could be issued only when there was a clear and specific legal right to be enforced or a duty which ought to and could have been performed but could not be sued to compel performance of an act that would not result in any benefit to the party seeking it. The ordinances in effect when the carrier applied required a franchise to exist before a bus line could be operated in the city. Therefore, even if the court granted the relief sought and compelled issuance a certificate of convenience and necessity, the carrier would nevertheless not be entitled to operate his bus line.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which denied his demands in a suit brought by authority of 1938 La. Acts 330 for a refund of money that the taxpayer paid under protest to appellee Louisiana Collector of Revenue, as an occupational tax for engaging in the business of operating gambling slot machines. At issue was the constitutionality of 1934 La. Acts 15, &sect; 20(d) as amended by 1948 La. Acts 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that, by the exaction of a tax on the business of operating slot machines, the taxing statute actually licensed and legalized the gambling operation in direct disobedience of the constitutional mandate of La. Const. art. 19, &sect; 8. The trial judge was of the opinion that, because 1934 La. Acts 15, &sect; 20(d) specifically provided that the payment of the tax imposed could not be held to legalize the operation of any machine or device defined in the statute that was prohibited by law, it was manifest that the constitutional mandate for the suppression of gambling by the Louisiana State Legislature was not violated. On appeal, the court agreed with the ruling. The argument that the use of the word &quot;license&quot; in the legislation connoted the grant of a right to engage in the business, subject to the license tax, overlooked the difference between licenses to engage in certain businesses that were subject to regulation under the police power, and a license or excise tax levied solely for revenue under the government's taxing power. Taxes were not favors; they were burdens laid as excises upon the doing of business, whether lawfully or unlawfully conducted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Town of Lake Providence appealed judgments of a district court (Louisiana), which, in consolidated cases, awarded damages to plaintiff property owners for the Town's negligent operation of its electric light and power plant, which caused fires on the owners' properties. Plaintiffs answered the appeal seeking interest from the date of judicial demand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town built the power plant pursuant to 1898 La. Acts 136, &sect; 13, as amended by 1916 La. Acts 135, and 1942 La. Acts 129. The fires resulted from a break in a circuit wire, which had been caused by a truck hitting the wire The wire had been hung below the minima prescribed by the Louisiana Department of Highways and recommended by a national safety organization. On appeal, because the town did not specify the constitutional provision under which 1898 La. Acts 136, &sect; 13, as amended, was attacked, the court did not consider the issue. The court held that the town's challenge to 1916 La. Acts 135 based on La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 15, which applied to ex post facto laws, had no merit. Nor did 1916 La. Acts 135 offend La. Const. of 1921, art. IV, &sect; 3, which applied to contract claims. The owners' claims were suits for damages. The propriety of 1916 La. Acts 135 was for the legislature to determine. The town's argument that the owners were contributorily negligent, raised first in a motion for new trial 14 months after judgment, was not newly discovered evidence. The court held that the trial court's finding of negligence was correct. The court awarded the owners the interest they sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge refused defense counsel's request for a directed verdict or an order to nolle prosequi the case. On appeal, the court pointed out that a directed verdict was not authorized under Louisiana law. It was within the jury's province alone to determine the weight and credibility of the evidence. Also, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 329, a decision to nolle prosequi the case was a matter solely within the sound discretion and control of the district attorney. Cross-examination of the prosecutrix respecting specific acts of sexual intercourse with another man was properly prohibited. Where consent was a defense, the general reputation of the prosecutrix for unchastity could be shown; however, particular acts of indiscretion by the prosecutrix with third parties were inadmissible. Finally, because La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 386 made it mandatory for the trial judge to instruct the jury that a verdict of attempt to commit simple rape would be responsive to the indictment for attempt to commit aggravated rape, defendant was charged with knowledge, at the time he was tried for attempt to commit aggravated rape, that he could be found guilty of the lesser offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mineral claimants appealed a judgment of the district court (Louisiana), which sustained plaintiff property owner's plea of prescription of 10 years against the rights of all of the mineral claimants except two minors and decreed the cancellation of an oil, gas, and mineral lease held by one of the mineral claimants, an oil company. The owner appealed from the judgment rejecting his demand against the two minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disputed mineral servitude was executed by a preceding owner, and the minors acquired their interests by inheritance. Also, the Commissioner of Conservation ordered a pooling and unitizing of all separate property interests within prescribed areas, which included the owner's property. On appeal, the court found that, in view of the provisions of his deed, the owner did not possess the minerals in good faith, actually, and sincerely believing himself to be the owner thereof or believing that he had a title then sufficient to transfer them. Therefore, the court concluded that the owner's plea of acquisitive prescription was without merit. The court found that the liberative prescription of 10 years for non-user commenced running against the mineral servitude after the owner acquired the land. The court found, however, that a suspension of the prescription occurred when the minors inherited their interests in the servitude. The court found, however, that further findings rested on the validity of the commissioner's order. Therefore, the court concluded that the commissioner was a necessary party to the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an interstate oil pipeline company, appealed from a judgment of the district court (Louisiana), which dismissed his action seeking to recover the amount of taxes that were paid under protest to defendant, a parish sheriff and tax collector, for the year 1944 on property that was assessed for that year against its prior owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax was paid under a proviso that was intended to exclude from the entire limits of a levee district all property within the area covered by a floodway with the exception of rights of way and other property owned by all railroads, pipe lines, and common carriers or other public utilities and situated and located within the excluded area. The pipeline contended that this constituted discrimination in that its properties were assessed for taxation under this proviso, while other properties in the same geographical area were specifically excluded from the taxing district. The court noted that the determining factor in the matter of classification was that of reasonableness as opposed to arbitrariness, whim or caprice. The court found that the legislature's reasoning, that certain classes of property would not suffer the same fate as other property and, therefore, all of that property was made to bear the burden of taxation constituted a reasonable and legitimate exercise of its taxing power. The court further found no intimation that the action of the assessor was of such nature as to make it result in a violation of any of the constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

The motion was overruled and defendant was placed on trial and found guilty. He appealed and the court annulled and set aside the conviction. The court found that the indictment charging defendant was sufficient in that it used the language of the statute and that the article of the Criminal Code covering the crime of manslaughter was constitutional in that it defined the crime clearly. However, the court found that defendant's motion to quash wherein he alleged that there were no grand jurors of his race in the regular panel was timely filed, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 202, within three days of the term for which the jury was drawn.

Simultaneously, it publicly declared that it had been advised of the illegality and unconstitutionality of the proposed amendments. Plaintiffs petitioned to enjoin the calling and holding of the election. The district court granted a permanent injunction, and the parish council and intervenors appealed. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed plaintiffs' action, holding that: (1) the general rule that an injunction would not be granted to prevent the holding of an election applied and the suit had to be dismissed as premature; and (2) an injunction would not lie to restrain a public body from performing its ministerial duty in submitting an initiative or referendum measure where the threatened injury was not irreparable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dredging company operated in coastal waterways, both in and out of Louisiana waters. It obtained power to run its equipment from onboard generators. It paid a license tax to the State, but refused to pay the power tax, which assessed a tax based upon the amount of power a business used through its own generation. The dredging company argued that the power tax was an unconstitutional dual tax, and that it invaded the admiralty and commerce jurisdictions of the United States. In annulling the dismissal and entering judgment for the State, the court held that (1) the requirement frequently made essential to the existence of double taxation in the unconstitutional sense, namely, that both impositions must be against the same taxable subject, was lacking in the instant case because the license tax was imposed for the privilege of engaging in the business of contractor in the State, whereas the power tax was levied for a different reason, and (2) the power tax did not invade the admiralty and commerce jurisdictions of the United States because the tax applied only while dredging in State waters, and not on that part of the power used in the navigation of vessels.</SPAN></P>

The petition also alleged that the council refused and failed either to pass the ordinance or to submit it to the electors of the city. The trial court sustained the exception of no cause or right of action on the ground that 1910 La. Acts 302, &sect; 16, established the budget system for administering the city's fiscal affairs and granted the power of making up and controlling the budget exclusively to a commission council, and that necessarily the right of initiative and referendum was not intended to encroach on the commission council's authority in respect to the budget. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment sustaining the exception of no cause or right of action because the submission of the ordinance to the electorate in its unaltered form would have been a submission of a dual proposition, which was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partnership, which operated a retail market, sold alcoholic beverages at prices below the minimum markup required of retailers and, as a result, was charged with violating the provisions of 1948 La. Acts 360. The partnership was ordered to appear before the board and show cause why its off-premise liquor license should not be suspended. The hearing before the board resulted in a 30-day suspension of the partnership's license. The partnership then sought injunctive relief with respect to enforcement of the order suspending its liquor license. The trial court found in favor of the partnership and issued an injunction prohibiting the board from enforcing the 30-day suspension and from interfering in any manner with the operation of the partnership's business. The board and its supporting intervenors appealed. The court affirmed and held that 1948 La. Acts 360, &sect;&sect; 1(s), 24, and 26, which provided for mandatory minimum markups, were manifestly unreasonable within the contemplation of the state's police power and, hence, violated the due process clauses of the Louisiana and U.S. Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city instituted its action against the board to have 1948 La. Act 234 declared unconstitutional because it changed the form of government in the city from commission to aldermanic and because the title of the act was misleading and deceptive. The trial court found in favor of the city and the board appealed. The court annulled and set aside the trial court's judgment and dismissed the city's suit. The court held that 1948 La. Act 234 was constitutional and that it had not substituted an aldermanic form of government for the commission form. The court stated that there had been no legislative powers of the municipality placed in one body of public officials. The act's title had indicated that it was being enacted for the purpose of amending other acts, and sufficiently notified legislators and the general public of the subject matter contained therein. This, the court stated, had met the constitutional requirements of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. The commission form of government was not codified as such for the city, but rather all municipal powers were to be delegated to a single board in much the same manner as a private corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer, which was the Department of Civil Service (Louisiana), argued for the first time on rehearing that even if the employee was reinstated to his position, he was not entitled to the loss occasioned by him through his unlawful discharge and was estopped from claiming lost pay. The employer also asserted that under the provisions of 1940 La. Acts 171, &sect; 34, the Civil Service Commission was vested with discretion to award or deny full pay for lost time when ordering the reinstatement. The employee contended that because he was not reinstated, the Commission's alleged discretion regarding lost pay was never invoked. The court held that it would not disturb its original holding because the original judgment as to back salary followed the court's jurisprudence in other case law and because the doctrine of estoppel had no foundation in law. The court found that the employee received a salary in excess of the salary paid to Civil Service employees and that all parties knew the facts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor challenged a judgment entered in favor of defendants, a city and the Commissioner of Public Utilities, in a district court (Louisiana) in his action to enjoin certain construction work that was being performed through the city's own crew. The contractor claimed that the work was done without letting a contract to the lowest responsible bidder as required under Act No. 73 of 1926, as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor engaged in the construction business relating to sewerage and water lines. The city's crew was performing certain construction work that extended the sewerage and water system. The contractor argued that under the provisions of Act No. 73 of 1926, as amended, when public work exceeded the sum of $ 1,000 it was the city's duty to let the work by contract. He sought to enjoin the construction work the city's crew was doing. The district court ruled for the city and Commissioner. The court affirmed, holding that nothing in the title of the Act prohibited the city from doing its own work, and nothing in the title provided that contracts had to be let to private contractors. The Act related to the letting of a contract when a contract was to be let. The title made no reference to work done by the city with its own force but only to work that was done under contract. A provision that all contracts for public improvements or building had to be let to the lowest responsible bidder did not prevent the city from constructing such work under the direction of its own engineers and officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of their convictions entered in the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) of gambling and of an order to have a slot machine destroyed. Defendants claimed that 1928 La. Acts 231 (Act), under which the machine was destroyed, was unconstitutional and that it was error to deny their motion for a new trial because the State failed to submit any evidence to sustain the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence revealed that a slot machine that contained pictured symbols and indicated certain winning combinations was kept on display and that after money was placed in it and a winning combination exhibited an award was given. Defendants claimed that was insufficient and that the Act was unconstitutional because it authorized the destruction of property without due process of law. The court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to authorize a conviction. If slot machines were property susceptible of ownership, the Act, which did not provide for notice or hearing but ordered the summary destruction of all gambling devices, was violative of the constitutional guarantee of due process. However, if they were things obnoxious to the public health or safety, or to the public morals, they were contraband and proper subjects for summary confiscation and destruction under the police power. The legislature, in the exercise of its police power, had the right to declare that gambling slot machines should be confiscated and their destruction without notice did not render the Act unconstitutional on a claim of due process as one could not acquire property rights in a condemned article.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute concerned the disbursement of an appropriation made by the legislature in the General Appropriation Act, 1948 La. Acts 350, &sect; 4, schedule 110, item 8, to carry into effect the minimum salary schedule for public school teachers of which 1948 La. Acts 155 directed the establishment and maintenance. The school board claimed that the legislature could not disregard the formula for distribution of the state public school fund as specified in La. Const. of 1921, art. XII, &sect; 14, as amended by Act No. 2 of the Extra Session of 1947. The court found that the constitutional provisions were not free of ambiguity and could reasonably be construed as requiring the legislature only to maintain in the state public school fund, to be apportioned and distributed therefrom under the prescribed formula, an annual sum of at least $ 10 million. The court determined that any excess in the fund could be similarly distributed for public school purposes in such manner as the legislature deemed advisable because that body's power over state funds was plenary. Reversing and dismissing, the court held that the assailed appropriation was legal, constitutional, and payable as intended.</SPAN></P>

The board was enjoined from recognizing the candidate as the superintendent and was commanded to consider the alleged elected superintendent as elected. The candidate was restrained from performing any duties of the office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether two alleged members of the board were legally serving under the confines of 1922 La. Acts 100, &sect; 17. That provision was made for the election, in each police jury ward in a parish, of a school board member for each police juror. The alleged elected superintended contended that &sect; 17 rendered inoperative the votes of the members of the board in question because the board did not have any jurisdiction over or control of, the high school and grade schools belonging to and maintained by the City of Monroe, Louisiana, and the board members in question were illegally serving as school board members. Defendants contested the alleged elected superintendent's definition of city as used in the legislation. The court found that the City did not come within the purview of &sect; 17. The board had jurisdiction to establish a junior college in the City. Therefore, it would have been unreasonable and unfair if the Louisiana Legislature by &sect; 17 denied the people of the City representation on the board where the board owned, maintained, and operated public schools within the limits of the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the judgment. The court ordered the injunction dissolved and the demands of the alleged elected superintended rejected and the suit dismissed at his costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff relator sought review of a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which dismissed its suit against defendants, city and others, to test the constitutionality of a plan of government for the city and a parish as well as the constitutionality of the amendment authorizing adoption of the plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relator alleged six different grounds of nullity of the constitutional amendment. The court found that the amendment had to be logically viewed as a plan of government which, while embracing several subjects, all were germane to the general purpose of the amendment, and that the constitutional requirements had been met in their submission by one amendment. The court determined that express and specific authority for the allocation of the parish's revenues and funds to the city were contained in La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 3(a)(2). The court noted that even if a certain provision of the amendment relating to land use was decreed invalid, the validity of the remainder of the provisions could be sustained due to the presence of a severability clause. Because the city was vested with the authority to construct, repair, and maintain streets, sidewalks, and public ways within its corporate limits, the court ruled that the amendment validly transferred such power to the parish. The court concluded that La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 3(a), authorized the extension of the city limits by the plan of government. Affirming, the court held that illegality did not appear beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The highway department issued the check in another jurisdiction and the check was deposited in yet another jurisdiction. The facts relied on by the state as constituting a substantial element of the crime were merely the preparation of a fraudulent scheme.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow purchased certain shares of the association's investment and savings stock during her marriage to her husband and up to the time of his death. The contestant filed an action in which she claimed that the shares were community property and not the separate property of the widow. A trial court entered judgment for the contestant, and the court affirmed that decision. On rehearing, the court set aside its prior decision. The court held that the status of the shares was controlled by the statutes in force at the time of the purchases of the stock. The investment shares were purchased under the provisions of 1902 La. Acts 120, which permitted married women to subscribe for and hold stock in savings and loan associations as their separate property without the consent or authorization of their husbands. Under 1938 La. Acts 337 and 1940 La. Acts 95, however, while a wife was permitted to subscribe for an hold stock, there was no provision that such shares were to be considered her separate property. The court, therefore, remanded the case in order to determine the dates when the shares were purchased and to determine the widow's indebtedness, in any, to the community.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's demurrer or motion to quash the bill of information was sustained. The trial judge decided that the word &quot;indecent&quot; was not definite or specific enough to describe any particular kind of &quot;print, picture, written composition, model or instrument.&quot; Thus, La. Crim. Code art. 106(2) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The word &quot;indecent&quot; had many different meanings. La. Crim. Code art. 106(2) did not sufficiently define the offense so specifically or accurately that any reader having ordinary intelligence would have known when or whether his conduct was on the one side or the other side of the border line between that which was and that which was not denounced as an offense against the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private clubs argued that 1940 La.

The private clubs claimed that, because &sect; 3 failed to state that the action had to be filed in a district court that had jurisdiction, it violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2 and art. 7. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause, concluding that the private clubs had no right to plead the unconstitutionality of the Act because it did not purport to give the plaintiff in an abatement suit such as the instant actions the right to select the district court in which he would institute his suit, and because the instant actions were brought in the district court in which the private clubs were domiciled and in which the alleged gambling houses were located. The court noted that the words &quot;shall have the right to file a suit in any district court&quot; as used in &sect; 3 meant &quot;shall have the right to file a suit in any district court having jurisdiction&quot;.</SPAN></P>

In overruling the motion to dismiss, the court found that the case was not moot because, while the permits would have already expired, the holder had a substantial interest in having the revocation declared invalid so that he could apply for another permit prior to the passage of five years. The revocation of a liquor permit was a forfeiture as the term was used in La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10. The applicant for such a permit had, if he was qualified in accordance with the requirements recited in Act 15 of 1934, as amended, a right to have the permit issued to him, which right he could enforce in the courts. The revocation of the permits constituted a forfeiture within the meaning of La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10, which conferred jurisdiction upon the court. La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10, simply required that the legality or constitutionality of a forfeiture should be in contest in order to give the court appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 21, &sect; 1. The court held that the constitutional amendment was really only one amendment, authorizing the city to establish and to maintain one or more railroad passenger stations and, as an incident thereto, to eliminate certain grade crossings of tracks entering the station or stations. The other attack on the validity of the amendment was that the voters were not properly notified or informed of the contents or provisions of the amendment as required by La. Const. art. 21, &sect; 1. The court found that there was no merit in the argument that the voters were misled or were not sufficiently informed of the contents or provisions of the proposed amendment. As to the complaints to the contract, a sufficient answer was that the provisions at issue were all specifically authorized by the constitutional amendment; therefore, it was beyond the power of the court to question their legality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant exposed himself in the presence of two 16-year-old girls.

On appeal, the court agreed with the state that the act itself, when considered with all the facts and circumstances surrounding it, showed an intention on the part of the defendant to arouse his sexual desires. Furthermore, the court found that La. Crim. Code art. 81 was intended to apply to behavior which fell short of sexual intercourse, carried on with young children, and to cover indecent sexual displays in the presence of children under the age of 17. There was a sufficient showing of intent to justify conviction.

The court affirmed his conviction. The court ruled that the bill of information was sufficient because it set forth the act allegedly committed by defendant and charged that it violated La. Crim. Code art. 81. The court also found that art. 81 properly described the prohibited acts, lewd and lascivious conduct with a person under age 17. Art. 81 was constitutional. The court was charged with examining the trial court's decisions on questions of fact as well as questions of law. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Defendant admitted at trial that he was over the age of 17, and defendant consented to testimony by a 6-year-old girl. The court found that it was true that the alleged victim's statement was not entirely consistent in all of the details, but that it was not a valid reason for concluding that she was unworthy of belief.</SPAN></P>

In setting aside defendants' convictions, the court found that it was obvious from the restriction of the privilege of selling wine for table use on Sunday to hotels and boarding houses and the denial of that privilege to restaurants, that the Act had no relation to the health, morals, or safety of the public or of the operators of restaurants. There could be no reason of public policy for preventing proprietors of restaurants from selling wine with meals on Sunday, while the operators of hotels and boarding houses were allowed to do that very act. To be constitutional a statute must not make or countenance any discrimination between persons pursuing the same calling. Act No. 18 of 1886 was discriminatory insofar as it applied to defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the Act was violative of La.

Defendants also claimed that the indictment was invalid because it did not allege the facts and circumstances upon which the offense was based. Furthermore, defendants urged that under the Act it was left to the discretion of the judges, district attorneys, and grand jurors to determine what constituted the crime. On appeal, the court held that the provisions in the Act with reference to the means of prospecting, which was the only addition to the body of the act, were germane to the object expressed in the title. In addition, the title only had to indicate the general purpose of the law. The court further determined that the indictment set forth all the elements and ingredients necessary to constitute the offense and fully apprised defendants of the nature and cause of the accusation. Finally, the court held that the Act firmly established what constituted the offense and that nothing was left to the discretion of the judiciary to determine.</SPAN></P>

The widow failed to prove that the property in question was her separate property. All effects that both husband and wife reciprocally possessed were presumed common effects or gains unless proven that the property was brought into the marriage or received or inherited separately.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, Louisiana Health and Human Resources Administration, complained of the judgment of the trial court (Louisiana), which granted plaintiff dairy's request for a writ of mandamus and ordered the administration officials to issue a permit to the dairy authorizing it to import milk from its plant in Mississippi, provided those products met the specifications of the Louisiana Sanitary Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the dairy's application was denied solely on the basis of the difference between Mississippi and Louisiana Grade A milk standards. At no time did the officials attempt to see if the dairy was in compliance and in fact refused an offer of proof of such compliance prior to trial. The officials contended that they are helpless to determine if the dairy is meeting the requirements. The court held that the officials could require the dairy to comply with the requirements, and audit compliance, but could not defeat the permissible importation of milk under the statute simply by refusing to implement its provisions to ensure compliance with Louisiana standards. Such a scheme would amount to an arbitrary application of the law and hence an unreasonable interference with interstate commerce. The court held that mandamus was proper because granting the permit was not discretionary, and that the laws applied equally to all milk producers because only milk meeting Louisiana's standards could be imported.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner had at one time leased his neighbor's property and built a road on it to allow him access to his own property. Subsequently, the lease was terminated and the neighbors denied the landowner passage across their property. The landowner filed suit to establish his right to use the road on the neighbors' property and obtained a temporary restraining order preventing the neighbors from denying him access. The trial court later recalled the preliminary injunction and ruled against the landowner on the merits of his claim. On appeal, the court agreed that the landowner was not entitled to a gratuitous servitude. However, the court found that the trial court erred in sustaining the neighbors' exception of no cause of action. The court held that the landowner's amended petition did state a cause of action under La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 699 and 700. The court further found that the landowner's property was enclosed and that the shortest passable route to a public road was across the neighbors' property and that therefore the landowner was entitled to a legal servitude of passage over the neighbors' property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to fix the servitude of passage at a place least injurious to the neighbors and to assess the amount of compensation owned by the landowner for the servitude.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was initially employed by a parish school system as an actuary.

No deductions were ever made for retirement benefits while he worked for the parish system. After the parish system merged with the state system, the employe filed for retirement benefits, claiming credit for the 22 years of service under the parish system. The employee was paid for several years until which the state system discontinued payments. The trial court rejected the employee's mandamus suit on grounds that mandamus was not the proper procedure and because the employee was never an employee of the parish system. On appeal, the court held that mandamus was available to the employee. The court held that upon the merger, 1971 La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner suffered damage to trees on his property when an electric power cooperative sprayed along its power lines from a helicopter. The district court awarded damages to the property owner, finding that the power cooperative had exceeded a 20-foot servitude that existed on the property. On review, the power cooperative contested the width of the servitude and the property owner for the first time argued that the statutory authority creating a servitude, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12:428, violated U.S. Const. art. V, U.S. Const. amend. 14, and La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 15 (1921), and La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2 and 4. The court affirmed the judgment, denying both appeals. The court reasoned that because the power lines had been in existence for a year prior to purchase of the property, the assumption was that a servitude existed and that 20 feet was a reasonable width. The court overruled the property owner's constitutional challenge to the statute because the property owner had failed to plead the unconstitutionality of the statute in the district court and the general rule was that a constitutional challenge to a statute could not be raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city suspended the licensee's permits because the licensee's female employees solicited drinks from patrons in violation of Bossier City, La., Code of Ordinances &sect; 5-7(7). On appeal, the licensee argued that the trial court erred in affirming the suspension of 1974 retail liquor permits in the calendar year of 1975 because, under the circumstances, the issue was moot. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the issue was not moot because under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:79 the correctness of the suspension would have a bearing on the licensee's application for subsequent permits. The court also rejected the licensee's contention that Bossier City, La., Code of Ordinances &sect; 5-7(7) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:88, which both prohibited solicitation by &quot;B-girls,&quot; violated equal protection rights of females. The court found that the city, in the exercise of its inherent police power, had the authority to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors. The licensee did not show that solicitation of drinks by males constituted a social evil of any significance and, thus, the court concluded that the classification along sex lines was not irrational or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered the sheriff to permit such examination. The sheriff contended that the law was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and overly broad, and that plaintiff failed to identify himself as an elector of the state, a taxpayer or any duly authorized agent of an elector or taxpayer. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:31 gives the right of examination of public records to any elector or taxpayer, and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:32 prohibits persons in custody or control of public records from making any inquiry of any person authorized by the law to examine a public record except for the purpose of establishing the person's authority. The definition of public records contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:1 was broad in the sense that it was virtually all inclusive. It was not, however, vague or indefinite.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civil service board questioned the court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal contending that the district court was sitting as an appellate court. The court held that the judicial review of an administrative decision was essentially a different process than the appellate review of a district court's judgment and that the court therefore had appellate jurisdiction. The court found that appellate jurisdiction was no longer based on the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the district court, that the court had jurisdiction over all civil matters decided within its circuit subject to exceptions specified in the constitution. La. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(A) (1974). The court held that the notice of appeal sufficed if it contained a reasonably clear and concise statement of the action from which the appeal was taken, and the notice of appeal was held sufficient. The court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the police officer's appeal without considering the merits.

The court held that the police officer was subject to the terms of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3534. The court then held that the police officer did not have a vested right to the vacation pay because there was no contract between the police officer and the police department. The court noted that the police officer was free to leave his employment at any time.

The five day period was required pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:396. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that the doctrine of contra non valentem was not applicable to the candidate's case because the law required the candidate to timely investigate the opposing candidate's residency. The court concluded that the candidate was required to conduct a timely investigation, which the candidate failed to do. The court held that the candidate lost his cause of action. Next, the court held that the five-day requirement was constitutional. The court stated that the mere fact that the constitution did not provide a mechanism to challenge candidacy requirements did not mean that such requirements could be challenged at any time.

The candidate argued that, although the opponent claimed to reside within the district at a home owned by his wife's daughter and son-in-law, the opponent and his wife had moved to a home outside the district many years before. On appeal, the court reviewed the opponent's testimony, that of his several witnesses, and other evidence. The court also reviewed the testimony and the evidence offered by the candidate. The court held that, taking the record in its entirety on the merits, it was clear that the trial judge acted correctly in dismissing the candidate's suit. The evidence fell far short of the proof necessary to disqualify the opponent on the ground he was not actually domiciled within the district. The court also held that, although the record did not contain a return showing the date and time of service of the candidate's petition on the opponent, even assuming that the answer was filed several hours later than the 48 hours permitted by &sect; 18:396, the late filing was immaterial in the case at bar.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To qualify for public office under La. Rev. Stat.

Under either method, nominating papers had to be received by 5:00 P.M. on the fifth day after the opening of qualifications for candidates. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:394 allowed candidates to qualify without fees, but the time and date for filing under &sect; 18:394 referenced statutory sections containing no provisions for time and date of filing. The politicians had attempted to qualify under &sect; 18:394 by mailing their papers to the secretary before the 5:00 p.m. deadline. The secretary received the papers after the deadline. The district court found the statutory references in &sect; 18:394 were inadvertent errors and that legislative intent for time and date of filing was found in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:391. The court agreed. Because the politicians were affiliated candidates, &sect; 18:391A governed the filing time and date. The politicians had to file in person with the secretary by the deadline. The untimely filings rendered the papers null and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants did not dispute their liability on an open account and a note. They claimed, however, that the service charges that were applicable to these liabilities, one and one-half percent per month up to the date of repeal of 1970 La. Acts 313, was illegal. In reversing the judgment, the court first held that Act 313 was not impliedly repealed by 1970 La. Acts 315 prior to its express repeal. The court next held that Act 313 was not limited in application to transactions involving credit cards. The court also held that Act 313, in using the terms &quot;extension of consumer credit,&quot; &quot;consumer purchaser,&quot; and &quot;open-end credit or similar account&quot; was not void for vagueness. But the court agreed that nothing in Act 313 permitted the charging of interest upon interest, which generally was prohibited by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1939. It followed that the amounts charged by plaintiff were in excess of that permitted under the Act 313. Finally the court held that one of the obligors had created a factual issue regarding the application of the excess of his dation en paiement to the joint obligation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the parties were married, the husband was injured. After the wife filed a petition for separation, he filed suit for his personal injuries under the Jones Act and general maritime law. The court granted a legal separation and the wife then filed a suit for a partition of the community property. The husband stipulated that the wife was entitled to one-half of that portion of an award attributable to the period from the date of his injury to the date the wife filed a petition for separation. The trial court awarded judgment in favor of the wife for one-half of all monies collected in the pending suit. The court affirmed. Because the injury occurred while the husband was married to and living in community with his wife, under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2334 she was entitled to one-half of all funds received by him either by way of a judgment for damages or by settlement. The court recognized the discrepancy between art. 2334 and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2402, under which damages resulting from personal injuries to the wife would not form part of the community, but held that this was not the proper forum to determine if the statutes were unconstitutional due to sexual discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The would-be candidate's notice of his intention of becoming a candidate was received by the chairman of the district's party executive committee after the deadline in La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was first admitted into the hospital pursuant to a coroner's custody order. Two months later, plaintiff brought her petition, pursuant to &sect; 28:53, for judicial commitment of the patient. Noting that the procedures under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:52 pertaining to confinement under coroner's treatment orders had not been followed, the trial court found that the procedures for judicial commitment, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:53, had been properly followed. In affirming, the court first found that, contrary to the patient's assertions, the procedures provided in &sect; 28:53 did not violate any of the constitutional safeguards provided for in the Fourteenth Amendment. Next, noting that the statutory procedures providing for a coroner's treatment order and for judicial commitments were separate and distinct, the court concluded that the judicial commitment of the patient was validly accomplished, even though the procedures for a coroner's order were not followed. Because the patient was legally committed under &sect; 28:53 at the time her habeas corpus hearing was held, the court reasoned that the issue of whether she had been unlawfully detained under the coroner's order was moot.</SPAN></P>

The ex-wife had previously successfully appealed from a judgment that denied her alimony based upon fault and obtained a judgment of $ 4,135 for executory alimony. The ex-husband argued that the alimony statute,&nbsp;La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160, was unconstitutional, and that the fact that the ex-wife had obtained gainful employment precluded her from an award of alimony. The trial court awarded the ex-wife executory alimony totaling $ 3,550. On appeal, the court amended and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the alimony statute was consistent with both the U.S. and Louisiana constitutions. The court noted that it permitted an award of alimony to needy husbands where appropriate. The court further amended the alimony award in favor of the ex-wife to $ 4,135. The court held that its prior judgment was final and immune to any amendment by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The school board sustained the charges and ordered the teacher's dismissal. The teacher initiated an action against the school board, claiming that La. Rev. Stat.

The teacher also claimed that the school board carried out acts of racial discrimination against black teachers and black students as a matter of policy. The trial court disposed of the contention of unconstitutionality. On appeal the court held that the offensive clause at issue was severable from the remaining parts of the act, such that the act itself was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' sons were killed in a civil riot that took place at a college university.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:1443 and 33:1444, the particular bond was a surety bond for defendant sheriff as the ex-officio tax collector. The trial court granted defendant surety's motion. On appeal, the court affirmed, reasoning the bond was a statutory bond, and, therefore, had to be interpreted in accordance with state law. The appellate court determined the bond in question was applicable only to the actions of defendant sheriff in his capacity as ex-officio tax collector.

The notary filed exceptions to the rule. The trial court dismissed his exceptions. The court affirmed finding that because the custodian's rule was clear that the notary was being ordered to show cause why he should not pay the fee before the deadline, and because the custodian was not attempting to make a premature collection of the fee, the exception of prematurity was properly overruled. The court found the notary's equal protection rights were not violated even though only notaries in the Parish of Orleans had to pay a fee and post a bond. The court held that a statutory discrimination would not be set aside because a state of facts which might reasonably could be conceived to justify it.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 23:898 had not been pre-empted by the federal Labor Management Relations Act because La. Rev. Stat.

Furthermore, the court held that the department had broad statutory powers that justified its investigation into whether the corporation violated &sect; 23:898, even where a violation of the statute would result in criminal penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad admitted violation, but argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Pointing to another ordinance imposing a 20 mile per hour speed limit, and by the inability of trains to exceed 10 miles per hour still stop at a local yard, the railroad argued that the ordinance effectively limited the length of its trains. On appeal, the court affirmed the injunction. The court found that the obstruction of crossings was a matter of local concern, thus reasonable local regulation was not precluded by the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court held that the city had a legitimate interest in preventing its citizens from being cut off from emergency services, which outweighed the burden claimed by the railroad. The court noted that the railroad's longest train could comply with the speed limit and pass within five minutes, and its self-imposed speed limit was not attributable to city. Finding a definite connection between the purpose of the ordinance to its provisions, and that it was calculated to accomplish that purpose, the court found it to be a valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the decision, the court held that neither as written nor as applied did La. Rev. Stat.

The police report presumably revealed the basic fact that the accident occurred in an intersection controlled by a stop sign which faced the driver, and that the other car was on the favored street. The reported physical circumstance as well as the hearsay of how the accident happened established the reasonable possibility of the driver's liability in the absence of contradictory evidence. At the departmental hearing the driver did not dispute but confirmed that she faced the stop sign. Because the purpose of the initial hearing was only to determine reasonable possibility of liability, commensurate procedural due process was afforded even at the initial hearing. However, the amount of the security was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was seen weaving in traffic. He was arrested and asked to submit to a toxometer test. He was told his driving privileges could be suspended if he refused. Despite asking, he was not allowed to consult an attorney. He refused to take the test. He requested a hearing with the Department of Public Safety. At the hearing, counsel filed a motion to quash raising several issues. The hearing examiner said he would refer the entire motion to the Department's counsel and asked the driver to sign a printed statement. Counsel refused to allow the driver to sign the statement. No further action was taken regarding the hearing and three days later the driver was notified of the Department's decision affirming the suspension order. The driver filed for injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the order. The court denied the request and rendered judgment for the Department. The trial court annulled and set aside the judgment and remanded for the issuance of a preliminary injunction against the Department. The court found the driver had not been afforded a proper opportunity for a hearing in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:668 and other provisions of the implied consent law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a business owner, sought review of a decision of the Twenty seventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Landry, (Louisiana), which declared that the business owner's nightclub was a public nuisance due to the existence of prostitution on the premises, enjoined the practice of prostitution on the business owner's premises, and closed the nightclub for one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a district attorney, brought an action to abate and enjoin the public nuisance of prostitution allegedly conducted on the premises owned by the business owner. The business owner owned a nightclub in which two undercover officers testified they were solicited by a female to engage in acts of sexual intercourse with her for an agreed price. It was alleged that the nightclub had a reputation of being place where prostitution was solicited. After the trial, the lower court issued an order that declared the nightclub a public nuisance due to the existence of prostitution on the premises, enjoined the practice of prostitution on the premises, and closed the nightclub for one year. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that there was no direct evidence that a physical act of sexual intercourse took place at the nightclub. However, the court determined that testimony--that a female offered herself for intercourse for hire with three different state police officers on two separate occasions--was clear evidence that prostitution was conducted at the nightclub.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was found buried underneath a dormitory unit after he was discovered missing and bloody weapons were found in the prison. The mother filed an action against defendants, alleging that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was applicable, that defendants were unconditionally liable under state statutes and under bailment theories, and that without absolute liability, her son's constitutional rights were violated. The trial court dismissed the action and the court affirmed. The court held that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was inapplicable because the evidence shows that there was sufficient security at the time of the murder and that the son could have voluntarily gone to the unit where he was found. The court found that defendants' release of one of the son's alleged assailants did not constitute negligence. The court held that the appropriate determination of liability was whether prison officials adhered to a reasonable standard of care and that this standard for negligence did not deny her son equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or constitute cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

The parties appealed attacking the assigned status of the stock and real property. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was correct in his assessment of the tract of land. The court held that the different obligation placed upon the husband in proving that property was intended to be separate did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. However, the court held that neither the husband nor the wife was the legal owner of the stock because the stock was not transferred in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Transfer Act or La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a flood, wild deer began to eat the landowner's crop. The landowner contacted the department, who was told by a representative that the landowner would be prosecuted if he killed the deer. The landowner brought this action alleging that as owners of all wild birds and wild quadrupeds, including wild deer, they were liable to him under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 for the damages he sustained to his crop. The trial court sustained the department and its commissioner's exception of no cause of action and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that the wild birds and wild quadrupeds found in the state were owned by the state in its sovereign capacity. The state owned them solely as trustee for the use and common benefit of the people of the state. The court held that the department employee had no authority to allow the landowner to shoot the deer and his statement to the landowner did not constitute a proximate cause of the loss. The department was not negligent in failing to control the wife deer and in preventing the animals from damaging the landowner's crop.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a reconventional demand seeking damages for the wrongful seizure of the automobile. The district court held for appellee. Appellant sought review. The court noted that when appellee filed the executory process suit, the order permitting executory process to issue was signed by a clerk of the parish court which was allowable under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 283 given the parish court was outside of Orleans Parish. The court, however, held art. 283 unconstitutional in its power to allow a clerk of court to issue orders of executory process. The court noted the lack of judicial control, authorization, or supervision that had been allowed prior to a sale as inconsistent with state laws on sequestration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant began hauling timber he purchased over an unimproved road, which crossed the property owners' land.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 33:52, which was the enabling statute. The court was concerned with the fact that &sect; 33:52 delegated the actual power to incorporate the village to 25 percent of the voters within the geographical confines of the proposed village. The court considered the question of whether this substantially less than majority percentage constituted an unreasonable delegation of authority. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that &sect; 33:52 was not patently unconstitutional when it was applied. The court found that &sect; 33:52 would have been unconstitutional except for the saving proviso to the effect that any interested citizen had the right to contest the proposed incorporation on two grounds: full compliance with the statutory provisions and reasonableness. The court concluded that &sect; 33:52 was saved from unconstitutionality by the statutory provision that enabled the district court to make the reasonableness inquiry. Further, the court found no manifest errors in the district court's conclusion that the incorporation was reasonable and in the district court's method of computing the assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that the superintendent of schools wrote a letter to the school board recommending that a probationary third-grade teacher be dismissed from her teaching duties for specified reasons relating to punishment and harassment of the children, absence from the classroom, disrespect of the children, unreasonable amount of homework, and child anxiety. Following authorization of the school board, the teacher was dismissed. The trial court upheld the dismissal following the teacher's suit seeing reinstatement. The teacher had argued that her dismissal was invalid under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:442 because she was not given &quot;pretermination&quot; notice nor an opportunity to rebut the charges against her. In affirming, the court ruled that there was no requirement in the statute for notice to a probationary teacher of the reasons for recommending dismissal and no requirement for a hearing to rebut the charges. Moreover, the teacher's charges that the absence of notice and a hearing violated the federal Due Process Clause was without merit, as the unconstitutionality of a statute must be specially pleaded in the trial court, and the teacher filed no such pleadings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opposing candidate alleged that a voting machine malfunctioned and that absentee ballots were not properly included. The court held that the temporary restraining order prohibiting election officials from counting the votes from that machine interfered with their mandatory duty to promulgate the election results in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1193. That mandatory duty could not be interfered with by judicial intervention until after the vote had been transcribed. However, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1193 and 18:1251 were not applicable to cases involving a general election to select a member to the United States Congress. Because the court was asked to conduct a judicial inquiry, the proper forum was the United States House of Representatives under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. Thus the trial court did not have jurisdiction to inquire into the election returns for the general election of a member of the House. Under its supervisory authority granted by La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2, the court directed the trial court to secure the integrity of the voting machine so that the candidates had a full opportunity to contest the election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the writ of certiorari be made peremptory, rendered judgment recalling, vacating, and setting aside the temporary restraining order except that portion relating to the preservation of the voting machine, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The automobile driven by the wife was struck when defendants' automobile ran a red light. The wife was killed and the husband sustained severe injuries. On appeal, the husband argued that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of evidence as to the invalidity of his marriage. The court, however, determined that the evidence was not beyond the scope of the pleadings and that it was properly admitted. The court also found that defendants carried their burden of proving the invalidity of the marriage because they introduced evidence showing that the wife's first marriage remained undissolved. The court found no compelling rational basis for discriminating between legal and putative spouses with respect to wrongful death actions under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315. Nevertheless, the court recognized its obligation, as did the trial court, to follow the unequivocal jurisprudence of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected defendants' contention that the amount awarded for the husband's injuries was excessive.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the costs of raw materials, labor and shop overhead expenses, transportation expenses, and all other related expenses were all includable elements of added value which when aggregated comprised the taxable base for the use tax under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff pleaded guilty to two separate violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98. The Department appealed the trial court judgment ordering plaintiff's driving privileges suspended for one year, but allowing him to drive to and from work. Specifically, the Department questioned the authority of the trial court under these conditions to suspend, rather than revoke, the license and to allow limited driving privileges. The court agreed, and held that the trial court had no discretion to suspend rather than revoke the license, or to grant limited driving privileges prior to issuance of a new license, given the express legislative mandate of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:414(B) requiring revocation after a second offense. The Department also contended that the trial court erred in making the penalty effective on the date of the Department's mailing of the notice of revocation. The court agreed, holding that, when a hearing has been applied for and a judgment of revocation rendered after the hearing, the revocation became effective when the licensee surrendered his license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department filed suit under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:461 et seq.

The company filed, inter alia, a dilatory exception of prematurity contending that the signs were erected prior to the effective date of &sect; 48:461 and thus were legally erected and the department could not therefore require their removal without paying for them. The exception was sustained by the district court and the action dismissed. The department appealed. On review the court reversed and set aside the dismissal. The court found that under the other provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:461.4, entitled &quot;Recognition Of Customary Uses,&quot; the legislature set out in detail the regulations as to lighting, size of signs, spacing of signs and as to certain types of signs which would not be permitted. The particularity as to where signs were prohibited, where they were permitted, and the types of signs permitted indicated that the legislature intended the act to become effective in 1966.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was a fireman for the employer for a period of approximately 12 years, during which time he drove a fire truck. After working all night driving the truck, the decedent went home and died later that day while sleeping, apparently from a heart attack. The employer paid workmen's compensation death benefits to the widow and the decedent's minor children. The employer then initiated an action to terminate the benefits and recover the amounts paid on the basis that the decedent's death was neither caused by an accident in the course of and arising out of his employment, nor was it the result of an occupational disease listed in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1031.1. The trial court entered a judgment for the widow, and the employer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the widow had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the heart attack and death of her husband was the direct result of the nature of the work he performed and that the exertion, stress, and strain occasioned by the decedent's duties on the night prior to his death caused, precipitated, or accelerated the subsequent fatal heart attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a concursus proceeding over the right to a decedent's funds in plaintiff Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana, defendant daughter appealed a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouse (Louisiana) awarding the funds to defendant second wife. The daughter argued that the Teachers' Retirement Act was unconstitutional in that it violated La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 4 by giving effect to an informal or invalid will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent named the second wife as his beneficiary using the procedure authorized by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 17:573, as amended 1952 La. Acts 418, &sect; 1, and 17:640, as amended 1971 La. Acts 5, &sect; 5. On appeal, the court noted that another circuit of the Court of Appeal of Louisiana rejected a constitutional argument similar to the daughter's with respect to a similar retirement system. In that case, the argument was that such a designation was either a donation mortis causa or a donation inter vivos and was void as lacking proper form under La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 1570, 1571, 1574, 1536. Following that decision, the court held that the Teachers' Retirement System had features closely analogous to an insurance contract and that the law relative to life insurance applicable to the naming of life insurance beneficiaries applied to the decedent's designation. The court also rejected the daughter's fallback argument that the decedent's estate was required to reimburse his first wife's estate for one-half the value of his contributions to the retirement system during his marriage to his first wife. Any such debt would be extinguished by confusion under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2217.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the decedent's funds in the retirement system be awarded to the second wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a town and a school board, challenged the judgment of the Second Judicial District Court of Louisiana in and for the Parish of Claiborne, which held them liable in a suit brought by plaintiff, a mother suing individually and as the natural tutrix of her minor child, to recover injuries sustained by the child as a result of an accident at a playground.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town and school board appealed from a judgment of the trial court awarding plaintiff $ 250,000 for the use and benefit of her minor daughter who sustained an injury at a playground constructed by the town on property belonging to the school board. As preliminary matter, the court held that plaintiff's suit was not barred by res judicata, prescription nor the unconstitutionality of the resolutions granting legislative permission for the action. The court then proceeded to find that there was negligence on the part of the town in the installation and maintenance of the playground equipment, which was the legal cause of the child's injury. The swing set that collapsed on the child was not properly anchored into the ground. The court also found that plaintiff was not contributorily negligent. However, the court found that the school board was not independently negligent and was not engaged in a joint venture with the town. The court affirmed the judgment against the town, but reversed the judgment against the school board. The damages awarded to plaintiff were reduced to $ 150,000, after the court found that the initial award was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board filed an action against the employee. The employee filed a reconventional tort demand. The trial court dismissed the reconventional demand based on sovereign immunity under La. Const. art. 19, &sect; 26 (1921). The court held that the judicially-established doctrine of sovereign immunity had been abrogated and that art. 19, &sect; 26 presupposed immunity from suit and proceeded to revoke previously-granted legislative waiver. However the court ruled that the 1960 amendment of art. 3 &sect; 35 authorized general waivers and that 1960 La. Acts. 25, &sect; 1 amended La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:51 and effectively waived every parish school board's immunity from suit. The court found that by 1962 La.

Acts 67 was unconstitutional insofar as it attempted to overrule La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35 and to provide 1960 La.

The court held that although the Department did not give proper notice to the driver of his right to a hearing, such deficiency did not adversely affect him because he subsequently had the benefit of administrative and judicial review. Because the governing statutes,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff son applied to the coroner for a confinement for treatment order for his mother under La. Rev. Stat.

Nearly two months later, the son filed a petition for the mother's judicial commitment under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:53. The mother, through her appointed attorney, filed an answer and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court committed the mother to the hospital pursuant to &sect; 28:53. The mother claimed that both statutes were unconstitutional, denied her due process and equal protection rights, and that the commitment order was invalid because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:52 was not complied with. The court rejected that argument. Proceedings under the two statutes were separate actions and an error in one did not invalidate the other. The court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:53 was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided for commitment of mentally ill persons who were found to be a danger to themselves or society. Two doctors' properly admitted certificates confirmed the mother's mental illness as required under &sect; 28:53.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collector of revenue sought to transfer the taxpayer's appeal to the state supreme court. The court denied the motion and held that the primary issue on appeal did not involve the constitutionality of the tax statute, but rather involved the application of the tax statute to the corporate taxpayer's operation. The court concluded that the taxpayer attacked the constitutionality of the tax statute only in the alternative. The court held that only if the court found that the imposition of the tax was correct under the statute, would the secondary or alternative issue of the constitutionality of the statute be reached. The court held that appellate jurisdiction must be determined by the principal demand or issue, not the alternative ground. The primary demand urged by the taxpayer for recovery of the tax was the method utilized by the collector in computing the tax that the taxpayer contended was violative of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation instituted the action against defendants, and its primary demand was for a writ of mandamus ordering defendants to certify that the corporation's property had maintained a &quot;non-conforming&quot; status under the ordinance, and that its property may be used for business or commercial purposes. Alternatively, the corporations prayed that the trial court issue a writ of certiorari to review a decision of defendants, which determined that the corporation's property had not maintained a non-conforming status under the ordinance. It further prayed that the matter be tried de novo in the trial court. The trial court rejected the corporation's demands, and the corporation challenged the decision. The court agreed with the trial court. The court believed that the procedures in the trial court satisfied all of the constitutional rights which the corporation had. The evidence showed that the corporation was not entitled to the occupational licenses which it sought and that in any event defendants had no authority to issue the type of license requested.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly concluded that the employee could not use the writ of mandamus to compel a discretionary act. The court concluded that the employee could not attack the constitutionality of Rule VIII, Paragraph 1.7(c), Civil Service Regulations of the City of New Orleans on appeal because the employee had not pleaded the issue before the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A group of out of state water transport companies filed suit against the Louisiana Tax Commission, challenging tax assessments and seeking to have the assessments declared unconstitutional and cancelled. The transport companies contended that because they maintained no office, agent, representative, or employee within Louisiana, no minimum contacts existed, thus the assessments on their personal property used in interstate commerce violated the Due Process Clause. The trial court sustained the commission's peremptory exception of no cause of action, upholding the validity of the assessments. On appeal the court held that the United States Supreme Court has consistently confirmed the rightful power of a state to levy and collect taxes on personal property, whether used in interstate commerce or otherwise, found within its territorial limits. The tax in question was fairly apportioned.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:1751 et seq. The district court granted the injunctive relief after concluding that the board of health was legally without authority to adopt the resolution. The board of health appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that while La. Rev. Stat.

The legislature intended to vest all of the functions and authority of the state, parish, and municipal boards of health in the commissioner of that state administration; as such, the city health department lacked authority to establish the minimum guidelines on its own initiative.</SPAN></P>

The teacher argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:443 was unconstitutional and that his dismissal was in violation of his right to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

The teacher argued that a portion of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:443 prohibiting advocacy of racial integration in schools was unconstitutional. The court did not reach the argument because the teacher did not preserve the issue for review by specifically pleading the affirmative defense of statutory unconstitutionality and there was no evidence to show that he was dismissed for advocating racial integration. The evidence showed that the teacher (1) left his classroom unattended on more than one occasion, (2) commented to students about sex between blacks and whites, (3) disturbed a teacher while walking down school halls, (4) did not give lesson plans or roll books to substitutes, and (5) refused to accept constructive criticism from superiors. While some of the teacher's conduct was regulated, other conduct needed no regulation to define their indecorum. The statements he made in class were not protected by the First Amendment. The board had a rational basis for dismissing the teacher in light of the evidence and the court refused to substitute the board's judgment with its own.</SPAN></P>

The only relief that defendant sought was release from the state hospital, and that relief could not be granted as she was currently detained under a valid judicial commitment order.

The district court ordered defendant to be judicially committed to the state hospital and denied as moot defendant's habeas request. The court affirmed. The state had conceded that the procedural requirements of &sect; 28:52 were not satisfied. However, there had been no deficiency in the judicial commitment pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

On review from dismissal of the paternity action for failure to state a cause of action and prescription under the six month statute of limitations, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 191 (1968), the husband argued that &sect;&sect; 9:396-9:398 created a new cause of action not subject to the Civil Code. The court found no merit in the argument and affirmed the dismissal. The court held that the husband was barred from contesting paternity six month s after the child's birth under art. 190 because he was present when the child was born and had signed the birth certificate. Similarly the court reasoned that even if a cause of action existed, it would be barred under art. 191. The court determined that the husband's claim of fraud was untenable because it was outweighed by the policy of protecting children against belated attacks upon their paternity.</SPAN></P>

The owners claimed that they were entitled to damages for the termination of monthly disability payments and to relocation assistance under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4201. The trial court rejected the owner's claims, and on appeal, the court reversed the judgment in part, holding that the owners could recover damages flowing from the termination of disability payments, as the right to the monthly payments became vested upon the owner's becoming disabled, and the future disability benefits were not speculative. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the claim for relocation assistance, holding that in this case the federal funds were loaned six years before the passage of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4201 and that the statute could not impose a new condition on a loan granted before its passage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board filed a petition with the trial court seeking to vacate a private corporation's mineral rights to the bottom of the state waterways. The trial court dismissed the petition, and the Board appealed the ruling. The court held that there was no impediment to a private owner obtaining mineral rights to the bottom of the state's waterways, if the water was non-navigable and could not be used for oyster production. The court determined that in this case, the evidence showed that the waterways to which the corporation obtained mineral rights were not navigable at the time the rights were given. The court also determined that because the waters were far away from the Gulf of Mexico, the state's protection of oyster production was not implicated. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, concluded that the corporation properly obtained mineral rights to the bottom of the state's waterways.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A period of 19 days elapsed from the time the judgment appealed from was signed until the motion for appeal was made. Appellant argued that under a prior decision of the court, where the clerk of a trial court sent out notices of judgment by custom, a party would not be deprived of his right to appeal where he relied on the practice of the trial court to notify him. The court stated that the motion for appeal came too late because La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 5002 only allowed 10 days after the expiration of the delays for applying for a new trial within which to file an appeal. The Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure, as amended, provided for the necessary rules that Louisiana courts had to follow, as directed by the legislature. The legislature had not provided that a notice of judgment was required. Appellant's argument that he received the notice late could not prevail because no notice was required. The custom of the trial court's clerk could not prevail over the requirements of the Code to allow an out-of-time appeal. The court overruled the precedent relied upon by appellant to the extent that it was inconsistent with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor executed a note secured by a mortgage on real estate and drawn to the order of &quot;future holder.&quot; The debtor paid the original note, but later pledged it to the creditors as collateral for a hand note. The debtor's failure to pay the indebtedness precipitated a foreclosure proceeding. The debtor sought to enjoin the seizure and sale. The trial court held that La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2638 and 2639 were constitutional, that the debtor failed to prove the debt had been extinguished, and that the note and mortgage were properly enforceable by the use of executory process. The court was bound by precedent holding the executory process statutes constitutional. The court held that the note was a collateral mortgage note and as such was not extinguished even though the obligation for which it was originally given was paid, and that it was validly reissued by the debtor and pledged to the creditors. Because the mortgage note was payable to &quot;future holder&quot; and endorsed in blank by the debtor, it was payable to the bearer and transferable by mere delivery. Accordingly, the creditors as pledgees-holders were correctly allowed to pursue collection by executory process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Louisiana Milk Commission appealed from a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana) in the Commission's action to enjoin defendant supermarket from offering or giving refunds to customers contrary to the Orderly Milk Marketing Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:940.1 et seq., which enjoined such offers or refunds unless conditioned on an adjudication of retroactive unconstitutionality of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the supermarket's state court suit attacking the constitutionality of the state's Orderly Milk Marketing Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:940.1 et seq., resulted in a decision upholding the statute and a permanent injunction enjoining the supermarket from violating certain provisions of the statute, the supermarket filed a suit in the federal court attacking the constitutionality of the statute. The supermarket then began offering customers refunds on milk purchases that would be payable if and when the statute was declared unconstitutional or was repealed, upon submission of caps and side panels from packages purchased by the customers. The Commission instituted an action to enjoin the refund offers and any refunds pursuant thereto, and the trial court granted an injunction that permitted offers and refunds conditioned upon an adjudication of retroactive unconstitutionality of the statute. On the Commission's appeal, the court held that the action was not for a declaratory judgment, and the trial court should not have permitted refund offers different from those sought to be enjoined, and which were not being made when the action was instituted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed insofar as it enjoined the supermarket from offering or giving refunds to customers contrary to the Orderly Milk Marketing Law, but was reversed insofar as it permitted the supermarket to make refund offers conditioned on an adjudication of retroactive unconstitutionality of the law, and broadened the judgment to enjoin refunds on the basis of caps and side panels issued pursuant to the offers giving rise to the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff towns sought review of an order from the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of West Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which entered a judgment for defendant police based on an exception of no cause of action. The exception alleged that there was no constitutional authority for the reallocation of the sales tax revenues as sought by the towns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The towns filed a petition seeking a declaratory judgment against the police that mandated said body to reallocate 41.6329 percent of the sales taxes derived as a result of an ordinance. The town contended that the trial court erred in sustaining the two exceptions of no cause of action. In its appellate brief the town based its entire argument, which it presented for the first time on appeal, on the premise that exceptions of no cause of action did not lie in declaratory judgment actions. The court found that there was no reason in logic or in law why an exception of no cause of action should be an inappropriate procedural device to use in response to a petition for a declaratory judgment, as provided by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1871. The court agreed with the trial court, which said that, accepting all of the facts of the town's petition as true, as a matter of law, it could not render the specific judgment prayed for by the towns and saw no reason for the delay or the expense of a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the record established both the existence of cattle and the existence of a particular herd belonging to the cattle owner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller sold his brother a one-half undivided interest in all of the land herein involved and thereafter the parties partitioned the property between themselves according to a survey.

Originally, the court remanded the action back to the trial court to determine whether La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 833, as amended was constitutional. The trial court determined that the statute was unconstitutional and awarded the brother the full acreage he requested. The current owner appealed. The court concurred with the trial court. The court held that the statute as amended was unconstitutional with respect to its affect on the brother's right to bring a boundary dispute action.

The court held that the state board had arrived at a factional quantity of &quot;Negro&quot; blood attributable to the wife of 5/32nd and of the two children at 2.5/32nd by ascribing arbitrary fractional quantities of &quot;Negro&quot; blood to race appellations that had no legally fixed racial definitions. In the absence of definitions accurately applied at the time race designations were made on the records, no accurate exact mathematical percentage could be computed to comply with the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:267. Therefore, the court rejected the state board's arguments that its evidentiary records warranted the original action in changing the birth certificates of the wife and children. In the absence of authoritative standards or definitions, the state board was without authority to make the original race designation change.

The note was paraphed for identification with an act of mortgage on immovable property executed by the investment corporation as mortgagor, and accepted by a finance corporation as mortgagee. After the property was sold the bank sued the indorsers to obtain a deficiency judgment. The court affirmed the deficiency judgment for the bank. The mortgage was properly executed by the mortgagor and mortgagee in the presence of the notary public and the two subscribing witnesses. Although the person that signed the note for the investment corporation was not authorized to do so at the time, the investment corporation's subsequent corporate resolution ratified the execution of the note and the mortgage of the person that signed both instruments. There was no error in the trial court's determination that the finance company negotiated the note to the bank. The finance company obtained the money for the investment company but there was no failure of consideration between those parties or as between the finance company and the bank.</SPAN></P>

The motion as to the costs was overruled by agreement of counsel and the motion for attorneys' fees was sustained. When plaintiff did not furnish the required bond, the trial court granted the police officer's motion to dismiss the case against him. Plaintiff appealed. A three-judge panel of the court reversed the trial court's decision. The police officer sought a rehearing en banc. The majority opinion represented only two judges; two others dissented and one concurred. The court affirmed its original judgment reversing the trial court's dismissal of the action. The court held that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:261(D), a plaintiff who had been allowed to proceed in forma pauperis was not required to furnish security for attorneys' fees.

Civ. Code art. 2324.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy sheriff was shot when he went to investigate a call that someone had broken into a local school. The deputy dragged the minor son out of the building and then went inside the building to see if anyone else was present where another minor twice shot him. The court affirmed liability under La. Civ. Code art. 2324. Although the minor son did not fire the shot that wounded plaintiff, he assisted or encouraged the shooting. The two minors were involved in a conspiracy to burglarize the school. Both were armed and both resisted arrest when officers tried to apprehend them. By entering into the conspiracy, the minor son actively assisted and encouraged the commission of any acts which were incidental to the commission of the offense. The minor son did not withdraw from the conspiracy by being in police custody at the time of the shooting because he could have communicated his withdrawal to the other minor before the shooting. Also, the minor son not only failed to communicate his alleged withdrawal but he also refused to inform the police that another minor was in the building. Thus, the minor son assisted the other minor in catching the deputy by surprise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife, who was indigent, had counsel appointed to represent her. She also wanted the trial court to appoint counsel to represent her husband, also indigent, whose whereabouts she did not know. In denying the application for mandamus, the court held that the trial court correctly refused to appoint counsel for the husband. The court held that due process only required that counsel be appointed for the wife, and that her court costs be provided for. As for the appointment of counsel to represent the adverse party, the court noted that to discharge his office fairly, such counsel would have to incur costs. The court observed that art. 5185 provided that no officer appointed by the trial court could be required to go out-of-pocket to discharge the office created by the appointment. Thus, the court reasoned, the counsel could rightfully refuse to fairly discharge his office, and the trial court could not compel him to do so. The court also noted that the trial court lacked authority to fund that counsel's activities from any other source.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the injunctive relief, made the writ peremptory, and ordered the appointees to replace the commissioners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed a law requiring that at all gasoline stations, only a competent attendant could dispense the gasoline to the customers. The oil company sued, claiming that the ordinance was illegal, and was improperly enforced only against it, since it was the only oil company that allowed the customers to self-serve the gasoline. The trial court found in the city's favor and the oil company appealed the ruling. The court held that an ordinance adopted by the city in the legitimate exercise of its police power will not be decreed to be void simply because it restricted the use of some improvements which the owner had lawfully constructed on the property prior to the adoption of that ordinance. The court stated that the city's ordinance requiring only attendants dispense gasoline was valid and reasonable, after a customer was injured when he was burned attempting to dispense his own gasoline. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the law did not violate the single subject rule under La. Const. art. 3, &sect;16, because the entire law encompassed only one subject. The court also determined that the law did not violate the title-body clause, since it gave the public fair notice of the scope of the legislation.

The trial court dismissed the lawsuit, and the attorney general appealed the ruling. The court held that the state constitution, in defining the duties of the attorney general, confines those duties to the state, as a distinct entity from its corporate agencies, and therefore he did not have any authority over state agencies. The court affirmed the lower court, concluding that the agencies could hire their own counsel, and therefore was not required to obtain the attorney general's approval before entering into a settlement agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police jury of a parish created an industrial district within the parish. The police jury then entered into a lease agreement with a corporation which provided that the district would acquire an industrial facility and lease the facility to the corporation, that the acquisition was to be financed by bonds issued by the district, and that the bonds were to be redeemed from amounts paid under the lease. The police jury then adopted a resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds and their sale at a private sale pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 39.991-1001. The police jury then brought an action for declaratory judgment that the bonds were legal obligations of the district. The trial court held that they were and defendants appealed. The court noted that a 1972 amendment of &sect;&sect; 39:991-1001 dispensed with the necessity of an election and allowed the private sale of bonds. The court held that because the sections of the statutes were part of the constitution and thus could only be amended by the procedure outlined in La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother complained of the judgment of the First Judicial District Court (Louisiana), which sustained appellee patrolman's motion for security for the payment of his attorney's fees in the defense of this action, and ordered the mother to furnish such bond within 30 days under penalty of a dismissal of her action. Upon her failure to post bond as directed, her suit as against the patrolman was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother sought to recover from appellee city and its patrolman damages for the death of her son occasioned through the alleged wrongful, unlawful, unprovoked, and unjustified shooting by the patrolman. The trial court granted the mother's motion to proceed under the pauper act as to court costs, but also granted the patrolman's motion for security for the payment of his attorney's fees in the event of a successful defense, and ordered the mother to show cause why she should not post bond. The court held that it was inconceivable that, because of the mother's poverty, she could ever furnish the security that she had been ordered to provide. The order was tantamount to a complete denial of her access to judicial process for the determination of the validity of her claim. This was an effective denial of the rights of due process and of equal protection under the law. The court held, therefore, that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:261(D), as interpreted and applied to the mother by the trial court, was clearly repugnant to the guarantees of the state and federal Constitutions of the rights of access to the courts and to the principles of equal protection under law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled, avoided, reversed, and set aside the judgment of the trial court, and ordered, adjudged, and decreed that plaintiff was authorized to continue to prosecute this cause without the payment or the giving of security for the payment of defendant officer's attorney's fees, and ordered that this cause be remanded to the First Judicial District Court for further proceedings in accordance with law and consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

Section 33.1 also delegated to the legislature certain authority to confer upon the commission certain additional powers, including the authority to incur debt and issue bonds therefor. The court ruled that authority to acquire industrial plant sites and buildings was an additional power not inconsistent with the constitutional amendment, given that the same power had already been granted to numerous other port commissions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessee challenged a decision from the Fifteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana) cancelling a mineral lease. The court held that the lessee failed to pay royalties for 19 months after oil production and cancelled the lease. The trial court refused to cancel those portions of the lease that were in production.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision that cancelled a mineral lease except for those portions of the lease that were in production, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court affirmed the cancellation of the lease and award of attorney fees to the heirs of a lessor and reversed the holding that the lessee was entitled to retain the producing lands. The court considered whether the death of a lessor relieved a lessee from paying the royalties required by the lease. The court concluded that it did not.  La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:105 was not suspended when the lessee withheld royalties on learning of the lessor's death. The court determined that although there was a bona fide title dispute as to who inherited from the lessor, there never had been a question as to the lessor's title to the property. Further, no provision of the mineral lease and no provision of law had been cited that allowed the lessees to withhold payment of royalties when a lessor died. Here, the lease provided an adequate and definite mode of payment. Failure to pay mineral royalties to a lessor was a grievous wrong that resulted in the harsh but necessary expedient of lease cancellation.</SPAN></P>

Predicated upon its gross sales from October 31 to December 31, the parish computed the occupational license assessment for the following calendar year. The method of computation utilized by the parish was identical to that prescribed by the state statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:398(A)(4), for businesses whose previous years' operations were less than one calendar year. The jewelry distributor attacked the constitutionality of this method of determining its gross annual sales for license tax purposes because the period chosen coincided with the peak period of its seasonal business, and represented 60 percent of its annual volume of sales, thus producing an inflated tax base. The trial court found the method constitutional. On review, the court held that, as provided in La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 10(1), where the constitutionality or legality of any tax levied by any parish was contested, appellate jurisdiction vested exclusively with the Supreme Court. The court therefore did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Accordingly, the appeal was transferred to the state Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an appeal from an order of the Louisiana Commission on Governmental Ethics. Appellant police captain was charged with violations of certain provisions of the Louisiana Code of Governmental Ethics. The commission originally ordered that the captain be suspended without pay for one month. On appeal, the punishment was increased to demotion without a possibility of promotion for one year, and next to a bar on promotion for six months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several appeals arose out of charges made by the ethics commission that the police captain violated provisions of the Louisiana Code of Governmental Ethics. At issue in this appeal was the punishment imposed by the commission on the captain. He was charged with having accepted a gift, gratuity, or favor, and for having solicited a loan as a favor. At first, the commission ordered that the captain be suspended without pay for one month. On one appeal, the commission ordered that the captain be demoted to the rank of lieutenant and that he not be promoted above that rank for one year. On a later appeal, the order was revised so that promotion was only barred for six months. In the absence of an impelling reason, a tribunal might not have imposed a more severe sentence after a new trial, inasmuch as the same would have been violative of due process of law guarantees. The principle of a free and unfettered right of review was equally applicable to an administrative proceeding involving property rights as it was to a proceeding involving one's liberty. As no impelling reason existed for the imposition of a greater penalty, the original suspension of one month was reinstated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the ethics commission was recalled, vacated and set aside, and judgment was rendered ordering the commission, pursuant to the authority vested in it by law, to order the Director of the Department of Public Safety to suspend the captain without pay for a period of one month. All costs that were legally assessable to the ethics commission were so assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant appealed the declaratory judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) that defendant city's home rule charter included the power to create a city court. He contended that the creation of the city court by home rule charter was unconstitutional because it went beyond the provisions of La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 40 and was nullified when a constitutional amendment to ratify it was defeated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens adopted a home rule charter that created a city court. A constitutional amendment to ratify and confirm the city court was proposed, but defeated. The claimant sought declaratory judgment that the city court was unconstitutional or that its jurisdictional limits were unconstitutional. The trial court found that the right to enforce local police, sanitary, and similar regulations included the right to create a city court. The claimant appealed. The court found that La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 51 specifically vested the power to create city courts in the legislature and prevailed over the generalities in art. XIV, &sect; 40. Thus, the legislature had full power to create the city court and did so. Ratifying and confirming the city court's creation by the home rule charter was tantamount to creating the city court, and in adopting La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:2488.21-2488.38, the legislature corrected any legal insufficiency. Yet, the jurisdictional amount in &sect; 13:2488.23 was higher than the constitutional limit, rendering the statute unconstitutional.  La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 4834 provided for a $ 1,000 jurisdictional limitation and also violated the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was amended to conform to the constitution's jurisdictional limit, and, as amended, it was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and ruled that &sect; 47:2183 did result in the cancellation of liens and mortgages but only all conventional and judicial mortgages. The court held that a vendor's lien and privilege was not one of the incumbrances on the property which the statute declared would be canceled as a result of the recordation of a tax deed. The court held that the purchaser received title to the property subject to this encumbrance which, notwithstanding the failure on the part of the delinquent taxpayer to redeem the property, remained in effect as a valid pre-existing vendor's lien and privilege pursuant to La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's brief stated that the issue to be resolved was whether the applicants intended in good faith to carry on a bona fide wholesale liquor business by selling to retail permittees in accordance with La.

The factual basis for the board's argument that the applicants did not in good faith intend to wholesale to retailers was a previous history of distribution only to a local chain of supermarkets in which the applicants both then had an interest. The court found that having previously surrendered a wholesale license because of their failure to meet the requirement of retail customers, the applicants could reasonably have been believed by the district court when they stated their intent to now meet that requirement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens brought separate action that were later consolidated. In their motion for summary judgment they argued the certificate of the assessor failed to indicate the assessed valuation of each of the signers of the petition for incorporation and had not stated the total assessed valuation of all immovable property within the proposed town. They further claimed that the governor did not have the proper information upon which to issue the proclamation declaring the municipality to be incorporated. Defendants in their motion for summary judgment argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:52 had not required a certificate from the registrar, and that they did more than was required by attaching the certificate to the petition for incorporation. The lower court granted the citizens' motion and defendants sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the highest total value of assessment listed by the petitioners was substantially less than that required under &sect; 33:52.

Ann. &sect; 34:2471 was unconstitutional in that it authorized the Commission to purchase such plants and the legislature had no authority to do so. The court held that La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was 14-years-old at the time of the hearing. The city court was created pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

The court rejected the juvenile's argument that a juvenile court must be created by the constitution or an amendment to the constitution and that the statute vesting of juvenile jurisdiction in the city court was unconstitutional. The court held that the creation of city or ward courts pursuant to the statute did not violate our traditional concept of the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Further, the court held that the city court was properly vested with authority to adjudicate the juvenile's manslaughter charge under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 52. As for the proceedings, the court found that (1) the trial court did not err in allowing the victim's father to view the entire proceedings, (2) the juvenile's statement that he shot the victim, in response to a police officer's question to a group, was properly admitted into evidence, and (3) the gun was properly preserved as an exhibit.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(5), was unconstitutionally administered by the Insurance Rating Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff issued an automobile insurance policy to defendant insured, which provided that disputes be settled by arbitration, but that pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(5), the arbitration was optional with defendant insured. Defendant insured was injured in a car accident, objected to the amount of insurance benefits offered by plaintiff, and chose to submit the matter to arbitration. Plaintiff then filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, the insured and the arbitrator, seeking a permanent injunction against the arbitration, and asking to have the statute declared unconstitutional as requiring a potestative clause in its policies. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiff. On appeal, the court held that since La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406(D)(5) gave plaintiff the option of whether or not to include arbitration in its policies, but gave defendant insured the option of accepting arbitration, the statute was not unconstitutional. Since plaintiff failed to comply with the statutory procedures of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 22:1 et seq., its challenge to the insurance regulations was ineffective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a registrar of voters of a parish, appealed an order of the trial court (Louisiana), which issued an order of mandamus to compel the registrar to comply with the provisions of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the registrar argued that La. Rev. Stat.

The registrar argued that the application of the state statute to state registered persons only and not federally registered persons was discriminatory and a denial of due process under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed the order of mandamus. The court held that the registrar, as a public official, could not attack the constitutionality of a statute that pertained to his official duties. The Act was not meant to supersede the requirements of age, residence, and voter identification prescribed by state law or supersede state laws not inconsistent with the federal constitution. The court found no conflicts between the Act and &sect; 18:1080, which was meant to insure that absentee voters resided and were domiciled in the parish.</SPAN></P>

Civ. Code Ann. art. 853. The district court fixed the boundary line in accordance with the plat of survey prepared by a surveyor who was appointed by the district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was uncontradicted that the original boundary line between the tracts of land of plaintiff and defendants was not established in accordance with the mandates of &sect; 833, as it was then written. Further, plaintiff had no part in employing the surveyor, in compensating him, or in constructing the fence in question. He did not consent to the boundary line and his acquiescence in its location was, at most, passive. Thus, the 10-year prescription in art. 853 was not applicable. However, the evidence was clear that the boundary was fixed in compliance with the present terms of art. 833. Because art. 833, as amended, defeated plaintiff's cause, but would not have done so prior to 1968, the court opined that a serious question of the constitutionality of the 1968 amendment was raised under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court declined to consider the question because it was not raised in the district court. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court in order that the proces verbal could be properly completed. The case was remanded so that either or both of the parties could plead the unconstitutionality of the statute, and for any other purpose that the district court deemed proper. Costs of the appeal were to be borne equally by the parties, and all other costs were to await the final outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Seeking to bring an appeal in a divorce action, the wife had sought an order permitting her to proceed in forma pauperis. The court held that the challenge to constitutionality of La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 5181 was properly before it because a formal plea of unconstitutionality was not necessary. The unconstitutionality of the article in question was sufficiently put at issue in the district court thereby providing the trial judge an opportunity to consider the merits of the claim. The court held that the portion of art. 5181, excluding separation and divorce matters from its applicability, was contrary to the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Where the state monopolized the means for legally dissolving marriage, due process prohibited a state from denying, solely because of inability to pay, individuals' access to the state courts. Accordingly, the court reversed the district court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grocery store sought review of a decision of the lower court (Louisiana), which denied its request or injunctive relief against defendants mayor, Town of Amite, the town marshal, and various town councilman. At issue was the constitutionality of a local ordinance which was used by defendants to prohibit plaintiff from operating a supermarket within the city limits of Amite on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff opened for business on a Sunday. The store manager was arrested and charged with violating Town of Amite, La., Ordinance No. 291, a Sunday Closing Law. The store manager was required to post a bond for his release. Plaintiff then obtained a temporary restraining order against further interference by the defendants and opened again on Sunday without incident. Plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction and defendants filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order. The lower court ruled that the temporary restraining order should be dissolved and the request for preliminary injunction dismissed. The court reversed finding that plaintiff met the criteria for the issuance of an injunction, namely, the clear invasion of a property right, threatened irreparable injury, and the manifest unconstitutionality of the ordinance. The court held the local ordinance was in contravention of La. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 51:191 and 51:192, which provided for Sunday closings and listed certain exemptions. The court found a supermarket selling groceries was encompassed by the term &quot;private markets&quot; such that it was specifically exempted from Sunday closing pursuant to state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court dismissing plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction was reversed on the basis that state law exempted grocery stores from Sunday closing law, thus, the local ordinance was in direct contradiction to state law in violation of La. Const. art. 14, &sect; 40(d).</SPAN></P>

The department of public safety argued that the truck driver was precluded from bringing the appeal because the appeal was not filed within the 30-day period provided in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:668.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The truck driver had been ordered to take the intoximeter test incident to his arrest upon a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence as prescribed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 32:661 to 32:669. The court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:668 clearly established a 30-day period in which review could be sought of the decision of the department of public safety to suspend a driver's license for failure to submit to the test prescribed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:661. The court held that &sect; 32:661 provided for adequate notice and opportunity for review and that no constitutional requirement of due process was contravened. The court held that it was unnecessary to address whether the 30-day period ran from the suspension date, date of mailing the required notice, or receipt of the notice. Assuming the position most favorable to the truck driver--that the delay provided ran from the date of receipt of notice--the truck driver's application was still untimely filed. Because the time limitation was a jurisdictional matter, the court dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the truck driver's appeal of the trial court's judgment, affirming the decision by the department of public safety to suspend the truck driver's license for six months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case arising from three consolidated class actions, plaintiff fire fighters association sought to have writs of mandamus issued directing defendant city to comply with the provision of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:1992 and 33:1996, contending that the city was in contempt for non-wilful disobedience of its mandate in two of the three cases. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fire fighters association filed a rule for contempt alleging that the city had not complied with the judgment of mandamus. The court found the city in contempt for non-wilful disobedience of its mandate in two cases. On appeal, the city argued that it could not be held in contempt because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1992 was unconstitutional and that it afforded the 30-day vacation period allowable as a maximum under the statute. The city also argued that the district court erred in dismissing its peremptory exceptions, in holding that the court did not have the legal authority to find the city guilty of contempt, in holding that the longevity mandamus order was not ambiguous, in relying on a stipulation that was based on errors, and in dismissing the city's motion to correct errors of calculation in the minimum salary mandamus. The court found that &sect; 33:1992 was constitutional. The court stated that the city was not in wilful disobedience and that the trial judge correctly overruled the exceptions because the motion did not set out specific action to be taken by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decision with respect to the interpretation of the statute. The court however reversed the judgment of contempt against the city in two cases and remanded to the trial court to fix a reasonable period of time for the city to comply with the judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fathers had sons who were members of an American Legion baseball team. The commission established a baseball league designed to secure participation in the program by as many boys and coaches as possible. The American Legion, however, had established leagues throughout the country for the special purpose of developing the better players who were between 15 and 18 years old. The American Legion's draft of boys from the recreation league disrupted the draft system. Accordingly, the commission adopted a rule that precluded 15 and 16-year-old boys on the American legion teams from playing in the recreation parks. The fathers contended that the rule was unconstitutional and sought an injunction. The trial court denied the claim. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the regulation was constitutional because the purposes of the rule were objective and were reasonably necessary to the recreation baseball program. The court concluded that the sons were not deprived from using the recreation parks as long as they played on recreation teams.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was elected nominee for Louisiana House of Representatives, district number 2, Caddo Parish, Louisiana. Plaintiff sought to have himself declared nominee, or in the alternative, have the election wherein defendant was elected, declared a nullity on the ground that defendant did not meet the residency requirements set forth in La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 9. Plaintiff's demands were rejected, and the decision was affirmed on appeal. The court held that defendant met the residency requirements of La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 9. It would have been patently unjust to deny defendant, who could qualify as a candidate for the legislature under the law as it existed prior to August 24, 1971, the right to qualify after August 24, 1971. La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 9 did not render defendant, who satisfied the requirements of Louisiana law prior to August 24, 1971, ineligible from qualifying as a candidate for the Louisiana House of Representatives so long as he actually resided in the newly created district as of the date of its creation on August 24, 1971.</SPAN></P>
