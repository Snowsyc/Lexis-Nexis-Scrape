</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, on behalf of her infant children, appealed a decision by the Appellate Division which held that the infant plaintiffs were not under a disability because of infancy within the meaning of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 208, thus their claims under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e were time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother timely filed notice of claim on behalf of each of her infant children pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e. Each claim alleged infant plaintiff ingested lead paint while living in defendant City-owned apartment. The trial court dismissed defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that the infancy toll under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 208 did not terminate when their parent filed a notice of claim on their behalf. The Appellate Division reversed, finding that infant plaintiffs were not under a disability because of infancy, thus their claims were time barred. The Court of Appeals reversed the Appellate Division, holding that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 208 tolled a statute of limitations for the period of infancy, and the toll was not terminated by the acts of a guardian or legal representative in taking steps to pursue the infant's claim. Therefore, the infant plaintiffs' suit against defendant City of New York was not time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed. Infant plaintiffs' claims against defendant city were not time-barred. Statute of limitations was tolled for infant plaintiffs' period of infancy, and the fact that their parent took steps to pursue claim on their behalf did not terminate tolling of statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - Tolling - Infancy - Toll Not Terminated by Acts of Guardian </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An infant's action against a municipality is not time-barred when the infant, through a parent or guardian, timely files a notice of claim pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e, but fails to commence the action within the one-year and 90-day limitation period of General Municipal Law &sect; 50-i.  The toll of a Statute of Limitations for the period of infancy afforded by CPLR 208 is not terminated by the acts of a guardian or legal representative in taking steps to pursue the infant's claim.  Although the language of CPLR 208 was amended in 1974 by dropping the use of age to define infancy and using the phrase &quot;disability because of infancy,&quot; the infancy disability is still measured by age and is not overcome when a parent, legal guardian or attorney takes steps to protect an infant's rights by filing a notice of claim, since the special status accorded an infant plaintiff by virtue of the infant's tender age has been consistently recognized, and that status is not altered by the action or inaction of the infant's parent or guardian. The amendment in question was part of a larger statutory revision changing the age of majority from 21 to 18, and there is no indication that the Legislature intended to change the application of the infancy toll. Moreover, a 1975 amendment to CPLR 208 creating a 10-year cap on the commencement of an infant's medical malpractice action was merely part of a larger package of legislative reforms having no relevance to the tolling statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - Tolling - Infancy - Toll Not Terminated by Acts of Guardian </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. An infant's action against a municipality is not time-barred when the infant, through a parent or guardian, timely files a notice of claim pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e, but fails to commence the action within the one-year and 90-day limitation period of General Municipal Law &sect; 50-i.  The toll of a Statute of Limitations for the period of infancy afforded by CPLR 208 is not terminated by the acts of a guardian or legal representative in taking steps to pursue the infant's claim.  Infant plaintiffs should not be penalized by a parent's compliance with section 50-e in an effort to protect a right to recovery. Infancy itself, the state of being &quot;a person [under] the age of eighteen&quot; (CPLR 105 [j]), is the disability that determines the toll. An interpretation of the infancy toll which measures the time period of infancy based on the conduct of the infant's parent or guardian cuts against the strong public policy of protecting those who are disabled because of their age.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant-State appealed the Appellate Division's (New York) order affirming the grant of summary judgment in plaintiffs' action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and a refund of gross receipt taxes paid, claiming that their U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought suit challenging constitutional validity of assessments on for-profit residential health care facilities' (RHCFs) gross receipts under a statutory scheme whereby those taxes on receipts for the care of Medicaid patients are reimbursed as a recoverable expense of care. The court held a) plaintiffs did not established disparities in tax burdens approaching the inequalities require; b) the Legislature had concrete facts upon which to conclude that an RHCFs' gross receipts tax should be structured to: (1) reduce the incentive for RHCFs to prefer admitting paying patients verses Medicaid patients; and (2) encourage those RHCFs to share the burden of providing skilled nursing home care for the medically indigent. A tax exemption for receipts from the care of Medicaid patients significantly related to and furthered the State's interest in securing equality of nursing home care for the indigent. Thus, the court held that tax scheme readily passed rational basis review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Nursing Homes - Gross Receipts Tax - Constitutionality of Statutory Scheme Reimbursing Nursing Homes for Taxes Paid on Receipts for Care of Medicaid Patients </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Assessments of 1.2% and 3.8% on the gross receipts of residential health care facilities (RHCFs) under a statutory scheme whereby those taxes on receipts for the care of Medicaid patients are reimbursed as a recoverable expense of care are constitutional (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2807-d [2] [b] [ii], [iii]; [10] [b]).  Even if the classifications in the gross receipts assessment statutes created a discrete class of nursing homes taxed disparately on the basis of their low proportions of medically indigent patients, plaintiffs, 21 for-profit RHCFs whose non-Medicaid population is larger than the State-wide average, have failed to establish any equal protection violation under the applicable rational basis level of judicial scrutiny, which permits a classification to be upheld if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a justification for the classification. Plaintiffs have not established disparities in tax burdens anywhere approaching the &quot;staggering&quot; inequalities upheld in other taxation cases by the United States Supreme Court.  The Legislature had concrete facts upon which reasonably to conclude that an RHCF gross receipts tax should be structured to reduce the incentive for higher quality-of-care RHCFs to prefer admitting patients who could finance their care from their own resources rather than Medicaid patients, and to encourage those RHCFs to share in the burden of providing skilled nursing home care for the medically indigent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Nursing Homes - Gross Receipts Tax - Constitutionality of Statutory Scheme Reimbursing Nursing Homes for Taxes Paid on Receipts for Care of Medicaid Patients </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Assessments on the gross receipts of residential health care facilities (RHCFs) under a statutory scheme whereby the taxes on receipts for the care of Medicaid patients are reimbursed as a recoverable expense of care are constitutional under the rational basis level of judicial scrutiny.  In identifying a legitimate State interest affording a rational basis for the claimed disparities in taxation among RHCFs, the State is not limited to the objectives of revenue-raising, Medicaid cost-shifting and cost-cutting, referred to in the legislative history, since nothing in the legislative history demonstrates that those objectives were exclusive.  Any reasonably conceivable legitimate State interest suffices to pass equal protection muster, and the relevant State interests need not have been the primary legislative objective.  Inasmuch as the challenged statutory provisions, essentially exempting Medicaid receipts from the RHCF gross receipts taxes, did not further the Legislature's cost containment or revenue-raising objective, the appropriate conclusion is not that the exemption is unconstitutional, but rather that the Legislature had other purposes in mind in enacting the exemption, namely, to mitigate the disincentive of higher quality-of-care RHCFs from admitting Medicaid patients and to encourage those nursing homes to share in the burden of caring for the medically needy.  The fact that efficiently and economically operated RHCFs catering to a Medicaid clientele can earn substantial profits at Medicaid reimbursement rates has little bearing on the rationality of a classification created to provide individual RHCFs with an incentive to care for the indigent. In any event, legislative choices are not subject to courtroom fact-finding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners appealed an order from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which determined that New York City Charter &sect; 1127 applies to nonresidents of the city who, as a result of a merger, were transferred from a public benefit corporation or authority to city agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were former members of the transit authority and housing authority police departments residing outside the city and were involuntarily transferred to the New York City Police Department via mergers. Prior to the mergers, petitioners were not city employees. Therefore, they were not subject to New York City Charter &sect; 1127, which required nonresident city employees, to agree to make payments in lieu of personal income taxes to the city in an amount computed and determined as if they were city residents. Petitioners sought declaratory and injunctive relief declaring that New York City Charter &sect; 1127 was unconstitutional as applied to them. The appellate division held that that because the employees were notified of the section yet nonetheless accepted employment with the city, they confirmed their agreement to abide by the provisions of &sect; 1127, they appealed, and this court reversed holding that the charter did not apply to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order reversed; none of petitioners entered into a pre-employment contract agreeing to pay the deductions, they involuntarily transferred to different departments under the city's aegis, thus the city could not impose the nonresident deductions upon them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Residence Requirement - Nonresident New York City Employees Involuntarily Transferred onto Municipal Payroll - Payments in Lieu of City Income Tax </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 1127 of the New York City Charter, which requires nonresident City employees, as a precondition of employment, to agree to make payments in lieu of personal income taxes to the City in an amount computed and determined as if they were City residents, does not apply to municipal employees who reside outside the City and were involuntarily transferred onto the municipal payroll via mergers into municipal agencies of the public benefit corporations or authorities for which they worked.  Section 1127, which explicitly applies to &quot;every person seeking employment,&quot; envisions a voluntary, pre-employment contract between a new employee and the City.  None of the petitioners entered into a pre-employment contract for section 1127 deductions; to the contrary, those employees, who had tenured civil service status at their previous agencies, were involuntarily and unilaterally transferred to different departments under the City's aegis.  The City therefore cannot impose the nonresident deductions upon them.  Moreover, petitioners had few options available to them once informed of the transfer: to suggest that they were required to quit their employment to protect their rights ignores the obvious.  Nor did petitioners waive any right to challenge the imposition of section 1127 when they cashed their paychecks and continued to work, since they protested the City's unilateral deductions in several ways, clearly illustrating that they did not acquiesce in the transfers.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged that a 9 percent rate of interest was excessive, bringing up for review the Appellate Division's prior order that the 9 percent rate applied to prejudgment interest awards in its condemnation proceedings. The 9 percent rate specified in N.Y. Unconsol. Law &sect; 2501 was applicable. N.Y. Unconsol. Law &sect;2501 entitled claimants to a presumptive 9 percent interest rate with respect to any judgment or accrued claim against a public corporation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prejudgment interest rate on property condemned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is 9% as provided by McKinney's Unconsolidated Laws of NY &sect; 2501.  Although Public Authorities Law &sect; 1276 (5) provides that the &quot;rate of interest to be paid by the [MTA] upon any judgment for which it is liable shall not exceed four per centum per annum,&quot; section 1276 is a consent to suit provision authorizing suit against the MTA in actions for &quot;damages, for injuries to real or personal property or for the destruction thereof,&quot; personal injuries or death, and not for constitutional claims for just compensation.  It is not section 1276, but the New York State Constitution that enables condemnees to bring suit against the MTA (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art I, &sect; 7 [a]).  Inasmuch as the State and its agencies are never immune from claims arising out of the exercise of their power of eminent domain, a consent to suit statute is inapposite to claims for just compensation.  In contrast to section 1276, McKinney's Unconsolidated Laws of NY &sect; 2501 entitles claimants to a presumptive 9% interest rate with respect to &quot;any judgment or accrued claim against&quot; a public corporation, and mirrors the statute applicable in condemnation proceedings against the State.  </SPAN></P>

Although the Legislature creates eligible lists, its discretion is limited to the field of enforcement of the constitutional Merit and Fitness Clause, and subdivision (3) goes beyond enforcement to create a new, retroactive remedy.  Appointment of an individual from a constitutionally valid expired list is unconstitutional, and the Legislature lacks the authority to override that constitutional barrier by passing a law specifically to negate that principle.  Job applicants who assert that they have been wrongly ruled ineligible for a position must attack the validity of the list in question, and when such a challenge is successful, a special eligible list may be available because the original list was never valid.  Because subdivision (3) substantially transforms a narrow remedy and makes special eligible lists available to any and all improperly disqualified applicants, regardless of the nature of their claim, it goes too far and breaches the constitutional barrier. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, legislators, sought a declaratory judgment seeking a declaration of unconstitutionality of 1998 N.Y. Laws 635 (N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5601(b)(2)). The challenged statute required the withholding of legislative salaries upon the first day of the fiscal year, until legislative passage of the budget had occurred. The trial court held that the statute violated the separation of powers doctrine and N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. On direct appeal, defendant, the state, asserted the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that the statute was not a facial abridgement of the constitutional protections and specifications regarding legislative salaries fixed by law. Nor did the law violate the separation of powers, for it did not impermissibly merge or shift the powers between the executive and legislative branches. Finally, the law did not create extortionate economic pressure, and caused no substantially different economic duress than in the ordinary lawmaking process, budget-related and otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Chapter 635 of the Laws of 1998, which provides that if the Legislature has not passed a State budget by the first day of any fiscal year, then the salaries of its members shall be withheld and not paid until legislative passage of a State budget has occurred, whereupon the legislators shall receive the pay which had been withheld, is not facially unconstitutional, does not violate article III, &sect; 6 of the State Constitution, and does not breach the governmental separation of powers doctrine.  In seeking facial nullification, plaintiffs, legislators who were in office and voted against chapter 635 and others who were not yet in office, bear the burden of demonstrating that in any degree and in every conceivable application, the challenged law suffers wholesale constitutional impairment; however, the Constitution lays no constraint on the authority of one Legislature by enactment of general law to make provision prospectively for allowances to be received by the officers and members of the two houses during a succeeding legislative term, and the withholding-of-salary protocol is general, purely prospective, and does not suffer from the potentiality that legislators' votes might be manipulated by promises of reward or threats of punishment effectuated through changes in salaries or allowances. Moreover, the statutorily authorized temporary withholding of net payments of legislative salaries operates by force of law and off a neutral pivot.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Statute Withholding Legislators' Salaries until State Budget is Passed - Fixing of Salaries by Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. By chapter 635 of the Laws of 1998, which provides that if the Legislature has not passed a State budget by the first day of any fiscal year, then the salaries of its members shall be withheld and not paid until legislative passage of a State budget has occurred, whereupon the legislators shall receive the pay which had been withheld, the Legislature prospectively &quot;fixed by law&quot; an annual salary for its members (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art III, &sect; 6).  The law imposes a discipline within the Legislative branch itself regarding the timing and method of only its own net compensation, and does not interject an all-or-nothing infirmity, because the &quot;contingent&quot; nature of its adopted timing-of-payment formula does not &quot;un-fix&quot; the salary, in constitutional terms.  The Legislature holds the constitutional key prospectively to authorize that legislators' salaries be paid in one final lump sum at the end of a legislative session--after the work of that branch has concluded and all its responsibilities discharged.  Since it may do that, it surely could do what chapter 635 prescribes, which is a lesser of the greater power.  This is particularly so since the release of net checks and realization of payment is accomplished simply by passage of an annual State budget, a principal constitutional duty prescribed for each legislative session. Thus, chapter 635 can in no way be viewed as a facial abridgement of the protections and specifications of article III, &sect; 6 of the State Constitution; on the contrary, it satisfies the constitutional payment mandate, and serves as an incentive to complete constitutional budget obligations in a timely fashion. </SPAN></P>

The Legislature, as a branch of government, must have &quot;finally acted on&quot; the appropriations submitted by the Governor before individual legislators may be paid, and that inducement does not require that the Legislature pass the Governor's budget; only that it pass some budget. The plaintiffs in this case, legislators who were in office and voted against chapter 635 and others who were not yet in office, sue as individuals, not as the Legislative branch of government; however, it is the correlative oversight of each lawmaking branch over one another--in essence a dependency, rather than a separation--that balances the overall power to protect the public's interests, not those individuals who occupy the offices of those branches at varying times. Although chapter 635 pinpoints a particular interdependence of the Legislature and Executive with respect to the budget-making process, it does not impermissibly merge or shift the powers between those two branches.  In the end, the Legislature always does the legislating.  It is institutional interdependence, rather than functional independence that best summarizes the idea of protecting liberty by fragmenting power.  </SPAN></P>

Its official work was done qua branch of the government, and the Legislature has decided to restrict itself and discipline its own work and power in this fashion; that is not a cognizable separation of powers problem.  Without a State budget or without messages of necessity and interim authorizations or continuing concurrent resolutions, no State expenditures could be made to anyone, including legislators.  Thus, after a fiscal year concludes, and until a new budget is passed for the following year, the payment of compensation to legislators is inescapably contingent and dependent upon the extant Executive's discretionary powers.  Chapter 635 does not create or result in &quot;extortionate economic pressure,&quot; since there is no substantially different economic duress created by chapter 635 than that which is inherent in the ordinary lawmaking process, budget-related and otherwise.  When the plaintiffs, legislators who were in office and voted against chapter 635 and others who were not yet in office, object to &quot;economic pressure,&quot; they are essentially attacking the fundamental, albeit rambunctious, realities of the political structure and process, including how public monies shall be allocated; however, no basis within the judicial review function supports the extraordinary superintendence and judicial nullification of chapter 635 that plaintiffs facially seek.  </SPAN></P>

By chapter 635, the Legislature has plainly confirmed the Comptroller's customary responsibility for ensuring the availability of revenues that would be expended through the enacted appropriations bills, and this reinforcement in no way authorizes the Comptroller to &quot;determine&quot; when legislators shall be paid.  Rather, that determination remains exclusively within the control, timing and power of the bicameral Legislature itself, acting as a branch of government when it enacts a timely budget, as is its constitutional duty. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The prosecutor's withdrawal of a case from the Grand Jury should not be deemed a dismissal requiring judicial intervention before the case may be submitted to another Grand Jury (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 190.75) where withdrawal resulted from the People's inability to produce a necessary witness prior to the end of the Grand Jury's term, little evidence of criminal conduct had been presented to the Grand Jury, and there was no evidence linking defendant to the commission of the crime.  Under limited circumstances, the withdrawal of a case is fundamentally inconsistent with the objectives underlying CPL 190.75 and, therefore, should be deemed a dismissal requiring judicial intervention before re-presentation.  The key factor in determining whether an unauthorized withdrawal of the case must be treated as a dismissal is the extent to which the Grand Jury considered the evidence and the charge.  Here, the Grand Jury did not consider the evidence and the charge against defendant.  The People presented only two witnesses, neither of whom linked defendant to the commission of this crime.  Nor can the Grand Jury's refusal to extend its term to enable the People to produce the unavailable witness be equated to a disapproval of the People's case or manipulation of the Grand Jury process.  Under these circumstances, the integrity of the Grand Jury proceedings was not impaired, and withdrawal of the case was not tantamount to a dismissal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Right to Jury Trial - Waiver </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial was not involuntary where defendant executed the written waiver after the Trial Judge's law clerk remarked to defendant's counsel that he agreed with counsel that defendant would be better off with a Bench trial, and that the Judge would certainly give him a fair trial.  While the law clerk's remarks to defense counsel were imprudent, the claimed assertion does not render defendant's decision to waive his right to a jury trial involuntary inasmuch as no promises as to either the determination of guilt or sentencing were made by the law clerk. A promise of favorable treatment that is not fulfilled may invalidate a defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial if reliance on that promise is objectively reasonable. Here, objectively viewed, at most there was a suggestion that the trial court would be a fair arbiter of the facts, and that this might be more than defendant could expect from a jury of his peers.  There was no actual promise of favorable treatment, and any expectation that defendant or his counsel may have harbored in this regard simply was not reasonable.  </SPAN></P>

Appellants argued the law was constitutional because it was enacted to achieve a lawful legislative objective.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Chapter 390 of the Laws of 1997, which enables a village, all of whose residents are members of a religious sect, to create a separate public school district for its disabled children, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution since it has the impermissible effect of advancing one religious sect and, thus, violates fundamental Establishment Clause neutrality principles.  Although chapter 390 sets forth facially neutral criteria, any attempt to characterize the statute as a religion-neutral law of general applicability is belied by its actual effect, which benefits only the village in question and one other of the State's 1,545 municipalities. In practical effect, therefore, the religious community of the village in question is not merely one in a series of many communities eligible for equal treatment under chapter 390; rather, since the statute's qualifying criteria are consciously drawn to benefit said village, other communities, both religious and secular, with similar educational needs will not have equal opportunity to create a publicly funded school district under the statute.  Thus, the nonneutral effect of the statute is to secure for one religious community a unique and significant benefit--a &quot;public school&quot; where all the students adhere to the tenets of a particular religion--unavailable to other, similarly situated communities.  Moreover, allowing only one other municipality to qualify under the statute does not render it a general, religion-neutral law.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Chapter 390 of the Laws of 1997, which enables a village, all of whose residents are members of a religious sect, to create a separate public school district for its disabled children, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution since it has the effect of advancing one religion over another and constitutes an impermissible religious accommodation. Although the statute neither provides public aid to a parochial school nor prescribes religious practices for a public school, it delegates to a religious group the governmental power to form its own public school district, which carries with it vast powers.  All Establishment Clause constitutional standards build upon the same foundation, fundamental neutrality principles, and to consider whether a statute has the impermissible effect of advancing one religion or constitutes an impermissible religious accommodation is essentially to examine both sides of a coin; under either inquiry, a statute so narrowly drawn that it delegates a significant governmental power almost exclusively to a single religious group, and provides no assurance that the statute's benefits will be equally available to others, is unconstitutional.  In light of the events surrounding the enactment of chapter 390 and its legislative history, it is clear that the statute does not constitute a permissible religious accommodation; the class benefitted under it is anything but broad.  Given the statute's applicability to only two municipalities, one of which is a religious sect clearly intended to be the statute's beneficiary, the secular effect of it is virtually indiscernible.  </SPAN></P>

According to the court, the organizational plaintiffs, including an organization for social workers and an organization for individuals receiving services from social workers, failed to allege cognizable harm to their members. Also, the claims did not demonstrate a sufficient nexus to fiscal activities of the state to allow for citizen-taxpayer standing under N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 123-b.

In an action challenging the Governor's authority to implement an Executive Order that established the Governor's Office of Regulatory Reform (GORR), which permits gubernatorial appointees to effectively block rules proposed by executive agencies, the organizational plaintiffs representing social workers lack standing to challenge the disapproval by GORR of a proposed regulatory change which would have required the director of each organized social work department in an urban hospital to hold a master's degree in social work (MSW), since they have failed to allege any cognizable harm to their members.  Although some holders of MSW's will not have the benefit of increased job prospects because GORR blocked the proposed rule change, that does not mean that any one individual member of plaintiff organizations has been or will be injured, since the organization members who hold MSW's are neither prohibited from seeking a certain portion of available jobs, nor deprived of monies to which they may be statutorily entitled.  Rather, they are merely not given preference over those who do not hold an MSW degree, and at best, this amounts to only &quot;tenuous&quot; and &quot;ephemeral&quot; harm, which is insufficient to trigger judicial intervention. </SPAN></P>

In an action challenging the Governor's authority to implement an Executive Order that established the Governor's Office of Regulatory Reform (GORR), which permits gubernatorial appointees to effectively block rules proposed by executive agencies, the organizational plaintiffs representing social workers lack standing to challenge the disapproval by GORR of a proposed regulatory change which would have required the director of each organized social work department in an urban hospital to hold a master's degree in social work (MSW), since the interests of the organizations representing MSW's are not entirely germane to the relief they seek in this litigation.  These organizations have failed to identify any statutory or constitutional provision intended to prevent economic injury resulting from decreased employment opportunities, and neither organizational plaintiff is alleged to represent solely individuals with MSW's.  As a result, it cannot be said that the interests of the organizations dovetail with the claims they put forth here.  By seeking to enhance job opportunities of only some of their members--those holding MSW's--these groups implicitly seek to diminish job opportunities for other of their members--those otherwise qualified social workers who do not hold MSW's, and this imperfect alignment of interests, when considered along with the negligible injury asserted, leads to the conclusion that these organizations lack standing.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action challenging the Governor's authority to implement an Executive Order that established the Governor's Office of Regulatory Reform (GORR), which permits gubernatorial appointees to effectively block rules proposed by executive agencies, the organizational plaintiffs representing persons who receive social work services lack standing to challenge the disapproval by GORR of a proposed regulatory change which would have required the director of each organized social work department in an urban hospital to hold a master's degree in social work, since their allegations of specific injury are tenuous. Although a principal purpose of these organizations is improving care for their members, which includes improving social work services, these organizations fail to point to a specific harm to any of their members which could be attributed to the disapproval of the proposed rule. Indeed, plaintiffs do not claim that any one person has suffered, but rather assert conclusorily that the delivery of social work could be better if the proposed rule were allowed to go forward.  Without an allegation of injury-in-fact, plaintiffs' assertions are little more than an attempt to legislate through the courts.  Furthermore, this is not a case where to deny standing to these plaintiffs would insulate government action from judicial scrutiny, since other actions by GORR may trigger the specific harm necessary to confer standing, and the Legislature retains its power to address the Executive Order in question.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In an action challenging the Governor's authority to implement an Executive Order that established the Governor's Office of Regulatory Reform (GORR), which permits gubernatorial appointees to effectively block rules proposed by executive agencies, plaintiff, as a taxpayer, lacks standing under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b to challenge the disapproval by GORR of a proposed regulatory change which would have required the director of each organized social work department in an urban hospital to hold a master's degree in social work, since plaintiff essentially seeks to obtain judicial scrutiny of the State's nonfiscal activities.  Inasmuch as most activities can be viewed as having some relationship to expenditures, too broad a reading of section 123-b would create standing for any citizen who had the desire to challenge virtually all governmental acts.  Plaintiff's claims regarding GORR's nonfiscal rule-making review function do not demonstrate a sufficient nexus to fiscal activities of the State to allow for standing under the statute.  </SPAN></P>

The individual plaintiff and two organizations lack standing, as voters, to challenge the Governor's authority to implement an Executive Order that established the Governor's Office of Regulatory Reform, which permits gubernatorial appointees to effectively block rules proposed by executive agencies.  Plaintiffs point to no specific constitutional provision having a connection to the franchise and no statute even tangentially related to the right to vote. Although, in some circumstances, allegations of governmental action impinging upon the constitutional separation of powers may bear so heavily on the right to vote as to dilute or impair it, plaintiffs raise no claim of injury fairly attributable to the sphere of voting rights.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents sought review from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order granting a motion by petitioner to compel compliance with certain nonjudicial subpoenas, and directing respondents to comply with the subpoenas in an action involving the state comptroller's power to investigate the efficiency of New York City agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought to conduct performance audits of New York City agencies. The supreme court and appellate division concluded that petitioner had authority to perform such audits. On appeal, respondents contended that use of the word &quot;accounts&quot; in the state constitution and statutes governing petitioner's powers limited his auditing authority to financial matters. The court acknowledged that neither source specifies what type of audits the comptroller may conduct. But it said the key constitutional phrase in N.Y. Const. art. V &sect; 1, which empowered the legislature to assign to the comptroller supervision of the accounts of any municipality, left ample room for wider inquiry by the comptroller. Moreover, N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect;&sect; 33 and 34 authorized the comptroller to inquire into the financial condition and resources of a municipality. Although the statutes did not expressly permit or preclude performance audits, the court said, clearly these powers go beyond the verification of financial records and internal controls.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, which upheld the state comptroller's power to investigate the efficiency of New York City agencies, ordering respondents to comply with 17 subpoenas for information on an array of programs.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Comptroller - Authority to Conduct Performance Audits of New York City Agencies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The State Comptroller has the authority to conduct performance audits of New York City agencies, which examine the performance of government organizations, programs, activities or functions, in order to provide information to improve public accountability and facilitate decision making by parties with responsibility to oversee or initiate corrective action, because the State has far-reaching responsibility for programs and services of its political subdivisions, each year appropriating significant public monies to local governments, and the Comptroller, as the State's chief fiscal officer, is a vital part of the constitutional machinery for assuring accountability in the expenditure of those funds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Comptroller - Constitutional Authority to Conduct Performance Audits of New York City Agencies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. NY State Constitution, article V, &sect; 1 broadly empowers the Legislature to delegate to the Comptroller both supervision of the accounts of any political subdivision of the State and administrative duties incidental thereto, and it cannot be said that the meaning of &quot;accounts&quot;, as well as &quot;supervision of accounts&quot;, is so plain and precise as to signify financial audits and prohibit performance audits. It is hard to think of a situation in which incompetence or laxity so general as to amount to proof of method will not also have direct relation to the accounts of the department or office subject to the criticism, since the wages of the assistants are wastefully expended if reasonably efficient service is not rendered in return.  Accordingly, the Comptroller is not precluded from inquiring into the efficiency and effectiveness of the City's expenditure of State funds, and the authority to supervise the accounts of the State's political subdivisions leaves ample room for wider inquiry by the Comptroller. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Comptroller - Constitutional Authority to Conduct Performance Audits of New York City Agencies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. NY State Constitution, article V, &sect; 1 gives the State Comptroller the authority to conduct performance audits of New York City agencies, and constitutional history does not evince an intent to limit the Comptroller's authority to conducting financial audits; rather, the Comptroller's authority to supervise &quot;accounts&quot; mentioned in that section has never been confined to examinations of a municipality's financial records, but has included the broader inquiry contemplated by performance audits. Article V, &sect; 1 had as its object the protection of the independent character of the Comptroller's audit function, was not intended as a limit to that core function, and permits the delegation of authority to conduct performance audits of political subdivisions of the State.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Comptroller - Statutory Authority to Conduct Performance Audits of New York City Agencies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The State Comptroller has the authority to conduct performance audits of New York City agencies.  Although the General Municipal Law neither explicitly authorizes nor prohibits such audits, sections 33 and 34 thereof expressly authorize the Comptroller to examine the accounts of all municipal officers to inquire into the &quot;financial condition,&quot; &quot;resources&quot; and &quot;method and accuracy of [the] accounts&quot; of any municipal corporation, and to examine into its &quot;financial affairs.&quot; Those powers go beyond the verification of financial records and internal controls.  The history of the statutes, moreover, unambiguously demonstrates that the Legislature expected the State Comptroller might conduct audits into the effective use of State funds by political subdivisions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State - Comptroller - Statutory Authority to Conduct Performance Audits of New York City Agencies </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The State Comptroller has the authority to conduct performance audits of New York City agencies, and it cannot be said that because the New York City Comptroller has the explicit authority under the New York City Charter to conduct such audits, the Legislature did not intend to duplicate those powers, since the provision of the Charter granting such authority was enacted by the people of the City and as such did not displace the State Comptroller's authority under General Municipal Law &sect;&sect; 33 and 34.  Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that the State Legislature intended that performance audits of the City would be conducted exclusively by the City Comptroller. In 1985, the Legislature established the Office of the Deputy Comptroller for the City of New York as a permanent division within the Office of the State Comptroller, unambiguously evidencing its intention that the State Comptroller have the power to inquire into the operations of the City and its agencies irrespective of the City Comptroller's coextensive powers.  Finally, the City concedes that the State Comptroller is authorized to conduct financial audits of City agencies--a duty similarly assigned by the City Charter to the City Comptroller. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court held that defendants violated plaintiff judges' equal protection rights by causing plaintiffs to be paid less than their counterpart judges in another county. The lower court also held that plaintiffs' similar claims regarding disparity in the salaries of judges in two other counties were accordingly moot. The court on appeal determined that because N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 221-d prescribed and varied the pay of the judges of the county courts on the basis of geographical location, it was required to pass only rational basis review to be upheld as constitutional. The court found that defendants had submitted data that provided a rational basis for the disparity in pay between plaintiffs and the judges of the other county court. The court therefore rejected the lower court's &quot;totality of economic indicators&quot; test as contrary to the essential governing rational basis test. The court held that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, dismissing plaintiffs' second cause of action as it related to the pay disparity between plaintiffs and their counterpart county court judges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment which declared unconstitutional the pay disparity between plaintiff judges and judges of another county was reversed.

Data submitted by defendants indicating that median home values were nearly 50% higher in Albany County than in Erie County, and that Albany County Court Judges have larger case loads per Judge than Erie County Court Judges provide a rational basis for the 4.6% disparity in pay between plaintiffs and the Judges of the Albany County Court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed, by permission of a justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), from an order of that court that affirmed a judgment of the Albany County Court (New York) rendered upon a verdict convicting defendant of various criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in not sua sponte ordering a competency hearing. On appeal, the instant court stated that a defendant was presumed to be competent, and was not entitled as a matter of right to have the question of his capacity to stand trial passed upon before the commencement of the trial. The court stated that a report certifying defendant competent to proceed to trial contained the most recent opinion of a psychiatrist who examined defendant for the purpose of determining competency to stand trial, and was therefore entitled to significant weight. The report explicitly stated that defendant had satisfactory knowledge of courtroom procedure and the duties of court officials. Moreover, defendant clearly indicated that he understood his right to be present in the courtroom and consult with counsel. At no time after defendant was certified as competent did defense counsel raise the issue of defendant's fitness to proceed or request an examination pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law 730.30.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court affirmed the decision of the court below, which affirmed a judgment of the trial court rendered upon a verdict convicting defendant of various criminal charges, on the grounds that the trial judge was within his discretion in making the requisite judicial determination that no competency hearing was required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Fitness to Proceed to Trial - Discretion of Court to Order Competency Hearing Sua Sponte </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the prosecution of defendant, who was found to be competent by the institution where he was initially committed pursuant to a temporary order of observation, the trial court did not abuse its discretion as a matter of law by failing, on its own, to order a competency hearing under CPL article 730, notwithstanding that a psychiatrist who conducted a CPL 250.10 (3) examination to determine whether defendant lacked responsibility due to mental disease or defect at the time of the crime opined in his report that defendant was not fit to proceed to trial. CPL 730.30 (1) provides that the court wherein the criminal action is pending must issue an order of examination when it is of the opinion that the defendant may be an incapacitated person.  Pursuant to CPL 730.60 (2), in cases where, as here, the institution in which a defendant has been confined has determined that the defendant is no longer incapacitated, the court may, on its own motion, conduct a hearing to determine the issue of capacity, and it must conduct a hearing upon motion therefor by the defendant or by the District Attorney. A Trial Judge determining whether a competency hearing is necessary may consider expert medical proof available to him, coupled with all other evidence and his own observations of the defendant.  Here, the psychiatric report certifying defendant competent to proceed to trial contained the most recent opinion of a psychiatrist who examined defendant for the purpose of determining competency to stand trial, and therefore was entitled to significant weight.  The Trial Judge additionally could consider his progressive personal observations of defendant, and continued to monitor defendant's understanding of his rights and the proceedings against him throughout the duration of the trial, even though defendant himself did not appear in court of his own volition.  Further, at no time after defendant was certified as competent did defense counsel, who was in the best position to assess defendant's capacity, raise the issue of defendant's fitness to proceed or request an examination pursuant to CPL 730.30.  Moreover, many of the findings in the CPL 250.10 (3) report themselves satisfy the legal standard of fitness to proceed and, thus, undercut that report's conclusions that defendant was incapable of rational participation in court proceedings and was not fit to proceed to trial. </SPAN></P>

Bench trials were not permitted in capital cases and the Act barred imposition of a death sentence upon a guilty plea. New York law thus explicitly provided two levels of penalty for the same offense, imposing death only on those who asserted innocence and proceeded to trial.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Constitution ality of Plea Bargain Provisions of Death Penalty Statute - CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and 220.30 (3) (b) (vii)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The provisions of New York's death penalty statute which afford a defendant the opportunity to ensure a maximum sentence of life without parole by pleading guilty &quot;with both the permission of the court and the consent of the people when the agreed upon sentence is either life imprisonment without parole or a term of imprisonment for the class A-I felony of murder in the first degree other than a sentence of life imprisonment without parole&quot; ( CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]) are unconstitutional.  New York's death penalty statute explicitly provides for the imposition of the death penalty only upon a jury verdict and, therefore, only those defendants who exercise the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial put themselves at risk of death.  The chilling effect on a defendant's exercise of those Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights is unnecessary and therefore excessive.  The United States Supreme Court has found approval of the trial court and prosecutor is irrelevant to the constitutional analysis inasmuch as the statute's infirmity is not coercion of guilty pleas and jury waivers but needless encouragement of them.  Further, while plea bargaining is permissible, statutes, such as New York's, that needlessly encourage guilty pleas, which are not constitutionally protected, by impermissibly burdening constitutional rights are prohibited.  Nor does the bifurcated capital trial procedure in New York, by which a jury that finds a defendant guilty determines the sentence in a separate proceeding (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 400.27), alleviate the constitutional infirmity, since bifurcation does not eliminate the statutory framework that allows the possibility of death only after a jury trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Severability of Unconstitutional Plea Bargain Provisions of Death Penalty Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The declaration of unconstitutionality of the provisions of New York's death penalty statute which afford a defendant the opportunity to ensure a maximum sentence of life without parole by pleading guilty ( CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]) does not require invalidation of the entire death penalty statute. It is clear from the face of the statute that the very purpose of the Legislature and Governor in enacting the statute was to provide for capital punishment in New York.  The statute's severability clause (L 1995, ch 1, &sect; 37) indicates that the lawmakers would not have wanted the entire statute to fail if the particular provisions regarding pleas were declared unconstitutional. Nor is invalidation of the death penalty necessary to obviate the constitutional infirmity: excision of the capital pleading provisions eliminates the prohibited burden on constitutional rights. Furthermore, the plea provisions are discrete, and by no means vital to the remainder of the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Constitution ality of Plea Bargain Provisions of Death Penalty Statute - CPL 220.60 (2) (a)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.  CPL 220.60 (2) (a), which allows defendants who have pleaded not guilty to any indictment to withdraw the plea before a verdict, subject to certain limitations, need not be declared unconstitutional as a result of the declaration of unconstitutionality of the provisions of New York's death penalty statute which afford a defendant the opportunity to ensure a maximum sentence of life without parole by pleading guilty ( CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]).  While CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and 220.30 (3) (b) (vii) relate exclusively to pleas in first degree murder cases and &quot;needlessly&quot; encourage guilty pleas, CPL 220.60 (2) (a) is not limited to first degree murder cases, and is, therefore, constitutional in the absence of the other two unconstitutional provisions.  Therefore, only CPL 220.10 (5) (e) and 220.30 (3) (b) (vii) must be stricken.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Effect of Unconstitutionality of Plea Bargain Provisions of Death Penalty Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In light of the declaration of unconstitutionality and severance of the provisions of New York's death penalty statute which afford a defendant the opportunity to ensure a maximum sentence of life without parole by pleading guilty ( CPL 220.10 [5] [e]; 220.30 [3] [b] [vii]), a defendant may not plead guilty to first degree murder under the resulting statute while a notice of intent to seek the death penalty is pending.  However, excision of the unconstitutional provisions does not prevent pleas of guilty to first degree murder when no notice of intent to seek the death penalty is pending, since defendants in that situation face the same maximum sentence regardless of how they are convicted. Nor does excision of the provision prevent pleas of guilty to offenses not punishable by death, even when a notice to seek the death penalty is pending.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the dismissal of plaintiff shopping paper's complaint, plaintiff contended that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1115(i)(C) was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the constitutionality of the statute but modified the order to grant judgment to defendant tax commissioner, rather than dismiss plaintiff's complaint. First, the imposition of the sales tax at issue was not directed at the press in general, but was one of general application. Further, the 90 percent rule, which was designed to ensure that at least 10 percent of an exempt publication would be devoted to news of general interest, did not enforce any differential treatment based on the content of ideas or viewpoints expressed in plaintiff's paper. The legislature validly chose to decline to subsidize shopping papers that failed to serve community interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 1115 (i) (C), which conditions entitlement to the shopping paper sales tax exemption on whether advertising comprises not more than 90 percent of the printed area, is constitutional.  The tax from which the exemption is available is one of general application, levied against virtually all final sales of products and services.  Neither the print media in general, nor shopping papers in particular, are singled out for special treatment.  Other forms of published commercial speech which are distributed free of charge, including shopping catalogs, advertising flyers and shopping center advertising sheets, do not enjoy any sales tax exemption for purchases of printing services (Tax Law &sect; 1115 [i] [D]).  Further, a taxpayer can readily qualify for the exemption. Moreover, the 90 percent rule does not enforce any differential treatment based on the content of ideas or viewpoints expressed in a shopping paper.  Absent invidious discrimination, the Legislature can pick and choose between the forms of expression it decides to subsidize through a tax exemption. The Legislature may validly decline to subsidize shopping papers which fail to serve at least minimally the same social purpose as a conventional newspaper by informing the public in matters of community interest, rather than exclusively commercial interest.  </SPAN></P>

For standing to sue, petitioners must show that they have suffered an injury in fact, distinct from that of the general public. Moreover, petitioners must demonstrate that the injury claimed falls within the zone of interests to be protected by the statute challenged.  Here, because petitioner had no direct stake in the outcome of the bidding process, it did not suffer an injury in fact.  Although it stood to lose remuneration for services performed under the pre-EBTS arrangement, that would be the case no matter who was awarded the contract.  The injury suffered arose from the decision to have the EBTS, not from the procurement process to determine who would implement it.  Additionally, petitioner's alleged injury is not within the zone of interests protected by State Finance Law &sect; 163.  The procurement process of the State, governed by State Finance Law article 11, exists to &quot;promote purchasing from responsive and responsible offerers ... based on clearly articulated procedures&quot; (State Finance Law &sect; 163 [2]), but petitioner was not an offerer within the meaning of section 163 and acknowledged that it did not have the capacity to be a bidder and prime responsible contractor for this project.  </SPAN></P>

For standing to sue, petitioners must show that they have suffered an injury in fact, distinct from that of the general public. Moreover, petitioners must demonstrate that the injury claimed falls within the zone of interests to be protected by the statute challenged.  Petitioner, as a subcontractor and member of the &quot;team&quot; assembled to implement the contract, if awarded to the bidder, may be viewed as having suffered a potential economic injury, distinct from the public at large, because it lost the opportunity to perform work on the EBTS contract, and to benefit financially.  Petitioner, however, is not within the zone of interests protected by State Finance Law &sect; 163 because it was not a bidder or offerer under State Finance Law article 11.  Allowing any entity to bring suit based upon its status as a &quot;bidding team member&quot; would confer standing for far too many potential litigants and allow those whose interests are only marginally related under State Finance Law &sect; 163 concerns to assert collateral challenges.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioners' claims are not of the kind for which State Finance Law &sect; 123-b confers standing, inasmuch as they do not argue that the Department of Social Services acted outside its authority in issuing an RFP seeking bidders for an EBTS but, rather, take issue with the procurement procedures followed.  </SPAN></P>

Respondent filed a writ of habeas corpus to block the transfer, claiming that she had a right to a judicial hearing prior to a nonemergency transfer. The state supreme court declared that a judicial hearing was required prior to transfer. The case was appealed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A combined habeas corpus proceeding and declaratory judgment action commenced on behalf of an involuntarily committed civil patient hospitalized at a civil mental health facility of the State Office of Mental Health (OMH), which seeks to block her transfer to a secure OMH facility or to obtain her release alleging that she had a right to a judicial hearing prior to a nonemergency transfer to a secure OMH facility will not be dismissed as moot because Supreme Court has ordered her release.  Even if the patient's present status renders the case moot as to her, the exception to the mootness doctrine for issues that are likely to recur applies.  The Mental Hygiene Law contemplates that involuntary hospitalization in a mental health facility is often brief and temporary.  That statute and its implementing regulations require frequent periodic review of a patient's status, and the release of the patient unless OMH is granted successive court orders authorizing retention (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.33; 14 NYCRR 57.4 [b]).

The transfer of an involuntarily committed civil patient hospitalized at a civil mental health facility of the State Office of Mental Health (OMH) to a secure OMH facility, where all patients are subject to heightened security irrespective of their conduct and where a high percentage of the patients have been transferred from the criminal justice system as incompetent to stand trial (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL art 730) or are committed as a result of having been found not criminally responsible by reason of mental disease or defect (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 330.20), implicates a liberty interest which triggers rights to procedural due process because the stigma of being a patient at the secure facility may be greater than that of being hospitalized at the civil mental health facility.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a proceeding involving the potentially stigmatizing transfer of an involuntarily committed civil patient hospitalized at a civil mental health facility of the State Office of Mental Health (OMH) to a secure OMH facility, the requirements of due process were satisfied with respect to petitioner's liberty interest. The patient is being transferred to an OMH facility, not a correctional facility, and prior to the transfer request she was already confined to the Intensive Psychiatric Service unit of the nonsecure facility and her behavior required periods of enforced seclusion. Moreover, the secure facility permits freer movement of patients such as petitioner who require close supervision (14 NYCRR 57.1).  Thus, petitioner has not established that her liberty interest was as severely affected as it would be by transfer to a penal, security-oriented facility operated by the Department of Correctional Services.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insane and Other Incompetent Persons - Involuntary Commitment - Due Process of Law - Risk of Erroneous Deprivation of Liberty Interest of Civil Patient Transferred from Nonsecure to Secure Facility </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a proceeding involving the potentially stigmatizing transfer of an involuntarily committed civil patient hospitalized at a civil mental health facility of the State Office of Mental Health (OMH) to a secure OMH facility, the record does not substantiate the existence of any serious risk of an erroneous deprivation of the patient's liberty interest under the current transfer procedures of the Mental Hygiene Law and regulations such as would violate due process.  Under the regulatory scheme, the transfer decision is primarily one of professional medical judgment as to the most appropriate therapeutic setting (14 NYCRR 57.1), and a patient for whom an application has been made has the rights of notice and complete disclosure of the documents submitted with the application, is afforded legal representation at all stages of the administrative process, and is entitled to a full review of the transfer by a qualified independent psychiatrist. At each stage, the patient and the patient's representative are entitled to submit opposing arguments and any pertinent countervailing evidence.  The record does not substantiate the existence of any serious risk that these procedures give rise to erroneous transfer determinations.  Nor has there been a showing that the additional safeguard of a judicial hearing would significantly reduce the possibility of an erroneous transfer decision.  Shifting from mental health professionals to Judges the determination of which therapeutic environment is most appropriate would not significantly add assurance against the risk of an erroneous decision.  Moreover, in the case of a violent mentally ill patient, security concerns are inextricably linked to considerations of professional medical judgment, and it is not the province of the courts to weigh the degrees of medical and security considerations which may go into any individual transfer decision.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a proceeding involving the potentially stigmatizing transfer of an involuntarily committed civil patient hospitalized at a civil mental health facility of the State Office of Mental Health (OMH) to a secure OMH facility, the procedures required by 14 NYCRR part 57 satisfy the requirements of procedural due process in all respects, notwithstanding the lack of a judicial hearing prior to the nonemergency transfer to a secure OMH facility.  The government in this case has a strong interest in avoiding the significant administrative and fiscal burdens which would result from the necessity of holding a prior judicial hearing each time an involuntary patient objects to being transferred to a secure facility. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insane and Other Incompetent Persons - Involuntary Commitment - Equal Protection of Laws - Different Procedures for Determining Appropriateness of Transfer Decisions for Civil and Criminal Patients at Mental Health Facilities </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. An involuntarily committed civil patient hospitalized at a civil mental health facility of the State Office of Mental Health (OMH), who was transferred, without a judicial hearing, to a secure OMH facility due to a substantial risk that she might cause physical harm to other persons (14 NYCRR part 57), was not denied equal protection because persons found not responsible for criminal conduct by reason of mental disease or defect are entitled to a judicial hearing under CPL 330.20 for purposes of determinations of whether they suffer from a dangerous mental disorder or are otherwise mentally ill. Since 14 NYCRR part 57 and CPL 330.20 address different classes of persons posing different legal concerns, a rational basis exists for having different procedures to determine the appropriateness of transfer decisions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, competitors of Indian retailers, and petitioners, commissioner of state taxation and finance department and others, cross appealed from an order of Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed judgments directing equal enforcement of state's tax law respecting tobacco and fuel sales.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York Tax Law imposed sales and excise taxes on tobacco and motor fuel sales. Federal law forbade collection of these taxes on goods sold on Indian reservations to tribal members. However, when the goods were sold on the reservation to non-Indian consumers, the taxes could be collected. The tax department promulgated regulations to facilitate collection of these taxes on reservation sales. However, it did not enforce the regulations. The competitors then filed the present suit. The court held the appellate court erred in applying the high degree of scrutiny reserved for governmental classifications based on race to the tax department's nonenforcement policy. The unique legal status of Indian tribes permitted the federal government to enact laws singling out tribal Indians even where those laws might otherwise be constitutionally offensive and the states could adopt policies to effectuate such federal laws. The tax department's specialized treatment of on-reservation tobacco and motor fuel sales was such a policy. The court held the record did not provide a basis for determining whether the tax department's nonenforcement policy was sustainable on a rational basis standard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioners, non-Indian reservation convenience stores and their representative associations, have standing to challenge a policy of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance forbearing from the collection of cigarette and motor fuel taxes as applied to sales made to non-Indian consumers on Indian reservations located within the State.  Petitioners' grievance is essentially an equal protection claim based on differential enforcement of the tax laws and, as members of the disadvantaged class, petitioners have a right to seek judicial resolution of that claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Enforcement of Taxing Statutes and Regulations against On-Reservation Retailers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A policy of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance forbearing from the collection of cigarette and motor fuel taxes as applied to sales made to non-Indian consumers on Indian reservations located within the State does not constitute a form of race-based discrimination subject to the demanding &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; analysis.  The unique legal status of Indian tribes permits the Federal Government to enact legislation singling out tribal Indians even where that legislation might otherwise be constitutionally offensive.  Federal preferences may be granted to Indians not as a discrete racial group, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal entities. While States do not enjoy the same unique relationship, they may adopt laws and policies to reflect or effectuate Federal laws designed to readjust the allocation of jurisdiction over Indians without opening themselves to the charge that they have engaged in race-based discrimination.  The Tax Department's specialized treatment of on-reservation cigarette and motor fuel sales is clearly such a policy, since it is predicated on the Department's sensitivity to both tribal sovereignty issues and the complex restrictions imposed by the Indian Trader Laws.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Academic and Moot Questions - Postargument Repeal of Challenged Regulations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance's policy of forbearance from the collection of cigarette and motor fuel taxes as applied to sales made to non-Indian consumers on Indian reservations located within the State, in which respondents initially took the position in their arguments to the Court of Appeals that the Tax Department's policy of restraint was, in essence, a temporary measure adopted during a period of delicate negotiations in order to avoid actions that could be construed as &quot;a direct affront&quot; to the sovereign status of Indian nations and tribes, the subsequent repeal of the applicable regulations, which signified that the Tax Department had committed itself to withholding active enforcement on a long-term basis, does not render the proceeding moot. Petitioners' pleading placed in issue &quot;[r]espondents' system-wide failure to perform their statutory ... dut[y] ... to enforce Article[s] 20 ... and ... 12-A of the New York Tax Law&quot;, as well as their failure to enforce the implementing regulations. The former aspect of the controversy survives the repeal of the regulations and takes on additional urgency in light of the tax agency's determination to abandon altogether its former enforcement mechanisms.  Nonetheless, the recent administrative action so alters the landscape in which the controversy is presented that it would be unwise and unsound for the Court of Appeals to resolve it on the basis of the arguments before the Court.  Accordingly, the matter is remitted to Supreme Court so that the parties can consider the need, if any, for further submissions and the court can reconsider the dispute in light of the Tax Department's newly minted long-term policy of abstaining from taking active measures to enforce the legislatively mandated excise and sales taxes on motor fuel and cigarettes destined for sale on Indian reservations. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The asphalt company submitted a substantially higher over-all bid for a street repair project compared to those submitted by other bidders.

The city awarded each contract to the lowest aggregate bidder. The asphalt company commenced an action challenging the city's selection. The lower court denied preliminary injunction relief and granted motions to dismiss, holding that the utility interference work in each contract was not &quot;public work&quot; within the meaning of N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 103(1), but that the mayor enjoyed a &quot;bypass&quot; authority, pursuant to New York City Charter &sect; 313(b)(2). The appellate court affirmed the judgment, finding that the &quot;total character of the arrangement&quot; convinced it that the utility interference work did constitute &quot;public work.&quot; On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court judgment, concluding that the legislature had not authorized the city to alter the contours of &quot;public work&quot; matters, and that bypass authority under &sect; 313(b)(2) was not continued under &sect; 103(1).</SPAN></P>

To override the plain language of the General Municipal Law, an express or definitive declaration would be required to establish that the Legislature intended to continue and transfer bypass authority of such sweeping proportions and nature solely to the chief municipal executive or designee.  Even assuming Charter &sect; 313 constitutes a mere revision or recodification, a determination that such enactments fit within the General Municipal Law exception would also demand some express action or more reasonably definitive direction by the Legislature, which is lacking here.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioners, as citizen-taxpayers, have standing to challenge the Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act of 1996, which authorized the creation of a State general obligation debt of $ 1,750,000,000 to be used &quot;for the single purpose of preserving, enhancing, restoring, and improving the quality of the state's environment&quot; (L 1996, ch 412, &sect; 2), as violative of the &quot;single work or purpose&quot; requirement set forth in article VII, &sect; 11 of the State Constitution.  As a general principle, citizen-taxpayer status does not confer standing to challenge the issuance of State bond acts.  However, there are limited instances, such as here, when a voter may challenge a bond issue on the basis that it infringes upon explicit voter protections provided by article VII, &sect; 11 of the State Constitution, which sets forth the prerequisite of a public referendum for all proposed long-term public debt, and mandates that proposed public financing schemes must be &quot;for some single work or purpose, to be distinctly specified therein.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The &quot;single work or purpose&quot; clause empowers the State to contract a debt for some single objective that may relate to more than one physical structure or, as in the case of relief bonds, may not include a physical structure, while precluding the Legislative and Executive branches from proposing bond issues aimed at &quot;purposes&quot; that are so imprecise as to be essentially generic, thereby allowing funding of a host of projects having no discernible common theme.  The Bond Act at issue authorizes the creation of State indebtedness for projects in a number of subcategories, all of which are directly related to the single categorical purpose of improving the State's environment.  Each of the subcategories--safe drinking water, improvement of solid waste facilities, remediation of contaminated properties, enhancement of air and water quality, and preservation of open spaces, parks and historic sites--is naturally and logically related to the stated unitary goal of &quot;preserving, enhancing, restoring, and improving&quot; the environment (L 1996, ch 412, &sect; 2).  Thus, the &quot;single work or purpose&quot; requirement is satisfied.  Moreover, there is nothing dissonant about including projects related to the preservation of open spaces, parks and historic sites in a Bond Act aimed at conserving and improving the environment.  </SPAN></P>

That the particular projects for which the proceeds were to be appropriated are listed in a separate legislative enactment is of no legal consequence in this context because the Constitution requires only that the Bond Act &quot;distinctly specif[y]&quot; the &quot;single work or purpose&quot; of the bond issue; it does not require a listing of the myriad activities to be undertaken in the service of that work or purpose.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayers owned and maintained an apartment in New York City. The state department of taxation concluded that taxpayers were statutory residents of New York and issued a notice of deficiencies. Taxpayers petitioned for a redetermination of the deficiency. The Tax Appeals Tribunal confirmed the deficiency. Taxpayers contended that the New York State resident income tax, N.Y. Tax Law art. 22, violated the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, as applied to statutory residents of the State who claimed another State as their domicile. Taxpayers argued that, because New York gave no credit for resident income taxes paid to other States on investment income from intangible personal property, it potentially subjected them to double taxation. The court held that the statute did not substantially affect interstate commerce and, therefore, the protections of the dormant Commerce Clause were not applicable. The court also determined that, even assuming arguendo that the Commerce Clause was implicated, the tax was constitutional because the tax did not facially discriminate against interstate commerce, and States had traditionally retained broad powers to tax their own residents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioners, New Jersey domiciliaries and statutory New York residents (Tax Law &sect; 605 [b] [1] [B]) for income tax purposes, whose entire income was determined to be subject to State income tax under section 605, have not shown any demonstrable impact on an identifiable interstate market which would warrant the conclusion that the tax substantially affects interstate commerce so as to implicate the dormant Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8).  The New York income tax is based upon a taxpayer's resident status, without regard to any specific commercial or economic transaction or activity.  While petitioner husband is engaged in interstate commerce in that he commutes daily from New Jersey, works as an investment banker in New York, and is involved in numerous economic activities while in New York, the income tax is imposed without regard to his commute, or the specific nature of his activities in this State.  It is imposed solely based upon his presence and maintenance of a permanent place of abode in New York, without regard to any economic activities incidental to his presence here.  </SPAN></P>

Even if the New York State income tax on the entire income of a statutory resident of the State (Tax Law &sect; 605 [b] [1] [B]) who is a domiciliary of another State implicates the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8), the tax does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause because the tax does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce, and States have traditionally retained broad powers to tax their own residents. The first step in analyzing any law subject to judicial scrutiny under the dormant Commerce Clause is to identify the interstate market that is being subjected to discriminatory or unduly burdensome taxation. In the absence of actual or prospective competition between the supposedly favored and disfavored entities in a single market there can be no local preference, whether by express discrimination against interstate commerce or undue burden upon it, to which the dormant Commerce Clause may apply.  Here, because the tax at issue does not operate to the disadvantage of any identifiable interstate market, but rather simply taxes residents based on their status as residents, it does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.  The fact that it may have &quot;incidental effects&quot; on interstate commerce because petitioner commutes to work in New York, thus implicating the interstate labor market, is not sufficient to prove a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the order of the lower court and held that the regulatory time under &sect; 809 did not begin to run until the application was complete.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. For the purpose of judicial review pursuant to CPLR article 78, a determination will be deemed final if it stands as the agency's last word on a discrete legal issue that arises during an administrative proceeding, and the injury purportedly inflicted by the agency may not be prevented or significantly ameliorated by further administrative action or by steps available to the complaining party. If further agency proceedings might render the disputed issue moot or academic, then the agency position cannot be considered &quot;definitive&quot; or the injury &quot;actual&quot; or &quot;concrete.&quot; Accordingly, an application by appellant County for review of a request to modify a landfill operating permit, which initially was submitted to the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and then forwarded to the Adirondack Park Agency (APA) by DEC pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding, became &quot;final&quot; so as to trigger the 60-day Statute of Limitations under Executive Law &sect; 818 (1) when the APA unequivocally advised appellant by letter that it was required to file a new application, consisting of a new signature page to be annexed to the copy of the DEC application and responses to interrogatories, and the &quot;regulatory time clock&quot; had not yet begun to run with regard to their proposal.  The letter set forth the APA's definitive position and signaled the completion of agency activity.  It also inflicted an actual, concrete injury on appellant.  By refusing to treat the DEC application as an APA submission under the Memorandum of Understanding, the APA reset the regulatory time clock that had begun to run when the DEC previously deemed the application complete, effectively nullifying any benefits that appellant had already received by operation of Executive Law &sect; 809's automatic review provisions.  It is inconsequential that the APA had not yet reached a formal conclusion regarding the proposed modifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Challenge to Agency's Jurisdiction </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A challenge to an agency's assertion of jurisdiction over a matter should be reviewed by a court only after a final determination--which might effectively render the dispute academic--is reached by the agency.  Although the assertion of jurisdiction may constitute a definitive agency determination, an agency's erroneous assertion of jurisdiction may ultimately never cause any real injury, which is required for the finding of finality that is necessary to trigger the applicable Statute of Limitations.  To allow immediate CPLR article 78 review of such jurisdictional challenges, therefore, would unnecessarily interfere with the agency process and waste judicial resources.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, adult entertainment company and patrons, appealed the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department, which granted a motion by defendants, city and business improvement district, for summary judgment, dismissing the actions and declaring that the amendments to the Zoning Resolution of New York did not violate plaintiffs' rights of freedom of expression and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, adult entertainment companies and patrons, brought an action against defendants, city and business improvement district, alleging that the amendments to the Zoning Resolution of New York, which included an array of site limitations and anti-clustering provisions governing adult entertainment, deprived them of their right to free expression protected by N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and U.S. Const. amend. I. Plaintiffs appealed the decision of the lower court, which granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the decision of the lower court because the amendments were aimed at the negative secondary effects caused by adult uses, which was a legitimate governmental purpose. The court determined that defendants conducted studies of their own and the nonempirical evidence was extensive and indicative of a clear relationship between adult uses and urban decay.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Zoning Amendment Geographically Restricting Adult Entertainment Establishments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. New York City's Amended Zoning Resolution, which bars adult entertainment establishments from certain districts that are zoned for manufacturing and commercial use but also permit residential development, and permits the regulated uses in all other manufacturing districts and in all high-density, general commercial districts (Amended Zoning Resolution &sect; 32-01 [a]; &sect; 42-01 [a]), is not purposefully directed at controlling the content of the message conveyed through adult businesses and, therefore, does not implicate speech or conduct that is protected by the First Amendment and by NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 8.  The Federal constitutional analysis requires examination of the ordinance's &quot;predominant purpose&quot;, while the State constitutional inquiry focuses on whether there has been &quot;a purposeful attempt to regulate speech&quot;.  In the context of these facts, however, the difference in verbiage does not significantly affect the outcome, since it is apparent from the amendments' legislative history that ameliorating the negative social consequences of proliferating adult uses was the City's only goal.  Before enacting the Resolution, the City Council assembled an extensive legislative record connecting adult establishments and negative secondary effects, including numerous studies on the effects of adult establishments both within and without New York City.  In view of the legislative record upon which the City Council rested its decision to regulate adult uses, enactment of the Amended Zoning Resolution was not an impermissible attempt to regulate the content of expression but rather was aimed at the negative secondary effects caused by adult uses, a legitimate governmental purpose.  Moreover, it is not significant that definitions of adult uses in the Amended Zoning Resolution are based in part on the content of the entertainment offered rather than exclusively on the age of the businesses' clientele, because the test is not whether the regulated establishments are defined without reference to content but whether the ordinance's goal is unrelated to suppressing that content, and that test is plainly met here.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Freedom of Speech - Zoning Amendment Geographically Restricting Adult Entertainment Establishments - Less Restrictive Alternatives </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. New York City's Amended Zoning Resolution, which bars adult entertainment establishments from certain districts that are zoned for manufacturing and commercial use but also permit residential development, and permits the regulated uses in all other manufacturing districts and in all high-density, general commercial districts (Amended Zoning Resolution &sect; 32-01 [a]; &sect; 42-01 [a]), does not violate the free speech provision of NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 8 on the ground that less restrictive methods of addressing the problems caused by adult uses, such as more aggressive enforcement of existing penal and public nuisance laws, developing targeted signage requirements and limiting adult-use zoning restrictions to new establishments, should have been pursued.  The amendments represent a coherent regulatory scheme designed to attack the problems associated with adult establishments. By preventing adult businesses from locating in potential residential districts while allowing such establishments to locate in manufacturing and commercial districts, the amendments protect only those communities and community institutions that are most vulnerable to their adverse impacts.  The City Council reasonably determined that the listed alternatives would not adequately address problems it sought to ameliorate.  </SPAN></P>

While the amendments' enforcement will lead to the forced relocation of some 84% of the City's 177 adult businesses, the City's supported allegations that the space available for adult uses constitutes over 11% of the City's total land area and about 4% when reduced by land encumbered by properties that are unlikely to be developed for commercial use, that the amended zoning code leaves at least 500 potential sites for adult establishments to relocate and operate and will allow adult businesses to remain in districts that permit a wide mix of commercial, retail, entertainment and manufacturing uses, and that all of the areas in Manhattan zoned for adult use and at least 80% of the land area in the other boroughs are within a 10-minute walk from a subway line or a major bus route, satisfy the City's initial burden of showing that the space designated for adult uses is adequate to accommodate the 177 existing adult businesses.  An affidavit by a land-use planning and local government consultant, who actually visited the sites the City identified as potential receptors, which concluded that the City's zoning plan does not allow for adequate alternative avenues for adult expression is not sufficient to raise a triable question of fact as to the availability of enough potential receptor sites in view of the affiant's reliance on several assumptions that are inconsistent with controlling legal principles and the absence of any attempt by the affiant to quantify his observations or to make concrete allegations as to precisely how many of the 500 potential receptor sites identified by defendants were, in his estimate, unavailable. </SPAN></P>

Under the statutory provisions for hardship extensions, a nonconforming adult establishment may apply to the Board of Standards and Appeals for permission to continue to operate beyond the one-year amortization period set forth in the statute where it can show that it has made substantial expenditures related to the nonconformity, that such expenditures cannot be recouped within a year and that the requested extension is the minimum necessary to permit such recoupment (Zoning Resolution &sect; 72-40).  Having failed to seek relief under this provision, plaintiffs are not now in a position to complain that their constitutional due process rights have been violated.  </SPAN></P>

The amendments' definitional provisions are sufficiently specific to provide the public with clear and reasonable notice of the type of businesses that are covered.  Moreover, the ordinance's distance requirements are not too vague because they do not include a statement indicating the precise standard for measurement.  To the extent that this aspect of the ordinance's provisions leaves room for confusion, the problem is procedurally remediable through administrative application and rule making.  There is no indication on the present record that the City's enforcement of the distance rules will be arbitrary or uneven.  </SPAN></P>

The district attorney, county voters, and taxpayers challenged the executive order.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In two CPLR article 78 proceedings for mandamus, prohibition, declaratory judgment and injunctive relief with respect to the implementation of Executive Order No. 27 (9 NYCRR 5.27), which required the Attorney-General to replace the Bronx County District Attorney in all investigations and proceedings arising out of the shooting of a certain police officer, an appeal from an order of the Appellate Division affirming an order and judgment of the Supreme Court dismissing the petitions has not been mooted by the death of one defendant, the conviction of the two other defendants on Federal charges, and the dismissal of the State indictments against those two defendants.  An appeal presents a live controversy where the rights of the parties will be directly affected by the determination and where the judgment has immediate consequence for them.  Here, a live controversy remains because Executive Order No. 27 mandates that Bronx County pay all charges incurred by the Attorney-General in prosecuting the matter, and the validity of the charges depends on the validity of the order.  Further, the District Attorney may find it necessary to initiate additional proceedings or inquiries if the Executive Order is invalidated.  </SPAN></P>

Executive Order No. 27 (9 NYCRR 5.27), which required the Attorney-General to replace the Bronx County District Attorney in all investigations and proceedings arising out of the shooting of a certain police officer, is not invalid on the ground that the District Attorney, a constitutional officer accountable to the local electorate, is insulated from nonconsensual superseder by a &quot;zone of independence&quot; based on a delegation to him of exclusive authority to prosecute crimes in Bronx County (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art XIII, &sect; 13; County Law &sect; 700 [1]).  The Constitution provides for the offices of Governor, Attorney-General and District Attorneys, but it does not identify particular--let alone exclusive--prosecutorial duties or allocate the responsibility among them.  While prosecutorial authority over the decades has in fact passed from the Attorney-General to the District Attorneys, the Legislature has recognized for more than 150 years the authority of the Attorney-General to prosecute crimes, even at the local level, when properly directed to do so by the Governor. Nor has such authority been restricted to instances where a local conflict of interest disabled a District Attorney, an officer within the executive branch, from prosecuting a matter.  No such limitation appears in the Constitution or statutes.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Executive Order No. 27 (9 NYCRR 5.27), which required the Attorney-General to replace the Bronx County District Attorney in all investigations and proceedings arising out of the shooting of a certain police officer, is not invalid on the ground that Executive Law &sect; 63-d, passed in connection with the recent death penalty legislation (L 1995, ch 1), implicitly repealed the portion of Executive Law &sect; 63 (2) pertaining to first-degree murder prosecutions.  Section 63-d permits the Governor to direct the Attorney-General, when requested by the District Attorney, to assist in a potential death penalty case. Nothing in or about that section evinces a legislative intention to limit a Governor's supersession authority.  These statutes simply provide two different, but complementary, avenues by which the Attorney-General can exercise the limited prosecutorial authority of that State office.  There is no repugnancy indicating implicit repealer.  </SPAN></P>

Executive Order No. 27 does not promulgate any rules requiring District Attorneys to seek the death penalty and directs only supersession, as contemplated by Executive Law &sect; 63 (2).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Executive Order No. 27 (9 NYCRR 5.27), which required the Attorney-General to replace the Bronx County District Attorney in all investigations and proceedings arising out of the shooting of a certain police officer, does not constitute an abuse of the Governor's authority on the ground that the Governor chose to supersede the District Attorney merely because he disagreed with the District Attorney's discretionary decision about sentencing. Although a Governor is not obliged to state reasons for superseder, Executive Order No. 27 does in fact detail the Governor's reasons for superseding the District Attorney in this instance, and they go beyond disagreement with a discretionary decision in a particular matter. The challenged Executive Order expresses the Governor's executive judgment that there was a threat to faithful execution of the death penalty law that supported this particular superseder. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent commissioner issued a written determination after it found that sufficient evidence supported an allegation of patient abuse by petitioner nurse aide. The determination was entered into a registry and the nurse aide was terminated pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 415.4. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) annulled the decision and the commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner claimed that the appellate court erred in annulling the discharge on the ground that it resulted from an improper retroactive application of N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 415.4 to conduct that allegedly occurred prior to the adoption of the provision. The court held that the regulation was not retroactively applied because, by its terms, it regulated future employment by barring residential care facilities from employing any nurse aide who had previously been found guilty of patient abuse. The regulation did not vary the existing definition of patient abuse, or alter the substantive law governing the nurse aide's conduct. The regulation did not change the procedural scheme by which she could seek redress. However, the substantial evidence standard of proof used in the determination was constitutionally insufficient to protect against an erroneous deprivation of the nurse aide's tangible liberty interest in pursuing employment in her chosen field. Accordingly, the nurse aide was entitled to a new determination of whether the allegation of patient abuse was substantiated by a fair preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified and was remitted to the commissioner for a new determination on the existing record using the constitutionally required preponderance of the evidence standard of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health - Nursing Homes - Patient Neglect 10 NYCRR 415.4 (eff Apr. 1, 1992), which specifically prohibits nursing homes from employing nurse aides &quot;who have ... had a finding entered into the New York State Nurse Aide Registry concerning abuse, neglect or mistreatment of residents or misappropriation of their property&quot; (10 NYCRR 415.4 [b] [1] [ii] [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">b</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">]), was not improperly applied retroactively to petitioner nurse aide based upon an incident of patient abuse that antedated promulgation of the regulation. A statute is not retroactive when made to apply to future transactions merely because such transactions relate to and are founded upon antecedent events.  By its terms, the provision here aims to regulate employment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">in futuro</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by barring residential care facilities from employing any nurse aide who, previously, has been found guilty of patient abuse.  Moreover, respondents' promulgation of 10 NYCRR 415.4 in no way varied the existing definition of patient abuse (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;10 NYCRR 81.1 [a]), altered the substantive law governing petitioner's conduct or changed the procedural scheme by which petitioner could seek redress.  In effect at the time of petitioner's alleged conduct were statutory provisions which required the reporting of patient abuse (Public Health Law &sect; 2803-d [1]--[4]); provided for an opportunity to challenge the State Health Commissioner's findings, seek expungement, and request a fair hearing (Public Health Law &sect; 2803-d [6] [b], [d]); mandated the listing of sustained findings of abuse in the Nurse Aide Registry (Public Health Law &sect; 2803-d [6] [g]); and authorized the imposition of additional penalties (Public Health Law &sect; 2803-d [7]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Protected Liberty Interest - Entry of Name in New York State Nurse Aide Registry Entry of a finding of patient abuse against petitioner nurse aide in the New York State Nurse Aide Registry (10 NYCRR 415.4 [b] [1] [ii] [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">b</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">]), with its resultant discharge from nursing home employment and public disclosure of the finding, implicates a constitutionally protected liberty interest. The inclusion and dissemination of information contained in a register of those suspected of abuse or maltreatment which harms not only an individual's good name, integrity or standing in the community, but also affects that individual's present employment or effectively forecloses possible future employment opportunities is sufficient to constitute &quot;stigma plus&quot; and invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause.  Placement of a finding against petitioner of patient abuse in the Nurse Aide Registry clearly calls into question her reputation, honor or integrity.  Moreover, once a finding has been entered in the Registry, that information is then made accessible to health care providers and future employers (10 NYCRR 415.4), and also to the public-at-large without restriction (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;42 USC &sect; 1396r [e] [2] [B]).  Thus, by publicly branding petitioner a patient abuser, the State's action affects not only her occasion for employment in the residential health care industry, but also may well extend to prevent future employment opportunities in any arena, thereby placing a tangible burden on her employment prospects.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Protected Liberty Interest - Adequacy of Substantial Evidence Standard for Entry of Name in New York State Nurse Aide Registry Use of the substantial evidence standard of proof contained in State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 306 to substantiate a report of patient abuse against petitioner, a nurse aide, prior to forwarding her name to the New York State Nurse Aide Registry (10 NYCRR 415.4 [b] [1] [ii] [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">b</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">]), with its resultant discharge from nursing home employment and public disclosure of the finding, is constitutionally insufficient to prevent a deprivation of petitioner's liberty interest. Evaluation of the constitutional sufficiency of administrative procedures involves the balancing of three factors: the nature of the private interest affected by the State's action; the risk of an erroneous deprivation and the effect of additional procedural safeguards; and the governmental interest.  Petitioner has a legitimate interest in pursuing employment in her chosen field, and the stigma of being labeled a patient abuser may well jeopardize her future employment prospects.  It is beyond dispute that New York State also has a significant interest in protecting elderly, infirm or disabled persons from the infliction of physical harm by those entrusted with their care.  Substantial evidence is less than a preponderance of the evidence and, as a burden of proof, it demands only that a given inference is reasonable and plausible, not necessarily the most probable.  Under the substantial evidence standard, the inclusion of a nurse aide on the Registry can be supported by nothing more than the hearsay evidence giving rise to the State Health Commissioner's initial investigation.  Where, as here, mandatory inclusion on the Registry labels a nurse aide as a patient abuser, and indisputably adversely impacts on future employment opportunities, any procedural safeguard of proof by less than a preponderance of the evidence is constitutionally inadequate to protect against an erroneous deprivation of a tangible liberty interest. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured parties had brought suit against appellee keyboard manufacturers for repetitive stress injuries. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) found that the accrual rule for toxic tort cases was controlling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the injured parties' contention that the continuing duty to warn doctrine could have been applied to extend the statute of limitations period. The court determined that RSI could not have developed until years after a person first used a keyboard, or not until after one keyboard was discarded and a person subsequently used different keyboards. The court concluded that the proper rule in RSI cases was that the cause of action accrued against a given manufacturer upon the onset of symptoms or the last use of the injury-producing device, whichever was earlier. The court rejected the injured parties' contention that accrual should have been measured not from the time they experienced RSI symptoms, but from the date they actually became aware of the nature of their injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order and remitted the cases for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion, and answered the certified question in the negative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - Three-Year Statute of Limitations - Repetitive Stress Injuries A cause of action against a keyboard manufacturer for repetitive stress injury suffered by a keyboard user accrues upon the onset of symptoms, or the last use of the keyboard, whichever is earlier.  Such a rule strikes a proper balance between giving a plaintiff an opportunity to commence an action after becoming aware of a symptom of injury and providing certainty and predictability to manufacturers, employers and other economic actors in their risk assessment, while also avoiding stale claims.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - What Statute Governs - Repetitive Stress Injuries CPLR 214-c, which provides that &quot;the three year period within which an action to recover damages for personal injury or injury to property caused by the latent effects of exposure to any substance or combination of substances ... must be commenced shall be computed from the date of discovery of the injury by the plaintiff or from the date when through the exercise of reasonable diligence such injury should have been discovered by the plaintiff, whichever is earlier&quot; (CPLR 214-c [2]), is inapplicable to plaintiffs' causes of action against defendant keyboard manufacturers for repetitive stress injury arising from the use of keyboards. While CPLR 214-c does nominally cover situations where a plaintiff is injured due to &quot;contact&quot; with a &quot;substance,&quot; it is plain from reading the statute as a whole that the types of substances intended to be covered are toxic substances. Inasmuch as a keyboard is not a toxic substance, CPLR 214-c is inapplicable to plaintiffs' claims.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limitation of Actions - When Cause of Action Accrues - Continuing Duty to Warn In actions against defendant keyboard manufacturers for repetitive stress injury suffered by plaintiff keyboard users, the continuing duty to warn doctrine may not be applied to extend the limitations period. The gravamen of plaintiffs' claims is that defendants' keyboards were defectively designed.  The bar of the Statute of Limitations cannot be avoided through an allegation that defendant had a continuing duty to warn plaintiff of the possible damaging consequences resulting from the act alleged to be negligent.  As a rule, the date of injury is the benchmark for determining the accrual of a cause of action, and the mere continuation of the duty to warn into the limitations period is not enough to resurrect a cause of action premised upon an injury occurring earlier.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered that the law was a constitutional delegation. The lower appellate court affirmed, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed the lower courts' rulings.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Statute Authorizing Governor to Regulate Inmate's Participation in Temporary Work Release Program Correction Law &sect; 851 (2) (as amended by L 1995, ch 3, &sect; 29), which provides that &quot;[t]he governor, by executive order, may exclude or limit the participation of any class of otherwise eligible inmates from participation in a temporary release program&quot;, does not unconstitutionally delegate the fundamental law-making power of the Legislature to the Governor in violation of the separation of powers doctrine on the ground that it delegates directly to the Governor, who lacks expertise in the field of corrections, the power to make the policy choices of adding additional classes of inmates to those statutorily ineligible for participation in one or more temporary release programs.  Executive or administrative rulemaking may entail some policy selectivity without offending the separation of powers doctrine, so long as the basic policy choices have been made and articulated by the Legislature.  Here, the Legislature set over-all policy regarding temporary release programs.  It expressly declared that further regulatory implementation of temporary release programs may be necessary and that the Commissioner of Correctional Services, in reviewing existing regulations and promulgating new ones, was to be &quot;guided by consideration for the safety of the community and the welfare of the inmate&quot; (Correction Law &sect; 852 [1]).  It is of no moment that the foregoing articulation of general policy regarding temporary release programs was directed toward the Governor's appointed Commissioner of Correctional Services and not reiterated when the Governor was given similar rulemaking authority in Laws of 1995 (ch 3, &sect; 29).  Nor is it significant for separation of powers analysis that the legislative delegation of rulemaking authority went directly to the Governor rather than to the Commissioner of Correctional Services or some other experienced administrator. The Legislature is free not only to delegate rulemaking powers to a specialized administrative body appointed by the Governor, but to substitute the Governor for that body.  </SPAN></P>

The statute's explicit direction that additional regulation of inmate participation in temporary release programs is to be &quot;guided by consideration for the safety of the community and the welfare of the inmate&quot; (Correction Law &sect; 852 [1]) is an adequate standard for executive action or rulemaking. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city objected to the siting of a new residential facility for the developmentally disabled proposed under N. Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 41.34. Petitioner, the commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health (commissioner), conducted a hearing and approved the facility. The city sought review and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) annulled the commissioner's determination. The commissioner sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the new facility would result in an over concentration of such facilities in the area and that the commissioner arbitrarily excluded several facilities from consideration by limiting his analysis to the neighborhood rather than the area. Pursuant to N.Y. Mental Hyg. Law &sect; 41.34 (c)(5), the court held that the only ground to sustain an objection to a proposed facility was if the commissioner determined that the nature and character of the area in which the facility was to be based would be substantially altered. The court found that the larger area urged by the city had no relation to physical or subjective neighborhood limits and that the commissioner's delineation of the area was entitled to deference as rational and supported by the evidence. The court found that that the city's concerns were actually related to an alcohol treatment center and another nonlicensed facility in the area. The court held that the commissioner's exclusion of these facilities from his examination was not arbitrary and the presence of these other facilities could not support the denial of a new facility when the need for such a new facility was clearly demonstrated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Community Residence -- Site Selection -- Standard of Judicial Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The standard of judicial review of the decision of the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health as to whether the nature and character of the area in which a proposed community residential facility is to be based would be substantially altered as a result of the establishment of the facility (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 41.34 [c] [5]) is whether the decision is arbitrary and capricious and whether it is supported by substantial evidence. While factual findings made pursuant to a hearing required by law must be affirmed when supported by substantial evidence in the record, an arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies for challenges to an agency's interpretation or application of a statute or regulation.  However, when construction of a statute depends on an understanding of underlying operational practices or entails an evaluation of factual data and inferences to be drawn therefrom, the question of statutory interpretation is generally left to the special expertise of the agency and the determination is entitled to deference when it is not irrational or unreasonable.  Rationality is the underlying basis for both the arbitrary and capricious standard and the substantial evidence rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Community Residence -- Site Selection -- Ground for Sustaining Objection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In reviewing an objection to a proposed community residential facility for the mentally disabled, the Commissioner of the department responsible for licensing the proposed facility must consider the need for the facility and the concentration of similar facilities already established in the area, but the only ground provided in the statute to justify sustaining the objection is if the Commissioner determines that the nature and character of the area in which the facility is to be based would be substantially altered as a result of the establishment of the facility (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 41.34 [c] [5]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Community Residence -- Site Selection -- Determination of Area to be Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In reviewing an objection to a proposed community residential facility for the mentally disabled (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 41.34 [c] [5]), the reliance of the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health upon boundaries created by parks and main thoroughfares which residents were not likely to cross on foot in delineating the area to be affected by the establishment of the proposed residence is rational and supported by the evidence adduced at the hearing.  The Commissioner's determination rationally adopts the boundaries of the neighborhood as defined by the City's own witnesses.  It was the neighbors closest to the proposed site of the residence who testified about the boundaries of their neighborhood and it is in that neighborhood where the proposed facility would be located.  Such evidence is of paramount importance under the State policy, which is geared towards incorporating the mentally disabled into the life of the community which is expected to provide them with sustenance.  Accordingly, the Commissioner may properly focus on the potential impact upon direct &quot;neighbors&quot;.  If the proposed facility would not &quot;substantially alter&quot; its immediate neighborhood, it is difficult to find fault with the conclusion that adjacent areas would be little affected.  Thus, the Commissioner's decision to examine the potential impact of the proposed facility upon its immediately surrounding community is entitled to deference as rational and supported by the record.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Community Residence -- Site Selection -- Over Concentration of Facilities in Residential Area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In reviewing an objection to a proposed community residential facility for the mentally disabled (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 41.34 [c] [5]), it was reasonable for the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health to require proof of more than a mere recitation of the number of other facilities located in the same area to sustain the City's objection.  While one of the goals of the statute is to avoid over concentration of such facilities in any one area, the mere number of &quot;special needs&quot; facilities within an area is not dispositive. Here, the evidence strongly supports the conceded need for the proposed residence and the City suggested no alternative site. The mere presence of other facilities already situated in a particular area cannot be the sole basis for denying the establishment of a similar new facility when such need for that facility is demonstrated.  This is precisely the balance reached by the statute in which concentration is relevant but secondary to a determination that the nature and character of an area will be &quot;substantially altered.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mental Health -- Community Residence -- Site Selection -- Over Concentration of Facilities in Residential Area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In reviewing an objection to a proposed community residential facility for the mentally disabled (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 41.34 [c] [5]), the decision of the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health to limit his examination to certain facilities in determining whether the addition of the proposed facility would result in an over concentration of similar facilities in the same area was not arbitrary.  Under section 41.34 of the Mental Hygiene Law, only facilities which are licensed by a State agency or which house former patients of the Office of Mental Health or the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities must be considered.  Here, many of the concerns of the residents may be traced to an Alcoholism Receiving Center and the nonlicensed residence for a group of adults recovering from addictions. The proposed residence at issue, however, is for individuals who suffer from mental disabilities, not addiction. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant third-party defendant building owner and tenants challenged the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which denied their motion to convert cross-claims to third-party claims against respondent injured firefighters, denied the building owner's motion to amend to include claims for indemnification and contribution, and granted respondent contractors' motion to dismiss the claims against them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One firefighter was killed and another was injured when the canopy roof on the building addition and a portion of the addition's masonry wall collapsed outward during a fire. The firefighters filed an action against the building owner, the tenants, and the contractors that designed and built the addition for violations of state and local building code provisions. The tenants asserted cross claims for indemnification and contribution against the contractors, and the building owner counterclaimed against all the contractors except for one. The contractors argued that they were exonerated from liability to the firefighters based on N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 205-a. The court disagreed, reversed the judgment, and denied the contractors' cross motions. The court held that the limitations of the statutory cause of action available to the firefighters did not affect the right of parties held liable to seek contribution and indemnification from those whose carelessness was, in whole or in part, the cause of the harm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negligence - Injuries to Firefighters - Availability of Indemnification or Contribution to Person Liable under General Municipal Law Former &sect; 205-a A person properly held liable to an injured firefighter under former section 205-a of the General Municipal Law may seek indemnification or contribution from parties who were not in possession or control of the premises but who were allegedly responsible, in whole or in part, for the accident, even though the injured firefighter would not have a direct cause of action against the third-party defendant.  A defendant may seek contribution from a third party even if the injured plaintiff has no direct right of recovery against that party, either because of a procedural bar or because of a substantive legal rule.  A contribution claim can be made even when the contributor has no duty to the injured plaintiff, provided there has been a breach of a duty that runs from the contributor to the defendant who has been held liable.  The &quot;critical requirement&quot; for apportionment by contribution under CPLR article 14 is that the breach of duty by the contributing party must have had a part in causing or augmenting the injury for which contribution is sought.  Similarly, the key element of a common-law cause of action for indemnification is not a duty running from the indemnitor to the injured party, but rather is a separate duty owed the indemnitee by the indemnitor. The limitations of the statutory cause of action available to injured firefighters do not affect the right of parties held liable pursuant to that cause of action to seek contribution and/or indemnification from those whose carelessness was, in whole or in part, the cause of the harm.  The primary purpose of General Municipal Law &sect; 205-a is to ameliorate the harsh effects of the common-law firefighters rule, which precluded firefighters from recovering in tort for injuries sustained during the performance of their firefighting duties. Once the firefighter is afforded an opportunity to recover damages from a party in a position to oversee the safety of the premises--the owner or other person in control--the statutory goal is satisfied and there is no reason to prevent the party who is forced to answer in damages from shifting the economic burden to those whose negligent acts or omissions actually caused the harm.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer challenged the city's ordinance, which imposed a special tax on &quot;transient&quot; retailers who operated at temporary business sites. The taxpayer claimed that the tax discriminated in favor of local retail businesses and therefore violated the Commerce Clause. The trial court dismissed the cause of action and the appellate court affirmed, finding no Commerce Clause violation. On appeal, the court recognized that the tax burden on &quot;transient&quot; retailers was not imposed on retailers who operated from fixed locations within the city. Consequently, the tax conferred an economic advantage on a particular class of local businesses, i.e., those that ply their wares from fixed locations. Since, by definition, the class of favored business included only locals, the ordinance was not considered &quot;even-handed&quot; and was per se invalid as a violation of the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - Validity of Municipal Ordinance That Taxes Transient Retailers A municipal ordinance which imposes a special tax on transient retailers who operate at temporary business sites, but not retailers who operate from fixed locations within the municipality (Albany City Code &sect;&sect; 7-240--7-243), discriminates in favor of local retail businesses and therefore violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]).  A regulation or tax that discriminates in favor of local economic interests is invalid unless it is narrowly tailored to accomplish a compelling local purpose or, in the case of a tax, can meet the stringent standards of the &quot;compensatory tax&quot; doctrine.  Local statutes that facially discriminate against interstate trade are subject to a virtually per se rule of invalidity.  Moreover, the discriminatory character of such a law is not altered because its burden may also fall upon some local businesses.  Here, the tax imposed by the ordinance confers an economic advantage on a particular class of local businesses, i.e., those that ply their wares from fixed locations.  Since, by definition, the class of favored business includes only locals, the ordinance cannot be considered &quot;even-handed&quot; and is, thus, per se invalid. Nor can the transient-retailer tax be rationalized as a compensatory tax that is designed to approximate the tax burden that falls on fixed-location retailers whose property tax bill subsidizes the local services on which all merchants and citizens rely.  There is no relationship at all between the &quot;taxable event&quot; that triggers the obligation to pay real property taxes, i.e., the ownership of property, and the &quot;taxable event&quot; that triggers the obligation to pay the transient-retailer tax, i.e., the sale of goods from a temporary location.  Nor is there any necessary correlation between the amount to be paid for real estate taxes, which are measured by the assessed value of the parcel and improvements, and the amount to be paid under the transient-retailer tax, which is calculated by reference to the merchant's gross receipts. Further, although some fixed-location merchants support local services through their direct payment of real estate taxes, there are a substantial number of such merchants whose retail sites are leased and who therefore are not directly responsible for property taxes.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 240.20(3) offended constitutional safeguards implicating free speech, vagueness, and overbreadth under both state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed and found that the disorderly conduct statute did not circumscribe pure speech directed at an individual but was directed at words and utterances coupled with an intent to create a risk of public disorder, which the state had the authority and responsibility to prohibit, prevent, and punish. The statute was not overbroad on its face or in its particular application because it provided sufficient notice of what conduct was prohibited and was not written in such a manner as to permit or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforce.

Rather, it is directed at words and utterances coupled with an intent to create a risk of public disorder, which the State has the authority and responsibility to prohibit, prevent and punish.

The statute provides sufficient notice of what conduct is prohibited and is not written in such a manner as to permit or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.  The statutory requirement that the defendant possess an intent to cause, or recklessly create a risk of, public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, narrows the definition, so that no inadvertent act may be punished.  Further, the objective standard of public disturbance and the narrowing effect of the fact that all of the other acts proscribed by the section are publicly offensive, permit, if they do not require the conclusion that the statute is sufficiently definite.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disorderly Conduct -- Sufficiency of Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction under Penal Law &sect; 240.20 (3), which provides that a &quot;person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof . . . [i]n a public place, he uses abusive or obscene language, or makes an obscene gesture&quot;, arising out of an incident that occurred when defendant uttered obscenities at and shoved a police officer in front of a bar and then reentered the bar when the officer attempted to arrest him.  Although the arresting officer testified that he did not initially observe any other persons outside the bar, he also indicated that because of the way he was turned facing the defendant, he was unable to see whether any of the patrons inside the bar or the doorway of the bar observed the opening provocative salvos.  The officer further testified that immediately following the first face-off with defendant, a goodly number of curious or aroused bar patrons gathered in the doorway, necessitating the officer's call for backup aid.  From all this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant instigated the confrontation, intending to create a public contretemps with the potentiality of a public escalation, and was, therefore, well within the penal statute's prohibition.  The fact that the defendant slipped away from the officer's grasp and reentered the bar after the street confrontation further supports a ready inference that the defendant intended to cause a &quot;public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The court interpreted the statute as having the nonneutral effect of allowing the religious community of a village to create its own school district.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Establishment of Religion - Validity of Statute Permitting Creation of School District Solely within Municipality to Meet Required Educational Needs - Governmental Neutrality Laws of 1994 (ch 241) (adding Education Law &sect; 1504 [3]), which provides that any municipality located wholly within a single central or union free school district but whose boundaries are not coterminous with the boundaries of the preexisting school district, may establish its own school district &quot;whenever the educational interests of the community require it&quot;, provided that certain criteria pertaining to the enrollment and the actual valuation per total wealth pupil of new and existing school districts are met, is unconstitutional as violative of Establishment Clause neutrality principles.  Notwithstanding its purported facial neutrality, chapter 241 has the nonneutral effect of allowing the Village of Kiryas Joel, whose residents are members of the Satmar Hasidic religious sect, but no other group at this time and probably ever, to create its own school district. Under the Establishment Clause, government must maintain a course of neutrality among religions, and between religion and nonreligion.  The provision of a governmental benefit to a restricted class, when that class is formed along religious lines, is a telling index of nonneutral sectarian effect.  Here, the qualifying criteria and the definitional cutoff, which limits a &quot;municipality&quot; to &quot;a city, town or village in existence as of the effective date of this subdivision&quot; (Education Law &sect; 1504 [3] [g], added by L 1994, ch 241) and thereby cuts off any group, religious or nonreligious, subsequently incorporated as a municipality from utilizing the procedure established by chapter 241, are drawn in such a way that the benefit flows only to a single sect. Since no existing municipalities aside from Kiryas Joel now meet the statutory criteria, the only possibility that any other municipality will become eligible is if one were prospectively to experience a population or wealth shift sufficient to satisfy the eligibility criteria.  However, any group that lacked the foresight to incorporate as a village before the enactment of the statute will be barred from creating its own school district. Out of more than 1,500 municipalities in the State of New York, Kiryas Joel is the only one now able to benefit from the law's provisions and is likely to be the only one ever to qualify. Moreover, the neutrality problem flowing from chapter 241 is not eliminated by the statutory provision requiring approval of the new district both by the municipality seeking to create its own district and by the preexisting district (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect; 1504 [3] [b], as added by L 1994, ch 241).  Only Kiryas Joel presently qualifies to submit the new district proposal for voter approval, and it is this virtually exclusive preference, not the procedure set up under the statute after a municipality qualifies, that fails the test of neutrality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Establishment of Religion - Validity of Statute Permitting Creation of School District Solely within Municipality to Meet Required Educational Needs - Governmental Advancement or Promotion of Religion Laws of 1994 (ch 241) (adding Education Law &sect; 1504 [3]), which provides that any municipality located wholly within a single central or union free school district but whose boundaries are not coterminous with the boundaries of the preexisting school district, may establish its own school district &quot;whenever the educational interests of the community require it&quot;, provided that certain criteria pertaining to the enrollment and the actual valuation per total wealth pupil of new and existing school districts are met, has the nonneutral effect of allowing the Village of Kiryas Joel, whose residents are members of the Satmar Hasidic religious sect, but no other group at this time and probably ever, to create its own school district and, therefore, is unconstitutional under the second prong of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lemon v Kurtzman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (403 US 602) in that its primary effect is to advance or promote religion. The central question to be answered under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lemon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s second prong is whether the challenged governmental action is sufficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices.  The actual effect of the challenged State action, and not merely its stated purpose, is a proper subject of Establishment Clause scrutiny.  Further, in conducting the endorsement inquiry, a court must take into account the context in which the State has acted.  Here, the enactment of chapter 241 would be perceived as an act of governmental favor for the sole benefit of the Satmar sect. Chapter 241 was enacted into law after the Supreme Court issued its decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Kiryas Joel I</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (512 US 687) striking down Laws of 1989 (ch 748), which created a Kiryas Joel School District, as an act of legislative favoritism.  Chapter 241 was adopted in direct response to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Kiryas Joel I</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ruling to provide the Village of Kiryas Joel with an alternative mechanism to secure its own school district. Laws of 1994 (ch 279), a companion statute to chapter 241, expressly authorizes the district's continued operation and specifically contemplates that a Kiryas Joel School District will be reconstituted pursuant to Education Law article 31.  While the Legislature was perfectly within its authority in attempting to cure the constitutional infirmity of a prior law, the Legislature's attempt to remedy chapter 748 through the enactment of chapter 241 produced a law whose actual effect confers a benefit on the religious community of Kiryas Joel alone and for all practical purposes effectively replicates the prior unconstitutional law.  Viewed in the context of its history and effect, the enactment of chapter 241 bestows an unmistakable imprimatur of State approval on the Satmar sect. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the collateral estoppel doctrine did not automatically block or limit the action and alternatives available to the educational entity and that the fact the gun had been suppressed in a prior juvenile delinquency proceeding was not preclusive. The educational entity did not share actual or functional identity as parties and did not receive in the delinquency proceedings any opportunity to contest the issues suffusing its educational responsibilities, especially as they were so prominently affected by the presence of the gun on school premises and the manner in which it was perceived and seized by school personnel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Students - Suspension - Collateral Estoppel Effect in Educational Disciplinary Proceeding of Suppression Determination in Juvenile Delinquency Proceeding In an educational disciplinary review proceeding, educational authorities were not precluded from reviewing the reasonableness and legality of the seizure of a gun from a student in a school hallway under the doctrine of collateral estoppel based upon the suppression of the gun in a prior Family Court juvenile delinquency proceeding, instituted and prosecuted by the presentment agency in the name of the New York City Corporation Counsel pursuant to distinctively delegated special authorization in Family Court Act &sect; 310.1.  For the doctrine of collateral estoppel to apply, the identical issue necessarily must have been decided in the prior action and be decisive of the present action, and the party to be precluded from relitigating the issue must have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination. Here, the educational authorities in the disciplinary review proceeding did not share identity as parties and were not allied with the special role of the Corporation Counsel as presentment agency, and were not afforded any full or fair opportunity to litigate their concerns in the Family Court juvenile delinquency proceeding. They are not in legal or practical privity with the presentment agency; they had no legal or functional party status in the Family Court proceeding.  In law, purpose and actual practice, the procedures and wider educational community concerns of the Board of Education and of its Chancellor are functionally and fundamentally discrete and independent from the presentment agency and that office's uniquely delegated and described responsibility in a juvenile delinquency proceeding in Family Court, such as was presented here.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was granted permission to appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the county court convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to a minimum of two and a maximum of four years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from his conviction and sentence, defendant argued that he was improperly sentenced as a second felony offender because his prior convictions were for traffic felonies, which were not predicate felonies for sentencing purposes under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(i). He contended that his equal protection rights were violated by treating his two prior traffic felonies as predicate felonies, subjecting him to harsher punishment based solely on the order in which the crimes were committed. The court disagreed and affirmed, noting that the express language of &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(i) did not require the prior felony to be defined as such by the Penal Law in order to qualify as a second felony offender. Rather, no restrictive language preceded the statute's definition of &quot;predicate felony conviction&quot; for sentencing purposes. The court reasoned that the legislature designed N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(i) to punish a Penal Law felony offender more harshly based on both the nature of the second felony and the commission of any prior felony. The statute served an important deterrent purpose that was neither irrational nor unconstitutional. Defendant's other argument was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, subdivision (1) (b) (i) stands in sharp contrast to Penal Law &sect; 70.06 (1) (a), which explicitly limits second felony offender status to individuals who commit a &quot;felony defined in this chapter&quot;. The Legislature designed Penal Law &sect; 70.06 (1) (b) (i) to punish a Penal Law felony offender more harshly based on both the nature of the second felony and the commission of any prior felony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city, joined by the Municipal Water Finance Authority and the Water Board, sought a declaratory judgment that the defendant city comptroller acted in excess of his powers and an injunction. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) dismissed the action and declared that a proposed sale of the water system to the Water Board was not authorized. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city leased the water system to the New York City Water Board (board). When it was confronted with a budget deficit, the city proposed to sell the system to the board with the Municipal Water Finance Authority (authority) to issue bonds to finance the purchase. The court concluded that no Environmental Impact Statement was required. When the comptroller refused to issued the bonds the city sued, but the supreme court dismissed its complaint on the ground that the bond issuance was not authorized by the governing statute. On appeal, the court agreed. The New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Act did not permit the authority to issue bonds to finance the purchase. The use of the authority's debt power was permissible only if the purchase of the water system was a &quot;water project&quot; or furthered &quot;other corporate purposes&quot; of the authority. The water system was not a &quot;water project.&quot; The court held that statutory authorization to issue bonds for payment of the cost of a &quot;water project&quot; contemplated something less than financing the purchase of the entire water system, and funding the city's general capital needs was not among the &quot;corporate purposes&quot; of the authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the city's complaint to compel the comptroller to issue bonds to finance a purchase of the city's water system by the city's water board was affirmed because the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Act did not permit the proposed transaction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Water Districts - Validity of Proposed Sale of New York City Water System to New York City Water Board The New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Act (L 1984, chs 513-515) does not permit the New York City Water Finance Authority to issue bonds to finance New York City's proposed sale of its Water System to the New York City Water Board, the proceeds of which would both be applied to retiring the City's pre-1984 water and sewer debt and spent on non-Water System-related capital projects in the City.  Under the statutory language, use of the Authority's debt power is permissible only if the purchase of the Water System on the terms proposed is of a &quot;water project&quot; or furthers &quot;other corporate purposes&quot; of the Authority (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1045-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">o</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [1]).  However, in permitting the Authority to issue bonds to cover necessary costs, the Legislature contemplated that a &quot;water project&quot; would be a component of the Water System, not the Water System itself.  Nor is issuance of bonds to fund this particular transaction among the &quot;other corporate purposes&quot; of the Authority.  The Act was adopted to facilitate the financing of needed expenditures for the maintenance and improvement of the Water System. Nowhere is there a hint that the Authority's purposes include the raising of revenues for unrelated City capital projects.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Bonds - Construction of Municipal Bond Legislation In determining whether the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Act (L 1984, chs 513-515) permits the New York City Water Finance Authority to issue bonds to finance New York City's proposed sale of its Water System to the New York City Water Board, the Court gives effect to the plain meaning of the words used in the statute, thereby implementing the intent of the Legislature, and declines to adopt the proffered new statutory interpretation standard that municipal bond arrangements must be upheld unless &quot;patently illegal.&quot; The deference exemplified by the &quot;patently illegal&quot; standard is most appropriate in reviewing challenges to municipal financing legislation as exceeding constitutional limitations, not whether the legislation permits the proposed transaction.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner sought review of an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which dismissed his action alleging that respondent New York Department of Environmental Conservation's (Department) denial of his application for a variance constituted an unconstitutional taking under the United States and New York Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department denied the landowner's application for two building variances due to legislation enacted to preserve wetlands. The landowner argued that the denial was a taking despite the fact that the legislation was fully enacted and in force when he purchased the property. The court disagreed and held that the denial was proper. In so holding, the court found that (1) the Department's finding that the landowner had not sustained his burden of showing that the variances would not have an adverse impact on the tidal wetlands contained on the property was supported by substantial evidence; (2) the landowner never owned an absolute right to build on his land without a variance and a taking claim could not be based on an interest he never owned; (3) the economic value of the property had not been extinguished by the denial because the property could be used for recreational purposes; and (4) the landowner's reasonable expectations were not affected when the property remained restricted because such expectations were reflected by the landowner's consideration of the property's limitations when he made the purchase offer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the landowner's petition was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Tidal Wetlands - Regulation of Property Prior to Purchase by Claimant The denial of a building variance pursuant to environmental regulation does not effect an unconstitutional taking (US Const Fifth Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 7) for which the landowner must be justly compensated where the legislation was fully enacted and in force when he purchased the property.  A property interest must exist before it may be &quot;taken&quot;.  Similarly, a taking claim may not be based upon property rights that have already been taken away from a landowner in favor of the public.  Once taken, property interests are no longer owned by the private landowner and may not be sold by such party.  Rather, a promulgated regulation forms part of the title to property as a preexisting rule of State law.  While the remaining property interests may still be freely transferred by the landowner, a purchaser's title is necessarily limited to and by those property interests alone.  Although petitioner's permit application was entitled to due consideration, petitioner's claim that the denial of his variance was a &quot;taking&quot; must fail because he never owned an absolute right to build on his land without a variance. Since the enactment of the wetlands regulations, the only permissible uses for the subject property were dependent upon those regulations which were a legitimate exercise of police power. Petitioner cannot base a taking claim upon an interest he never owned.  The relevant property interests owned by the petitioner are defined by those State laws enacted and in effect at the time he took title and they are not dependent on the timing of State action pursuant to such laws.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Tidal Wetlands - Denial of Variance - Substantial Evidence A determination of the Department of Environmental Conservation denying petitioner two setback variances from the requirements of 6 NYCRR 661.6, which govern tidal wetlands, to enable him to construct a single-family home on his parcel is supported by substantial evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Tidal Wetlands - Diminution of Value and Limitation of Uses Due to Regulation While petitioner's claim that the denial of a variance from the requirements of 6 NYCRR 661.6 to enable him to construct a single-family home on a parcel that was subject to regulation as tidal wetlands prior to the time he purchased the parcel was a &quot;taking&quot; must fail solely because he never owned an absolute right to build on his land without a variance, petitioner's taking claim would also be infirm under an analysis of whether the regulations result in a taking of petitioner's property by depriving the landowner of his property rights. The fact that a regulation deprives the property of its most beneficial use does not render it unconstitutional.  There is support in the record for Supreme Court's conclusion that the economic value of the property had not been extinguished since it could still be used for recreational purposes and that petitioner's reasonable expectations were reflected by his consideration of the inherent limitations on the property when he made the purchase offer for thousands less than its worth without the restrictions.  Thus, his &quot;reasonable&quot; expectations were not affected when the property remained restricted.  Moreover, petitioner had the burden of showing that it is unreasonable to expect relief from a zoning restriction with respect to his claim that the finding of value does not take into account the fact that the nonresidential uses proposed by the Department of Environmental Conservation that add value to his land may not be undertaken without a variance from the Village.  Although petitioner did not have to complete the application process to meet his burden on the issue, his conclusory assertion that the zoning variance would not be granted is insufficient when the record contains ample and convincing evidence to the contrary.  The Village Law provides that a variance may be granted if an applicant cannot realize a reasonable return without it (Village Law &sect; 7-712-b [2] [b]).  The value of the subject property was, at most, diminished as restricted by the regulations. Thus, the alleged diminution of value and limitation of property uses caused by the environmental regulations would fall well within constitutional boundaries.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court (New York), which affirmed the trial court's determination that no taking of their land occurred when appellee city raised a road to the legal grade by placing side fill on the property abutting the public roadway. The property owners appealed, contending that the lower court erred in holding that there was no permanent physical occupation of their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners contended that placing the side fill on their property was an unconstitutional taking without just compensation and, hence, a taking. The city argued that in exercising its police powers to raise a portion of the property so that it met the legal grade of the abutting roadway, it did not take any of the property owner's land in violation of any state or federal constitution. The court found in favor of the city, holding that the common law and city charter obligated the property owners to provide lateral support to a public roadway. Thus, by virtue of the common law and city charter, the property owner's title never encompassed the property interest they claimed had been taken. The court found that when the property owners acquired title to their property, they acquired ownership of the entire parcel, including the portion abutting the public roadway, subject to the obligation to maintain lateral support to the roadway's legal grade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Property Encumbered by Prevailing Rule of State Property Law When Acquired Plaintiffs are not entitled to compensation for the portion of their property on which the City of New York placed side fill to maintain lateral support for a regraded public road that abutted their property because plaintiffs acquired their property with constructive notice that the property abutted a public road that was below the legal grade and, in regrading the road and raising a portion of plaintiffs' property up to the legal grade, the City acted pursuant to a long-standing common-law principle and in conformity with a provision of its Charter that was in force when plaintiffs acquired title to their property.  Because the State defines the rights and obligations that constitute &quot;property&quot; in the absence of any superseding Federal law, the threshold step in a physical or regulatory takings inquiry is to determine whether, in light of the existing rules or understandings of State law, plaintiffs ever possessed the property interest they now claim has been taken by the challenged governmental action.  Further, in identifying the background rules of State property law that inhere in an owner's title, a court should look to the law in force, whatever its source, when the owner acquired the property.  Here, plaintiffs' obligation to preserve and maintain the legal grade has its roots in New York's common-law obligation of lateral support. Further, the property owner's obligation of lateral support to a public roadway finds its specific, contemporary formulation in New York City Charter &sect; 2904 (2), which was in force when plaintiffs bought their property.  Thus, the lateral-support obligation imposed on plaintiffs was a prevailing rule of the State's property law when they acquired their property and, accordingly, encumbered plaintiffs' title and the constituent bundle of rights.  The City's enforcement of this legal obligation therefore does not constitute a taking of any property interest owned by plaintiffs for which they are entitled to compensation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant, an attorney for an abstract company, was discharged after he was convicted of mail fraud, violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341, when he allegedly submitted a false insurance claim. The claimant alleged that he was not ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits, under N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 593(4), because his crime did not occur &quot;in connection with&quot; his employment. The court rejected his argument. The court ruled that the phrase &quot;in connection with&quot; did not solely relate to felony crimes committed against the employer, or during business hours. Rather, the court found that this phrase also included any activity that disregarded the standards of conduct which the employer had a right to expect from his employees. Here, the court found that the claimant breached his duty to remain qualified for his position when he was automatically disbarred, after his conviction was final. Moreover, the claimant's conduct further breached the duty he owed to his employer because it impaired his ability to do his job, and tarnished his employer's reputation for trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unemployment Insurance - Benefits - Disqualification - Act Constituting Felony A felony is &quot;in connection with&quot; employment for purposes of Labor Law &sect; 593 (4), which disallows unemployment insurance benefits for a period of one year after a claimant loses his or her job as a result of an act constituting a felony &quot;in connection with&quot; that employment, if it results in breach of a duty, express or implied, the claimant owes the employer.  The scope of such duty will vary depending on the nature of the employment involved.  Accordingly, benefits were properly denied appellant, an attorney whose employment as Chief Title Counsel to a title abstract company was terminated after his conviction of a felony arising from his submission of a false insurance claim for theft of personal property.  Here, appellant violated a basic duty owed his employer: to remain qualified for his position, a status he lost when he was automatically disbarred under Judiciary Law &sect; 90 (4) (a).  Moreover, appellant's employer was a fiduciary entrusted with handling funds for real estate closings and also acted as agent for insurance companies underwriting title insurance policies for its customers and, as Chief Title Counsel, appellant personally dealt with numerous insurance companies.  Thus, his conviction for defrauding an insurance company not only impaired his ability to perform his job effectively but also necessarily tarnished his employer's reputation for trustworthiness in the relevant business community. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance carriers sought a declaration that N.Y. Tax Law art. 15 was unconstitutional and an injunction against its implementation. The supreme court enjoined enforcement, and the appellate division reversed. The court of appeals affirmed the appellate division's order. Article 15 was presumptively constitutional. Plaintiffs' challenge to article 15 rested on speculative assertions since article 15 had not yet gone into effect. It was premature to conclude that article 15 would result in double taxation or the overpayment of taxes. If and when an individual was actually injured by article 15, the court would consider its constitutionality at that time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate division's order, because plaintiffs' challenge to the statute hinged on speculative assertions inasmuch as the statute had not yet gone into effect and no one had yet been subjected to double taxation or an overpayment of taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Sales and Use Taxes - Prepayment of Sales Tax on Motor Vehicle Damage Insurance Awards - Possibility of Denial of Refund Request An order of the Appellate Division which reversed an order granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from enforcing Tax Law article 15, which provides for the prepayment by insurers of sales tax on motor vehicle damage insurance awards, and granted defendants summary judgment declaring the statute constitutional, should be affirmed where plaintiffs allege that the statutory scheme violates due process because it does not allow for a refund in the event that the funds remitted to the State by insurers exceed the amount of sales tax actually assessed, since it cannot be presumed that a refund would be denied.  The statute does not on its face preclude the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance from refunding excessive or double taxes to claimants or insurers; rather, it specifically incorporates the provisions of Tax Law article 28, which provides for the refund or credit of taxes improperly collected or paid, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with any provision of Tax Law article 15, and that general refund provision is not inconsistent with the two specific sales tax refund provisions of article 15 (i.e., &sect; 341 [e] [1], [2]).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petroleum companies that were subject to the state franchise and petroleum taxes and the city's general corporation tax instituted a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that New York City, N.Y., Admin.

The court on appeal agreed that &sect; 11-602(8)(b)(3) lacked either a constitutional or a statutory basis on which to ground its disallowance on the deduction, even though it was originally valid. The court found that the state had amended the authorizing legislation for this prohibition and now allowed corporate taxpayers to deduct petroleum taxes when calculating net income for purposes of the N.Y. Tax Law art. 9-A franchise tax. Consequently, the court held that the corresponding city provision for general corporation taxes was unconstitutional under N.Y. Const. art.

Under our form of State government, the exclusive power of taxation is lodged in the State Legislature (NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 1).  Municipalities such as the City of New York have no inherent taxing power, but only that which is delegated by the State.  Moreover, the delegation of State taxing power to a municipality must be made in express terms by enabling legislation. Here, the enabling act, which granted the City the authority to enact local legislation imposing a net income tax on businesses in a form &quot;substantially&quot; following a Model Local Law appended to the enabling act (L 1966, ch 772), and which, as amended, states that the City's general corporation tax shall &quot;substantially&quot; follow the Model Local Law, but &quot;may be amended for the purpose of conforming it with similar provisions of article[] 9-A [of the State Tax Law] ... as presently in effect or as they may be amended&quot; (L 1967, ch 699, &sect; 1), requires continuing conformity with either the Model Local Law or a provision of article 9-A.  For section 11-602 (8) (b) (3) to fall within the parameters of the enabling act, therefore, it must derive its authority from a provision of the Model Local Law or article 9-A of the State Tax Law. The Model Local Law, however, contains no provision prohibiting the deduction of article 13-A taxes.  Moreover, once the State repealed Tax Law &sect; 208 (9) (b) (4), which prohibited the deduction of article 13-A taxes, the necessary State law predicate for the City's prohibition of the deduction was eliminated.  The subsequent enforcement of section 11-602 (8) (b) (3) transgresses the fixed parameters and exceeds the authorization of the enabling act, and therefore violates article XVI, &sect; 1 of the State Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

Under article IX, &sect; 2 of the State Constitution, a special law which relates to the property, affairs or government of New York City violates the Constitution unless enacted upon a home rule message from the City.  Chapter 13 is a special law because it applies only to New York City, and it relates to the &quot;property, affairs or government&quot; of New York City as it regulates the bargaining process between the City and its police department members and thus relates to the terms and conditions of employment of this local public safety force.  Moreover, chapter 13 cannot be upheld under any substantial State interest exception to the requirements of article IX, &sect; 2 of the Constitution since chapter 13 does not serve to advance nor is it reasonably related to the professed State concerns which prompted its enactment--serious public safety concerns.  Chapter 13 itself does not expressly identify any State concern motivating its enactment, and the legislative history of chapter 13 discloses that the reason for chapter 13's introduction and passage was to create State-wide uniformity with respect to impasse procedures available to police department members under Civil Service Law &sect; 209.  </SPAN></P>

A special law is one &quot;which in terms and in effect applies to one or more, but not all ... cities&quot; (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 3 [d] [4]).  By virtue of chapter 13, only New York City, among all units of local government throughout the State, is prohibited from providing for a local public employment relations board with jurisdiction over binding arbitration procedures when an impasse is reached in negotiations with its police force. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Home Rule Powers - Standard for Applicability of State Interest Exception to Home Rule Provisions of State Constitution For the State constitutionally to enact a special law on local affairs without complying with home rule requirements (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2), its interest in the subject matter must be substantial and, as a corollary to the constitutional balancing of overlapping local and State interests requiring that the subjects of State concern must be directly and substantially involved, the enactment must bear a reasonable relationship to the legitimate, accompanying substantial State concern.  Thus, State legislation impacting especially on a locality is only valid if it can be stated that the statutes in question serve a supervening State concern, and relate to life, health and quality of life of the People of the State.  The substantial State concern which will be permitted to trump constitutional home rule requirements regarding a particular enactment cannot be derived purely from speculative assertions on possible State-wide implications of the subject matter, having no support in the language, structure or legislative history of the statute.  To the contrary, reliance should be placed upon the stated purpose and legislative history of the act in question to find, or reject, a substantial State concern.  </SPAN></P>

In the absence of evidence that the Legislature would have intended that section 2's amendment of Civil Service Law &sect; 209 remain effective if the primary purpose of the act--to provide PERB with jurisdiction over an impasse between the City and its police force--could not be given effect, there is no basis to sever chapter 13 and uphold section 2.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this combined action for a declaratory judgment and N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 relief, respondent non-resident taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 631 (b) (6), which disallowed non-residents a full deduction for alimony payments from their New York State income tax liability. The lower court declared the statute violative of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and respondent tax commissioner appealed. The court reversed, ruling that disparate tax treatment of alimony paid by a non-resident was fully justified in light of the disparate treatment of income: nonresidents were taxed only on income earned in New York, while residents were taxed on all income earned from whatever sources. The disallowance was substantially justified by the fact that respondent taxpayers' alimony payments were wholly linked to personal activities outside the state. The state's treatment of alimony deductions was rationally related to its substantial policy of taxing only those gains realized and losses incurred by a non-resident in New York and was rationally related to its policy of limiting a non-resident's deductions to those attributable to income-producing activities in New York.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's judgment and held that the New York Tax Law disallowing respondent non-resident taxpayers a full deduction for alimony payments from their New York State income tax liability was constitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Personal Income Tax - Constitutionality of Statute Disallowing Alimony Deduction to Nonresident - Privileges and Immunities Clause Tax Law &sect; 631 (b) (6), which disallows nonresidents a full deduction for alimony payments from their New York State income tax liability, is not unconstitutional as violative of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution.  The Privileges and Immunities Clause does not mandate absolute equality in tax treatment and is not violated where there is a substantial reason for the difference in treatment, and the discrimination practiced against nonresidents bears a substantial relationship to the State's objective.  New York's disparate tax treatment of alimony paid by a nonresident is fully justified in light of the disparate treatment of income: nonresidents are taxed only on income earned in New York, while residents are taxed on all income earned from whatever sources.  The advantage granted residents is offset by the additional burden of being taxed on all sources of income.  Nonresidents are not denied all benefit of the alimony deduction since they can claim the full amount of such payments in computing the hypothetical tax liability &quot;as if a resident&quot; under Tax Law &sect; 601 (e). Furthermore, the disallowance is substantially justified by the fact that petitioner's alimony payments are wholly linked to personal activities outside the State.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Personal Income Tax - Constitutionality of Statute Disallowing Alimony Deduction to Nonresident - Equal Protection and Commerce Clauses Tax Law &sect; 631 (b) (6), which disallows nonresidents a full deduction for alimony payments from their New York State income tax liability, is not unconstiutional as violative of the Equal Protection and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution.  Nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment prevents the States from imposing unequal taxation on nonresidents, so long as the inequality is rationally related to the furtherance of a legitimate State interest.  New York's treatment of alimony deductions is rationally related to its substantial policy of taxing only those gains realized and losses incurred by a nonresident in New York, while taxing residents on all income from whatever sources.  Further, the challenged treatment is rationally related to its policy of limiting a nonresident's deductions to those attributable to income-producing activities in New York.  Even if this matter concerning alimony payments were deemed to involve interstate commerce, the statute would not violate the Commerce Clause for the same reason.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimants sought review of the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of the Court of Claims granting a motion by respondent State to dismiss the claimant's civil rights claims and dismissing the claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants instituted an action on behalf of nonwhite males, who were stopped and examined by police while investigating a stabbing. The claimants sought monetary damages, alleging unconstitutional acts on the part of the State. The State moved to dismiss, contending that the court of original jurisdiction lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and that the claimants failed to state a cause of action. It granted the motion, holding that: 1) constitutional torts were not cognizable in that court; 2) that direct actions for violations of the New York State Constitution's Bill of Rights, specifically the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and the right to equal protection under the law, under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11 and 12, were not cognizable claims absent some link to a common-law &quot;traditional&quot; tort; 3) that actions for negligent training and supervision were not cognizable claims where the underlying harms were themselves not matters within the court's jurisdiction; and 4) that actions based on 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1981 do not lie against states. The court modified the decision, finding subject-matter jurisdiction and cognizable state constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction over all the causes of action asserted. The court found that the claimants' causes of action based on violations of the New York State Constitution, as well as a claim for negligent training and supervision, were facially sufficient to state causes of action. They were to be reinstated. The remaining causes of action were properly dismissed. The lower court's judgment was modified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Torts -- Constitutional Torts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A constitutional tort is any action for damages for violation of a constitutional right against a government or individual defendants.  Constitutions assign rights to individuals and impose duties on the government to regulate the government's actions to protect them.  It is the failure to fulfill a stated constitutional duty which may support a claim for damages in a constitutional tort action.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Court of Claims -- Jurisdiction of Constitutional Tort Claims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Damage claims against the State based upon violations of the State Constitution come within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.  The State's waiver of sovereign immunity contained in Court of Claims Act &sect; 8, which provides that &quot;[t]he state hereby waives its immunity from liability and action and hereby assumes liability and consents to have the same determined in accordance with the same rules of law as applied to actions in the supreme court against individuals or corporations&quot;, includes all claims over which the Court of Claims has jurisdiction--appropriation, breach of contract and torts--and applies the rule of respondeat superior to the State (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Court of Claims Act &sect; 9 [2]).  Inasmuch as there is no clear definition by which wrongs are classified as torts, the Legislature could not have used the term when enacting section 9 (2) with a precision that would limit the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims solely to common-law torts or those recognized at the time.  It is more likely that the term was used generally to indicate a branch of the law broader than the then-existing categories and subject to expansion as new wrongs supporting liability were recognized.  Moreover, while the waiver contained in section 8 is limited to liability actions similar to those which may be brought in Supreme Court against individuals and corporations (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Court of Claims Act &sect;&sect; 8, 12 [1]), constitutional torts are sufficiently similar to claims which may be asserted by individuals and corporations in Supreme Court to satisfy the statutory requirement.  Accordingly, the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims is not limited to common-law tort causes of action, and damage claims against the State based upon violations of the State Constitution come within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Claim against State -- Viability of Claims Based on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">42 USC &sect; 1981</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the Court of Claims has jurisdiction to hear claims based on 42 USC &sect; 1981, claimants do not state causes of action against the State pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1981 based upon the actions of State defendants relating to the stop, questioning and examination of the nonwhite claimants during an investigation of a crime.  No suit lies against the State under 42 USC &sect; 1983 because the State is not a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of the statute, and section 1983 provides the exclusive Federal damages remedy for violation of the rights guaranteed by section 1981.  Thus, the State is not a &quot;person&quot; within the statute and it cannot be liable in an action based on section 1981.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Claim against State -- Viability of Claims Based on Violations of Equal Protection and Search and Seizure Clauses of State Constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A cause of action to recover damages may be asserted against the State for violation of the Equal Protection and Search and Seizure Clauses of the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect;&sect; 11, 12).  The rights guaranteed by these two provisions have common-law antecedents warranting a tort remedy for invasion of the rights they recognize.  Moreover, implying a damage remedy here is consistent with the purposes underlying the duties imposed by these provisions and is necessary and appropriate to ensure the full realization of the rights they state.  Further, these sections establish a duty sufficient to support causes of action to secure the liberty interests guaranteed to individuals by the State Constitution independent of any common-law tort rule.  Common-law tort rules are heavily influenced by overriding concerns of adjusting losses and allocating risks, matters that have little relevance when constitutional rights are at stake.  In addition, the duties imposed upon government officers by these provisions address something far more serious than the private wrongs regulated by the common law. Damages are a necessary deterrent for such misconduct. Accordingly, claimants' allegations that the defendant State's officers and employees deprived them of the right to be free from unlawful police conduct violating the Search and Seizure Clause and that claimants were treated discriminatorily in violation of the State Equal Protection Clause, based upon police actions in connection with the stop, questioning and examination of claimants while investigating a crime, are facially sufficient to state causes of action. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After her discharge, appellant employee, a practicing Seventh Day Adventist, filed a discrimination complaint with respondent, the State of New York, Executive Department, Division of Human Rights (Division), alleging that respondents, employer and union, had violated N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(10)(a). The Division found in favor of the employee. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division annulled the Division's order. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was undisputed that the employee was discharged only because of her inability to work a normal weekend shift due to her religion. The employer argued that it was excused from its duty to accommodate the employee because it had a collective bargaining agreement with the union, which required that senior employees be given preference in selecting their days off. The employee and the Division contended that the collective bargaining agreement did not expressly prohibit voluntary &quot;swaps&quot; and, therefore, it did not shield the employer from its good-faith responsibility under &sect; 296(10)(a). On appeal, the court first held that &sect; 296(10)(a), by its terms, applied only to employers. Thus, the union was not a proper party to the action. The court also held that the appellate court should not have exonerated the employer. The employer did not have to file a formal grievance to force the union to permit it to arrange a voluntary &quot;swap&quot; for the employee. However, the employer did have a duty to take reasonable steps in an effort to reach an accommodation of the employee's religious needs. The employer failed to show that it exerted such reasonable efforts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the order exonerating the employer but otherwise affirmed and remitted the case to the appellate court for consideration of issues raised but not considered on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Discrimination in Employment - Collective Bargaining Agent as Employer In a proceeding pursuant to the Human Rights Law (Executive Law &sect; 290 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) alleging that complainant's employer and her collective bargaining agent discriminated against her because of her religiously motivated Sabbath observance (Executive Law &sect; 296 [10]), the collective bargaining agent is not a proper party.  Executive Law &sect; 296 (10) (a), the sole predicate for this Human Rights Law proceeding, makes it unlawful &quot;for any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">employer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to prohibit, prevent or disqualify any person from, or otherwise to discriminate against any person in, obtaining or holding employment, because of his observance of any particular day or days ... as a sabbath ... in accordance with the requirements of his religion&quot; (emphasis supplied).  By its terms, the prohibition is aimed only at employers, a class that plainly does not include the collective bargaining agent in this situation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Discrimination in Employment - Religion - Observation of Sabbath In a proceeding pursuant to the Human Rights Law (Executive Law &sect; 290 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), an order of the State Division of Human Rights finding that complainant's employer discriminated against her by discharging her because of her inability to work a normal weekend shift due to her religiously motivated Sabbath observance (Executive Law &sect; 296 [10]) is upheld.  Where, as here, the mandate of the statute conflicts with the strictures of a collective bargaining agreement, which complainant's union interpreted as requiring that senior employees be given preference in selecting their days off, an employer caught in such a conflict is obligated only to make a &quot;good faith&quot; effort to accommodate a Sabbath-observing employee.  The &quot;good faith&quot; standard requires that the employer show that it exerted reasonable efforts to accommodate its Sabbath-observing employees.  This standard does not require proof that an accommodation was actually found, but rather that a genuine search for reasonable alternatives was undertaken.  Here, although the employer did not have to go so far as to file a formal grievance to force the union to permit it to arrange a voluntary &quot;swap&quot; for the complainant, the employer did have a duty to take reasonable steps short of such labor litigation in an effort to reach an accommodation of her religious needs.  The record, however, is devoid of proof that any such steps were taken.  Since there was no showing that such a search was conducted here and since it is undisputed that the complainant was discharged only because of her inability to work a normal weekend shift, the finding of the Human Rights Division that the employer violated section 296 (10) was supported by substantial evidence and its determination should be upheld.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Court of Appeals - Remand to Administrative Agency In a proceeding pursuant to the Human Rights Law (Executive Law &sect; 290 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) in which the Appellate Division annulled an order of the State Division of Human Rights finding that complainant's employer discriminated against her by discharging her because of her inability to work a normal weekend shift due to her religiously motivated Sabbath observance (Executive Law &sect; 296 [10]), and the Court of Appeals modified the Appellate Division order by reversing the order insofar as it exonerated the employer, the matter is remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration of issues raised but not considered on the appeal to that Court, and there is no need to remand the matter for consideration before the agency.  Once the State Division of Human Rights found probable cause to believe discrimination had occurred and set the matter down for a hearing, it was incumbent on the employer to come forward with whatever proof it had to show that an accommodation could not have been accomplished without undue economic hardship. Having chosen to rely exclusively on the existence of a union-enforced seniority system to establish its economic hardship defense, which the agency rejected, the employer cannot now claim that it should, in fairness, be given a new opportunity to recast its strategy and put forth a different set of facts in defense of its position.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that under the variable supplements fund (VSF) legislation, the New York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) trustees were not required, but were merely permitted to invest in equity securities. The amount of employer contributions to the NYCERS fund was totally unaffected by the legislation either directly or indirectly, and the statutory formula for the transfers of excess investment earnings guarantees that reserved funds would be maintained at a level equivalent to what would exist in the pension fund if all assets were invested in high-grade fixed income debt securities. Thus, the financial integrity of the NYCERS pension reserves to assure the fund's ability to meet its pension obligations was protected. Thus, the transfer of excess investment earnings from the NYCERS pension fund into the VSFs was not a violation of the Pension Impairment Clause, N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7. The court held that the transfer of VSF assets to New York City and the VSF benefit payments to those deemed eligible was not an unconstitutional gift under N.Y. Const. art.

To prevail on a claim of a violation of article V, &sect; 7, plaintiffs, Transit Police retirees who receive NYCERS pension benefits but are statutorily ineligible for VSF benefits, must show that by reason of the formula-based transfer of excess investment earnings from the NYCERS pension fund to the VSFs some benefit set forth in the pension contract of the Administrative Code is diminished or impaired. Here, the statutory formula used to identify surplus investment earnings guaranteed that the pension fund corpus would not be impaired. Inasmuch as no provision of the statutory NYCERS pension contractual relationship requires the pension fund to pass on excess investment earnings to its members, the subsequent transfer of surplus earnings had no impairment effect whatsoever on plaintiffs' retirement benefits by way of reducing the employers' statutory liability for contributions to the pension fund or in any other manner undermining the ability of NYCERS to meet plaintiffs' retirement benefits or pension payment obligations to any other retirees </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code &sect;&sect; 13-127, 13-133).

The variable supplements fund payments here were created through collective bargaining as additional future compensation for services actually rendered by police officers within the bargaining unit during the life of the agreement.  In addition, these supplemental benefit payments serve the important purpose of attracting and retaining qualified candidate-officers and providing an inducement to remain in active police service.  Therefore, these payments do not constitute a gift in violation of article VIII, &sect; 1.  </SPAN></P>

The constitutional prohibition on gifts of public funds is not necessarily subject to statutory definitions of terms or conditions of employment for purposes of governing labor-management relations between civil service employees and public or governmental employers under the Taylor Law (Civil Service Law &sect; 200 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, because the eligible retirees receiving the supplemental payments have furnished a corresponding benefit to the City of New York, the compensatory VSF payments in consideration for those benefits to the municipality do not constitute an impermissible gift within the meaning of the Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Discrimination Based on Disability - Ineligibility of Certain Disability Retirees for Variable Supplements Fund Benefits - Americans with Disabilities Act The limitation on eligibility for variable supplements fund (VSF) benefits to certain retirees of the New York City Housing Police who have attained 20 or more years of service toward the minimum eligibility period for such payments does not improperly exclude officers who have retired as a result of disabilities, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC &sect; 12101 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To fall within the protection of the ADA, an individual must be otherwise qualified for participation in the benefit program of the public entity </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;42 USC &sect; 12132). The term &quot;qualified individual with a disability&quot; is defined as an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by the public entity (42 USC &sect; 12131). Therefore, each of the plaintiffs can only invoke the protection of the ADA if they are qualified individuals who meet the essential eligibility requirements but were &quot;excluded from participation in&quot; or &quot;denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity ... by any such entity&quot; because of their disability (42 USC &sect; 12132). Plaintiffs meet neither of these criteria.  The eligibility requirement for VSF benefits precludes from benefits only officers with less than 20 years of credited service, not those who retired because of a disability. Consequently, the eligibility requirement does not discriminate against or burden disabled individuals in a manner different from or greater than the burdens it places on nondisabled individuals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Discrimination Based on Disability - Ineligibility of Certain Disability Retirees for Variable Supplements Fund Benefits - State Human Rights Law The limitation on eligibility for variable supplements fund (VSF) benefits to certain retirees of the New York City Housing Police who have attained 20 or more years of service toward the minimum eligibility period for such payments does not improperly exclude officers who have retired as a result of disabilities, in violation of the State Human Rights Law (Executive Law &sect; 296 [1] [a]).  Providing a disability pension program separate from a service pension does not violate the Human Rights Law's prohibition against discrimination based on disability. Given the different needs of service and disability retirees and the unique benefits offered to each retirement classification, it cannot be said that the limitation on VSF eligibility wrongly excludes disabled officers in violation of State law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Retirement and Pension Benefits The combined 1987 and 1992-1993 variable supplements fund (VSF) legislation, pursuant to which the VSFs were created out of surplus investment earnings of New York City Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) funds, and the City of New York guaranteed VSF benefit payments to eligible retirees of the New York City Transit Police and Housing Police in return for the transfer of 15% of the VSFs' assets to the City on a one-time basis, is not an unlawful scheme to divert pension funds to the City.  The City and participating employers are required by statute to maintain the NYCERS fund, through annual contributions, at a level which is actuarially sufficient to meet anticipated pension benefit payments irrespective of whether there are transfers of any excess investment earnings. Thus, employer contributions remain unaffected by this legislation.  Independent of any transfer of excess investment earnings to the VSFs, NYCERS can and must maintain a level of employer contributions sufficient to meet existing and anticipated pension fund obligations.  Moreover, the 1987 legislation which created the VSFs out of surplus investment earnings of NYCERS funds was entirely separate from and unrelated to the 1992 and 1993 modifications whereby VSF benefits from the already created VSFs were converted from discretionary payments to definite benefits on a fixed payment schedule.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the legislation established a benefit scheme expressly outside the purview of N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Changes to Police Officer's Variable Supplements Fund - Pension Impairment Clause Laws of 1988 (ch 247), which changed the funding and benefit structure of the Police Officer's Variable Supplements Fund (POVSF), does not unconstitutionally impair contractual pension rights in violation of article V, &sect; 7 of the New York Constitution. The POVSF--a separate fund to be funded from the investment earnings of the existing pension fund and to provide supplemental benefits to some Police Pension Fund members--grew out of collective bargaining negotiations between defendant municipality and plaintiffs' bargaining representative, the Police Benevolent Association (PBA).  In enacting the provisions creating and governing the POVSF in 1970, the Legislature defined the POVSF as not a pension or retirement system, and reserved to the Legislature the unilateral right to amend or repeal the POVSF statutory provisions </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 13-269 [b]; &sect; 13-271 [b] [2]), thereby establishing a benefit scheme expressly outside the purview of article V, &sect; 7.  The legislative history demonstrates that the union and the City agreed to the implementing language that effectively took the POVSF outside the scope of article V, &sect; 7's protections, and plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate on this record that the plaintiffs' collective bargaining representative was acting outside the scope of its representational authority in agreeing to the statutory provisions at issue such as would invalidate the PBA's waiver of the constitutional protections of article V, &sect; 7.  Moreover, there is no public policy barring enforcement of the waiver in this case.  A waiver of article V, &sect; 7's protections, as to funds ordinarily included in the calculation of pension benefits, does not in itself violate public policy, and such a waiver may be implied from the plaintiffs' course of conduct.  Nor is there any general prohibition preventing the creation of benefits for retired public employees that exist separately from the applicable pension or retirement system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Retirement and Pension Benefits - Changes to Police Officer's Variable Supplements Fund - Federal Contract Clause Laws of 1988 (ch 247), which changed the funding and benefit structure of the Police Officer's Variable Supplements Fund (POVSF), a separate fund to be funded from the investment earnings of the existing pension fund and to provide supplemental benefits to some Police Pension Fund members, does not unconstitutionally impair contractual pension rights in violation of the Federal Contract Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, cl [1]).  Analysis of a Contract Clause claim begins with a determination of whether the State law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship. However, where there is no existing contractual agreement regarding the terms changed by the legislation, there is no need to consider whether there was in fact an impairment and whether it was substantial.  Here, under the original implementing legislation, the receipt of POVSF payments was made contingent on the existence of excess Pension Fund investment earnings and on the POVSF trustees' exercise of discretion with respect to disbursements from the supplemental fund.  Consequently, under this benefit scheme, plaintiffs were not assured that funds for supplemental payments would be available, or that the payments, if made, would be of a certain amount or continue for any specified duration.  Moreover, the statute itself expressly stipulated that it did not create any contractual rights as to the POVSF payments (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 13-271 [b]).  Given the highly conditional and discretionary nature of the original benefit scheme, and the express statutory repudiation of any right to disbursements, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that the 1988 legislation changed any terms of an existing contractual relationship. </SPAN></P>

The court agreed with appellant, finding that even though respondent's interest in driving pending his prosecution was substantial, the suspension's temporary nature and the availability of a pre-suspension hearing and immediate hardship relief reduced the risk of erroneous deprivation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The prompt suspension law (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [2] [e] [7]), which under certain circumstances mandates the suspension of a driver's license to operate a motor vehicle pending prosecution for driving while intoxicated, affords the driver all the process that is constitutionally due.  A driver's license is a substantial property interest that may not be deprived without due process of law.  The due process inquiry consists of a balancing of the private interest that will be affected by the official action; the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.  Here, though the private interest affected by the prompt suspension law is substantial, the severity of the license suspension is mitigated by its temporary duration, the availability of a conditional license and hardship relief, and the significant protection of a presuspension judicial hearing, which militates heavily in favor of the statute's constitutionality.  Further weighing against the driver's interest in maintaining his license are the slight risk of an erroneous deprivation and the overriding State interest in the prompt removal of a safety hazard from its streets.  Thus, the prompt suspension law accords with due process requirements.  </SPAN></P>

The prompt suspension law (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [2] [e] [7]), which under certain circumstances mandates the suspension of a driver's license to operate a motor vehicle pending prosecution for driving while intoxicated, entitles the driver to present evidence to rebut the court's tentative findings that the accusatory instrument is sufficient on its face and that there exists reasonable cause to believe that the driver operated a motor vehicle with the proscribed blood alcohol level before the court may order the license suspension. </SPAN></P>

The prompt suspension law (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [2] [e] [7]), which under certain circumstances mandates the suspension of a driver's license to operate a motor vehicle pending prosecution for driving while intoxicated, is not unconstitutionally vague on the ground that subdivision (2) (e) (7) (a) mandates suspension where the driver &quot;at the time of arrest&quot; had a blood alcohol level over .10 of 1%, and it is not a crime to be intoxicated at the time of the arrest.  The language in section 1193 (2) (e) (7) (a) must be read in conjunction with subclause (b), which provides that a prima facie showing for license suspension is established only when the court finds reasonable cause to believe the driver operated a motor vehicle with the proscribed blood alcohol level. The language of subclause (a) does not alter this required prima facie showing and consequently does not render the statute void for vagueness. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Long Island Power Authority - Acquisition and Closure of Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant - Commencement of Payments in Lieu of Taxes With respect to the acquisition and decommissioning of the Long Island Lighting Company's (LILCO) Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant by the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Authorities Law &sect;&sect; 1020--1020-hh), the effective date for substitution of LIPA's obligation to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) for LILCO's real property tax liability on the plant begins with Suffolk County's December 1, 1992 through November 30, 1993 tax year, notwithstanding that the plant was transferred to LIPA on February 29, 1992.  The general rule is that ownership of real estate on the taxable status date determines whether the property is subject to real property taxation for the entire ensuing taxable year, irrespective of the property's subsequent acquisition by a tax-exempt entity during that taxable year. The general rule may be overcome by legislation indicating a contrary intention.  Here, the tax status date for the December 1, 1991 through November 30, 1992 taxable year was June 1, 1991 (Suffolk County Tax Act former &sect; 5), and real property taxes owed on the plant for that taxable year became a lien on that property on December 1, 1991.  Thus, Shoreham's statutory tax-exempt status as property of LIPA did not go into effect before the June 1, 1991 tax status date, and the taxes owed for the December 1, 1991 through November 30, 1992 taxable year became a lien on the property before it was acquired by LIPA.  Moreover, there is no indication in the statutory language or legislative history that the Legislature intended to override the general rule and make Shoreham's tax-exempt status, triggering LIPA's PILOT obligation, effective immediately upon acquisition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Authorities - Long Island Power Authority - Acquisition and Closure of Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant - Calculation of Payments in Lieu of Taxes - Duration of Payments in Lieu of Taxes With respect to the acquisition and decommissioning of the Long Island Lighting Company's (LILCO) Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant by the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Authorities Law &sect;&sect; 1020--1020-hh), LIPA's obligation for payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) for LILCO's real property tax liability on the plant under Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q (1) is perpetual, subject to reduction until its attainment of its legally and properly assessed valuation in a nonoperative state, as determined by way of agreement of the parties to the action, or by a court of competent jurisdiction.  Inasmuch as the LIPA Act only expressly limits the decreases in PILOTs to that point of equivalency to tax levies on a nonoperative facility, the most reasonable construction of section 1020-q (1) directs gradual reduction of the size of PILOTs until they reach a floor level of taxes and assessments which the taxing jurisdictions would have received from LILCO based upon a properly assessed valuation of a defunct Shoreham plant. A total elimination of PILOTs on the Shoreham plant in its nonoperative state would have defeated the overriding purpose of section 1020-q (1), to provide a substitute stream of municipal revenue on all LILCO property acquired by LIPA, for the taxes which fairly and properly would have been received from year to year by each taxing jurisdiction if such acquisition had not occurred.  Moreover, the literal language of section 1020-q (1) controls regarding the rate of reduction of PILOTs and, therefore, PILOTs on Shoreham are to be reduced each year by 10% of the PILOT of the preceding year.  </SPAN></P>

The plain language of Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-q (3) does not prohibit an action by LIPA to recover PILOT overpayments. Section 1020-q (3) bespeaks of a legislative intent limited to relieving the local taxing jurisdictions from the drastic impact of substantial refund liability for past taxes and assessments challenged by LILCO, not PILOTs prospectively imposed following LIPA's acquisition of the Shoreham plant. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the option could not qualify as an option appurtenant and significantly deterred development of the property.

The saving statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law &sect; 9-1.3, mandated that unless a contrary intention appeared, it should be presumed that the creator intended the estate to be valid. Given the contrary intention manifested in the instrument itself, &sect; 9-1.3 was inapplicable. The court found that the remedy of recission could not be applied because there was an irreconcilable conflict in applying a remedy that was designed to void a transaction because it failed to carry out the parties' true intent to a transaction in which the mistake made by the parties was the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, the purpose of which was to defeat the intent of the parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Option to Purchase Commercial Property Options to purchase commercial property are not exempt from the prohibition against remote vesting embodied in New York's Rule against Perpetuities (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]).  The common-law rule against remote vesting encompasses purchase options that might vest beyond the permissible period of 21 years after one or more lives in being at the creation of the estate and any period of gestation involved and, therefore, EPTL 9-1.1 (b) necessarily encompasses such options.  Inasmuch as the common-law prohibition against remote vesting applies to both commercial and noncommercial options, the Legislature intended EPTL 9-1.1 (b) to apply to commercial options as well.  Creation of a general exception to EPTL 9-1.1 (b) for all commercial purchase options would remove an entire class of contingent future interests that the Legislature intended the statute to cover; such statutory reformation would require legislative action.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Remote Vesting - Option to Purchase Commercial Property An option to purchase commercial property which grants its holder absolute power to purchase the property at the holder's whim and at a token price set far below market value, necessarily discourages the property owner from investing in improvements to the property and significantly impedes the owner's ability to sell the property to a third party, as a practical matter rendering it inalienable; thus, the option agreement creates precisely the sort of control over future disposition of the property that EPTL 9-1.1 (b) seeks to prevent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Remote Vesting - Exemption for Option Appurtenant An option to purchase commercial property held by the lessee of a portion of the premises comprised of both commercial space and a theater is not an option appurtenant that is exempt from the prohibition against remote vesting (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]) where the holder of the option occupies only the commercial space, resulting in a disincentive for the owner to improve the theater space because it will eventually be claimed by the option holder at the predetermined purchase price, the option is contained in an agreement separate from the lease, and the option exceeds the term of the lease. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Remote Vesting - Corporate Option to Purchase Commercial Property An option to purchase commercial property created on December 1, 1978 which may be exercised &quot;at any time after July 1, 1979,&quot; so long as the closing date is scheduled during 1987, 1993, 1998 or 2003 permits exercise of the option beyond the permissible period involved (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]).  Where, as here, the parties to a transaction are corporations and no measuring lives are stated in the instruments, the perpetuities period is simply 21 years, and the subject option could potentially be exercised as late as July 2003--more than 24 years after its creation in December 1978.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Remote Vesting - Option to Purchase Commercial Property - Saving Statute With regard to an option to purchase commercial property executed in connection with a sale-partial leaseback of the subject premises, which established a 24-year exercise period by providing that the option may be exercised &quot;at any time after July 1, 1979,&quot; so long as the closing date is scheduled during 1987, 1993, 1998 or 2003, the saving statute (EPTL 9-1.3) cannot be invoked to shorten the duration of the exercise period so as to satisfy the 21-year requirement in the prohibition against remote vesting embodied in New York's Rule against Perpetuities (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]), since the unambiguous language of the option agreement expresses the parties' intent that the option be exercisable &quot;at any time&quot; during a 24-year period.  The saving statute seeks to avoid annulling dispositions due to inadvertent violations of the Rule against Perpetuities by presuming that the creator intended the estate to be valid, but its provisions are merely rules of construction.  While the statute obligates reviewing courts, where possible, to avoid constructions that frustrate the parties' intended purposes, it does not authorize courts to rewrite instruments that unequivocally allow interests to vest outside the perpetuities period.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Remote Vesting - Option to Purchase &quot;At Any Time&quot; after Maturity of Mortgage Note The provision of an option to purchase commercial property executed in connection with a December 31, 1978 sale-partial leaseback of the subject premises that authorizes the option to be exercised &quot;at any time&quot; following the maturity of a mortgage note given to the seller by the buyer allows the option to be exercised after the 21-year period of the prohibition against remote vesting embodied in New York's Rule against Perpetuities (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]), since the only limit on duration is the designation of December 31, 2003 as the latest possible closing date which, when the agreement's 90-day notice period is factored in, would permit the option to be exercised until October 2003.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Remote Vesting - Option to Purchase for Defined Period Contingent on Lease Termination or Mortgage Default The provisions of an option to purchase commercial property executed in connection with a December 31, 1978 sale-partial leaseback of the subject premises, which permit exercise of the option for a defined period contingent on termination of the lease or contingent upon the buyer's default on a purchase-money mortgage given as part of the transaction, allow the option to be exercised after the 21-year period of the prohibition against remote vesting embodied in New York's Rule against Perpetuities (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]), since neither the lease nor the mortgage expires until a date in 2003.  Accordingly, the lease could be terminated, or the buyer could default on the mortgage, some time prior to 2003 but after the 21-year period lapses in December 1999 and the option could be exercised during this interval.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Remote Vesting - Saving Statute - Contingent Option to Purchase With respect to the provisions of an option to purchase commercial property executed in connection with the December 31, 1978 sale-partial leaseback of the subject premises, which permit exercise of the option for a defined period contingent on termination of the lease or contingent upon the buyer's default on a purchase-money mortgage given as part of the transaction, and allow the option to be exercised after the 21-year period of the prohibition against remote vesting embodied in New York's Rule against Perpetuities (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]) because neither the lease nor the mortgage expires until a date in 2003, the duration of the exercise period cannot be shortened to satisfy the 21-year requirement by invoking the presumption under the saving statute (EPTL 9-1.3 [d]) that the parties expected the contingencies to occur, if at all, within the 21-year period.  The option agreement specifies that the closing date could be scheduled as late as December 31, 2003 and, therefore, the parties manifested their expectation that the contingency might occur and the option might be exercised well beyond December 1999.  Given this contrary intention in the agreement itself, the saving statute is inapplicable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - &quot;Wait and See&quot; Approach The &quot;wait and see&quot; approach to the Rule against Perpetuities (EPTL 9-1.1)--an interest is valid if it actually vests during the perpetuities period, irrespective of what might have happened--is rejected.  The law of New York is settled that the validity of a provision under the Rule against Perpetuities be judged by the circumstances existing at the time of the grant.  Moreover, the language of EPTL 9-1.1 itself that an interest is invalid &quot;unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after one or more lives in being&quot; (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]) precludes a determination of the validity of an interest based upon what actually occurs during the perpetuities period.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perpetuities - Rule against Perpetuities - Availability of Rescission as Remedy for Failed Option to Purchase Where an option to purchase commercial property executed in connection with a sale-partial leaseback of the subject premises fails as violative of the prohibition against remote vesting embodied in the Rule against Perpetuities (EPTL 9-1.1 [b]), the contract of sale will not be rescinded due to the mutual mistake of the parties.  While CPLR 3005 provides that when relief against mistake is sought, it shall not be denied merely because the mistake is one of law rather than fact, that provision removes technical objections in instances where recoveries can otherwise be justified by analogy with mistakes of fact, and here the parties' mistake is nothing more than a misunderstanding as to the applicable law.  Moreover, the remedy of rescission lies in equity and is a matter of discretion; there is an irreconcilable conflict in applying a remedy which is designed to void a transaction because it fails to carry out the parties' true intent to a transaction in which the mistake made by the parties was the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, the purpose of which is to defeat the intent of the parties.  Granting rescission would be contrary to New York's public policy reflected in the Rule against Perpetuities since it would lead to the same result as enforcing the option and tend to compel performance of contracts violative of the Rule.  </SPAN></P>

Doctrinally and as actually practiced in the 12-step methodology that comprises the heart of the A.A. program, adherence to the A.A. fellowship entails engagement in religious activity and religious proselytization.  Followers are urged to accept the existence of God as a Supreme Being, Creator, Father of Light and Spirit of the Universe.  In &quot;working&quot; the 12 steps, participants become actively involved in seeking such a God through prayer, confessing wrongs and asking for removal of shortcomings.  These expressions and practices constitute, as a matter of law, religious exercise for Establishment Clause purposes.  Moreover, even if the governing principles and practices of A.A., as incorporated in the correctional facility's Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (ASAT) Program, do not necessarily require an atheist participant to accept the existence of God in the religious sense, or to engage in religious activity, the mandatory and exclusive incorporation of A.A. doctrine and practices in the ASAT Program violates Establishment Clause principles prohibiting governmental endorsement of religion, and requiring governmental neutrality with respect to religion. </SPAN></P>

State-coerced adherence to a religious sect is not necessary to prove an Establishment Clause violation under any portion of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Lemon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> test.  A &quot;primary&quot; effect of advancing religion does not connote that the religious consequences of the State action must predominate over any secular objective or consequence.  No measurement or weighing of the respective secular and religious effects is required.  A violation is established if the State action's inevitable effect is to aid and advance religion. Moreover, an endorsement of religion violating the Establishment Clause can be determined by examining whether the message that the government's practice communicates may be fairly understood as favoring or promoting religion. That is, it must be ascertained whether the challenged governmental action is sufficiently likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices.  Accordingly, the inclusion of the 12-step methodology that comprises the heart of the Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) program, and A.A.'s other doctrines and meeting practices in a mandated, exclusive drug addiction and alcoholism rehabilitation program at a State correctional facility constitutes the prohibited endorsement of religion violating the Establishment Clause.  It is simply unimaginable that inmates in the inherently authoritarian atmosphere of a prison would not perceive that such a mandatory, exclusive program, facially containing expressions and practices that have always been religious, favors inmates who adhere to those beliefs, and symbolically condones the religious proselytizing those expressions literally reflect.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the trial court's judgment for defendant developers on their counterclaims for an order compelling reinstatement of a building permit and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After developers began working on a site, the building inspector, at the town supervisor's direction, revoked their building permit. Town then sued to compel the removal of a building on the site. On review, the court held that developers were entitled to reinstatement of the permit because they had a vested right in the planned construction, as the permit was legally issued. The record supported the trial court's conclusion that developers had sufficiently committed the land to the use authorized by the permit prior to revocation. Thus, the revocation resulted in an unconstitutional deprivation of developers' property rights. The court thus held that developers stated a cause of action for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the acts of town in revoking developers' permit denied them substantive due process of law. Developers had established a protectable property interest in the building permit. Due process assured them the right to be free from arbitrary municipal actions destructive of this interest. The record supported the conclusion that the building inspector's revocation of the permit was solely for political reasons and thus arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Federal Civil Rights Claim - Deprivation of Vested Right - Legally Issued Building Permit A vested right can be acquired when, pursuant to a legally issued permit, the landowner demonstrates a commitment to the purpose for which the permit was granted by effecting substantial changes and incurring substantial expenses to further the development.  The landowner's actions relying on a valid permit must be so substantial that the municipal action results in serious loss rendering the improvements essentially valueless.  Accordingly, where there is support in the record for the lower courts' factual finding that defendants had sufficiently committed the land to the use authorized by the permit legally issued by plaintiff to defendants to develop the land prior to plaintiff's revocation of the permit, and the permit was revoked for unlawful reasons, the revocation resulted in an unconstitutional deprivation of defendants' property rights.  Accordingly, defendants are entitled to reinstatement of the building permit in conformity with the zoning ordinances in effect at the time of the revocation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Federal Civil Rights Claim - Ripeness for Judicial Review - Determination of Town Building Inspector to Revoke Building Permit A determination of plaintiff Town's Building Inspector revoking defendants' permit to develop real property in the Town is final and, therefore, defendants' counterclaim under 42 USC &sect; 1983 seeking damages on the ground that the Building Inspector's determination was arbitrary and capricious is ripe for judicial review notwithstanding that defendants did not appeal the determination to the Town Zoning Board of Appeals.  With respect to a substantive due process claim involving a land use decision under section 1983 based on arbitrary and capricious conduct, the decision sought to be reviewed must be final, but it is unnecessary that the landowner pursue administrative remedies to determine how the regulation in question applies to the property or avail itself of State procedures for determining compensation.  The finality requirement is concerned with whether an official authorized to make the determination has arrived at a decision that inflicts injury. Here, under the Town's ordinances, the Building Inspector was the &quot;initial decisionmaker&quot; vested by law with the exclusive and unfettered authority to decide the question of revocation and he clearly had done so when he revoked defendants' permit and halted work on the project.  The Zoning Board was not authorized to revoke a permit or even participate in the Inspector's decision to revoke. Its power was restricted to the review of the Inspector's final decision. Thus, a determination by the Board was not necessary and defendants' counterclaim for section 1983 relief is ripe for judicial review. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Rights - Federal Civil Rights Claim - Unlawful Revocation of Building Permit Defendants successfully established a claim for damages pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983 based on plaintiff Town's Building Inspector's arbitrary and irrational revocation of their permit to develop real property in the Town.  To succeed on a claim for damages pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983, defendants were required to establish deprivation of a protectable property interest by one acting under the authority of law.  Due process assures the right to be free from arbitrary or irrational municipal actions destructive of a cognizable property interest. Here, defendants established that the rights to develop their land had become vested under State law, and that they would have received the limited future authorizations necessary to complete the project.  On this evidence, the Town had engendered a clear expectation of continued enjoyment of the permit sufficient to constitute a protectable property interest for purposes of a section 1983 claim.  Further, the evidence in the record supports the trial court's conclusion that the Building Inspector's revocation of defendants' permit was arbitrary and capricious because it was without legal justification and motivated entirely by political concerns.  The Building Inspector's actions may be imputed to the Town, since the Town Zoning Code, which necessarily reflects Town policy, vests the Building Inspector, alone, with the authority to revoke building permits.  The Building Inspector therefore implements Town policy and the Town, by enacting the legislation, accepted the possibility that he would exercise this authority in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages - Inadequate and Excessive Damages - Wrongful Revocation of Development Permit A damages award of $ 5,137,126 to defendants on their counterclaim against plaintiff Town pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983 for the wrongful revocation of defendants' permit to develop real property in the Town will not be overturned as incorrectly computed or excessive.  The parties agreed to a certain formula to measure damages. Implementing that formula, the Town stipulated to values for the building and the land before and after taking, the difference between the two numbers, the equity ratio and the market rate of return.  The court determined other values based upon the evidence and directed the parties to compute the damages using the formula and submit their determination.  It based its final award on those submissions.  Inasmuch as the figures used were either supported by evidence or agreed upon by the parties, there is no basis to interfere with the award.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed a nonfinal order of the trial court in favor of respondent, Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, and against appellant insurance company, which struck the insurance company's answer unless it posted a bond or other security.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company's answer had been stricken because it did not post a preanswer security pursuant to N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 1213(c). The insurance company argued that as applied, &sect; 1213(c) violated the procedural due process guarantees of the Federal Constitution. The court found that N.Y. Ins.

The Insurance Law clearly provides notice that preanswer security will be required if an alien insurer chooses to conduct business in New York without a license. The State's interest in ensuring the availability of funds from which a judgment against a foreign or alien unlicensed insurer may be promptly paid, instead of requiring claimants to resort to far-flung forums for satisfaction of their judgments, justifies striking the answer of a foreign or alien insurer if that insurer fails to provide adequate preanswer security.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent foreign taxpayer filed a declaratory judgment action against appellant Superintendent of the State of New York Insurance Department, alleging that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1505-a was unconstitutional. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted taxpayer's motion. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the judgment. Superintendent sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In New York, foreign insurers were subject to retaliatory taxes, which were designed to retaliate against foreign states with more onerous tax laws than New York. Generally, a tax credit was allowed for New York Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) tax surcharges. However, N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1505-a disallowed an MCTD surcharge credit against retaliatory taxes for foreign insurers. Taxpayer argued that the denial of the credit violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding that &sect; 1505-a was unconstitutional, concluding that the intent to increase or protect revenues at the expense of foreign insurers did not constitute a legitimate purpose sufficient to withstand an equal protection challenge. The court held that &sect; 1505-a resulted in unconstitutional discrimination because it was unsupported by a legitimate governmental purpose. Specifically, &sect; 1505-a did not protect the MCTD fund because taxpayer did not avoid paying the MCTD surcharge simply by receiving a credit; taxpayer was not seeking a refund of the MCTD surcharge but a credit against its retaliatory taxes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District Tax Surcharge - Constitutionality of Denial of Credit against Retaliatory Taxes Tax Law &sect; 1505-a (d) (8), insofar as it denies a credit to foreign insurers for the payment of the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) tax surcharge against retaliatory taxes imposed under Insurance Law &sect; 1112, is unsupported by a legitimate governmental purpose and, therefore, violates the Equal Protection Clause (US Const 14th Amend).  A State tax statute will withstand an equal protection challenge if the classification at issue has a legitimate purpose and is rationally related to achievement of that purpose.  Retaliatory taxation is legitimate precisely because it aims to equalize domestic and foreign taxation. A system of retaliatory taxation, which by definition discriminates between domestic and foreign insurance companies, is constitutionally sound insofar as it aims to equalize the tax burden of domestic and foreign insurers, but the imposition of retaliatory tax beyond the point of equalization solely to generate revenue at the expense of foreign insurers lacks legitimacy.  Here, the only purpose served by disallowing the credit is revenue generation, but since this redounds to the exclusive detriment of foreign insurers, it is illegitimate and will not support the State's retaliation beyond the point of equalization. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the trial court's order dismissing a criminal indictment. After identification of defendant by a witness was suppressed, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.20(1)(b), on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was legally insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a criminal indictment with robbery in the first degree, criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree, and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. After identification of defendant by a witness was suppressed, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.20(1)(b) and (h), on the grounds that the evidence before the grand jury was legally insufficient and that there was a legal impediment to conviction. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, but the appellate decision reversed. On appeal, the court noted that a trial court's function on a motion to dismiss pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.20(1)(b) was limited to an assessment of the legal sufficiency of the evidence at the time of the indictment, not in light of subsequent developments. The court reasoned that suppression of the identification did not negate any elements of the charged crimes and, although the absence of identification might create a difficulty for the prosecution at trial, it did not render it impossible to obtain a conviction against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate division's judgment reversing the dismissal of the indictment, reinstating the indictment, and remitting the case to the trial court for further proceedings on the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Sufficiency of Evidence before Grand Jury - Suppression of Identification of Defendant The indictment of defendant for robbery in the first degree and related crimes arising from the armed holdup of the victim was not rendered legally insufficient </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 210.20 [1] [b]) due to the suppression of the victim's identification of defendant.  In the context of a Grand Jury proceeding, legally sufficient evidence means proof of a prima facie case, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  If competent prima facie evidence underlying an indictment is subsequently rendered inadmissible by extrinsic proof, the legal sufficiency of the indictment is not undermined as the court's function on a motion to dismiss an indictment pursuant to CPL 210.20 (1) (b) is limited to an assessment of the legal sufficiency of the evidence at the time of the indictment, not in light of subsequent events.  The relevant inquiry on a motion to dismiss an indictment pursuant to CPL 210.20 (1) (b) is whether the evidence before the Grand Jury, viewed most favorably to the People, would support a determination of guilt. Here, the victim's positive identification of defendant, together with the arresting officer's testimony, as presented to the Grand Jury, satisfied this threshold standard.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Dismissal Based on Legal Impediment to Conviction - Suppression of Identification Evidence The indictment of defendant for robbery in the first degree and related crimes arising from the armed holdup of the victim need not be dismissed on the ground that the suppression of the victim's identification of defendant constitutes a legal impediment to defendant's conviction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 210.20 [1] [h]).  Suppression of the identification evidence simply diminishes the quantum of proof against defendant but does not negate any elements of the charged crimes.  While the absence of the identification may create difficulty for the prosecution at trial, it certainly does not render it impossible for the People to obtain a conviction against defendant.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contestants appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which modified a supreme court judgment denying a motion by defendant designated beneficiary for judgment notwithstanding the verdict for contestants, and directed the distribution of decedent's retirement benefits, except for certain term insurance, to the designated beneficiary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent, a schoolteacher, died. Under a retirement system for schoolteachers, decedent's designated beneficiary was entitled to receive a lump-sum payment of decedent's accumulated retirement benefits. Based on conversations between the decedent and contestants, the contestants challenged the beneficiary designated in the applicable forms. The jury found for the contestants and the supreme court denied a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The appellate division modified and directed that the designated beneficiary was to receive the retirement benefits, except for certain term insurance. The contestants were not successful on appeal. The court held that conversations between the decedent and the contestants regarding decedent's retirement benefits did not fall within the life insurance proceeds exception to the testimonial bar of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4519, the &quot;Dead Man's Statute.&quot; The court agreed with the appellate division that decedent's schoolteacher retirement benefits were different from the proceeds of typical life insurance policies, because the proceeds belonged to the decedent before his death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate division that modified the supreme court judgment and directed the distribution of decedent's retirement benefits to the designated beneficiary, except for certain term insurance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence - Dead Man's Statute - Oral Communications with Decedent Regarding Distribution of Retirement Benefits Conversations between a decedent and parties contesting rights to decedent's lump-sum retirement benefits, excluding the life insurance component, under the New York City Teachers' Retirement System payable on decedent's death do not fall within the exception to the testimonial bar of the Dead Man's Statute (CPLR 4519) that relates solely to life insurance proceeds.  The proceeds of a life insurance policy never belong to the deceased and do not come into existence until his or her death; accordingly, they are excepted from the evidentiary prohibition of the statute that contemplates property or an interest which belonged to the deceased in his lifetime and the title to which has passed by assignment or otherwise through him to the party who is protected by the section.  Decedent's assets in his vested retirement plan belonged to him during his lifetime and were sufficiently manageable by him in ways that are significantly distinct from the life insurance assets.  Nor did they merely come into existence on his death.  Moreover, the purpose of CPLR 4519 is to protect estates from perjurious claims.  If decedent had not designated any beneficiary, the final payout upon his death would have gone directly to his estate--a feature that is part of the CPLR 4519 protection against postdeath fabrications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial - Verdict - Sufficiency of Evidence - Action to Recover Lump-Sum Retirement Benefits Payable on Decedent's Death In an action seeking recovery of lump-sum retirement benefits payable on decedent's death under a retirement plan, the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's verdict in favor of plaintiffs, individuals named in an alleged beneficiary designation, absent plaintiffs' testimony which is inadmissible pursuant to the Dead Man's Statute (CPLR 4519), since that testimony constituted the only evidence of the content of the alleged beneficiary designation that a notary testified he saw decedent sign and another witness allegedly mailed to the Retirement System. Without the key testimony, the jury would have been left to speculate about what the Retirement System had in fact received.  Since all three copies of the alleged beneficiary designation &quot;disappeared&quot; in various and curious ways, there is no way to ascertain, without resort to the witness testimony, the content of what the decedent allegedly signed.  CPLR 4519 was designed to ward off the dangers and adverse consequences of this very kind of unverifiable development.  </SPAN></P>

XIV required respondents to substantiate reports of child abuse by a fair preponderance of the evidence before they could be disseminated to providers and licensing agencies as a screening device for future employment. The court concluded that the state had impaired the constitutionally protected interest of petitioners in future employment and that respondents' procedures did not protect petitioners from an improper deprivation of that interest.

There is no constitutional prohibition against the State maintaining a list of suspected abusers. Nor is the stigma resulting from petitioners being branded child abusers constitutionally protected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent miner challenged the legality of amendments to the township's zoning ordinance.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Notice of Proposed Amendments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent Town did not violate the public notice provisions of Town Law &sect;&sect; 264 and 265 regarding proposed amendments to a local zoning ordinance when it enacted the two repealer provisions but not the special use permit amendment that were included in the public notice. The public notice required by sections 264 and 265 is notice of the time and place of the hearing in order that the public shall have an opportunity to be heard.  The sufficiency of the notice is tested by whether it fairly apprises the public of the fundamental character of the proposed zoning change.  Here, the notice briefly described the proposed new special permit section of the Zoning Ordinance, advised that copies of the entire text of the proposed amendments were available, and invited submission of written as well as public comment at the hearing.  It clearly advised the public that three separate though related amendments were contemplated, including the repealer provisions subsequently enacted, and there was nothing inaccurate or misleading about it.  That petitioner interpreted the publication as an all-or-nothing proposal, and prepared and directed its comments and objections exclusively to the adoption of the special permit provision and not the repealer provisions, cannot be blamed on any deficiency in the published notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Referral of Proposed Amendments to Planning Board</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Town did not violate the referral requirements of General Municipal Law &sect; 239-m and Sardinia Town Ordinance &sect; 12.01, which require the local municipality to refer proposed zoning amendments to the County Planning Board and the Town Planning Board, respectively, for a report and recommendation, when it referred three proposed amendments to the Planning Boards--two repealer provisions eliminating mining as a permitted use and a special use permit amendment for mining on existing sites--but adopted only the repealer provisions without rereferring the proposed amendments.  The County and Town Planning Boards received notice of the three proposed amendments.  Thus, it cannot be said that the Town failed to refer the matter as required by statute.  Moreover, the Planning Boards were clearly notified that the effect of the amendments, both as proposed and as enacted, was to limit mining operations in the Town to currently existing mining sites. The only functional difference between the amendments as proposed and as enacted related to the legal status of the use of currently operating mine sites, which was of little relevance to traffic, population density, community appearance and facilities, and other matters within the domain and concern of the Planning Boards (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, General Municipal Law &sect; 239-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">l</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">). Accordingly, having referred the proposed amendments to the Planning Boards as required by General Municipal Law &sect; 239-m and Sardinia Zoning Ordinance &sect; 12.01, the action by the Town Board in adopting only the repealer provisions did not render those referrals defective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Mines and Minerals -- Mined Land Reclamation Law -- Preemption of Local Zoning Ordinance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Mined Land Reclamation Law (ECL 23-2701 [MLRL]) does not preempt respondent Town's authority to determine that mining should not be a permitted use of land within the Town, and to enact amendments to the Town's Zoning Ordinance in accordance with that determination.  The supersession provision of the MLRL (ECL 23-2703, as amended) provides that &quot;[f]or the purposes stated herein, this title shall supersede all other state and local laws relating to the extractive mining industry; provided, however, that nothing in this title shall be construed to prevent any local government from ... enacting or enforcing local zoning ordinances or laws which determine permissible uses in zoning districts&quot; (ECL 23-2703 [2] [b]).  The patent purpose of the 1991 amendment of the statute was to withdraw from municipalities the authority to enact local laws imposing land reclamation standards that were stricter than the State-wide standards under the MLRL.  The language of this amended provision accords with the distinction previously recognized in the statute between zoning ordinances, which are not subject to preemption by the MLRL, and local ordinances that regulate mining activities, which are subject to such preemption.  There is nothing in the legislative history of the amendment to the statute suggesting that the Legislature intended the MLRL to go further and limit municipalities' broad authority to govern land use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Exclusionary Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While a municipality may not engage in exclusionary zoning, i.e., improperly using its zoning power to keep people out, a municipality is not obliged to permit the exploitation of any and all natural resources within the town as a permitted use if limiting that use is a reasonable exercise of its police powers to prevent damage to the rights of others and to promote the interests of the community as a whole.  Accordingly, respondent Town properly amended its Zoning Ordinance to eliminate mining as a permitted use, but continue existing mines as lawful nonconforming uses.  On its face, the Town's action in limiting mining activity to nonconforming use status on existing sites was lawful and, even if the test for exclusionary zoning applied to industrial uses, nothing in the record suggests that the Town did, in fact, exclude that use or exercise its police powers to regulate mining for improper purposes.  To the extent the amendments prohibit the development of new mines, there is no vested right to have the existing Zoning Ordinance continue unchanged if the Town Board rationally exercised its police power and determined that a change in the zoning was required for the well-being of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Comprehensive Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Respondent Town's action in amending its Zoning Ordinance to eliminate mining as a permitted use, but continue existing mines as lawful nonconforming uses, is valid inasmuch as it accords with the comprehensive plan manifested in the Town's Zoning Ordinance originally enacted.  The essential purpose of the requirement that rezoning be in accordance with a comprehensive plan is to guard against ad hoc zoning legislation affecting the land of a few without proper regard to the needs or design of the community as a whole.  A municipality may change its Zoning Ordinance, however, to promote the general welfare and to respond to changed conditions in the community.  Here, the original Zoning Ordinance's authorization of mining throughout the Town as a matter of right indicated that the Town in 1969 considered mining to be generally beneficial and consistent with the character and needs of the community.  In 1993, the Town Board considered that some 600 acres of land within the Town were presently being mined and would continue to be mined, and that those operating sites could be expanded to their property boundaries as nonconforming uses.  The record further reveals that in enacting the amendments which prohibit further expansion of mining, the Town Board was responding to legitimate concerns created by its continued growth in the Town and the potential for major portions of the Town's area to be devoted solely to mining operations.  Moreover, the Town removed mining as a permitted use throughout the municipality. Thus, the Board did not act irrationally or engage in ad hoc zoning legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Open Meetings Law -- Propriety of Executive Session of Town Board</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Petitioner's contention that respondent Town Board violated the Open Meetings Law (Public Officers Law &sect; 100 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) by drafting new legislation at an executive session of the Town Board held after a public hearing concerning three proposed amendments to the Town's Zoning Ordinance is without merit where, following the executive session, the Board enacted two of the amendments proposed which were not new or different from the proposed amendments, and it tabled the remaining proposed amendment.  Petitioner has failed to assert any fact controverting the Town's sworn allegation that the executive session was conducted only for a permissible purpose under Public Officers Law &sect; 105 (1) (d)--to obtain legal opinions and advice from the Town's Counsel about the adoption of the proposed amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- SEQRA Challenge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. An owner of property that is the subject of rezoning has a legally cognizable interest in being assured that the town satisfied the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) (ECL art 8) before taking action to rezone its land and, therefore, has standing to challenge the SEQRA review undertaken as part of the zoning enactment without the need to allege the likelihood of environmental harm.  Accordingly, petitioner, the owner of a potential mining site it intends to operate in the future that is affected by amendments to the Town's Zoning Ordinance removing new mining operations from the permitted uses within the Town, has standing to challenge respondents' compliance with SEQRA in connection with the amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Amendment to Zoning Ordinance That Differs from Proposed Amendment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Respondent Town Board's review of the environmental effects of an amendment to the Town's Zoning Ordinance that continued existing mining operations throughout the Town as lawful, but nonconforming uses, was in compliance with the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) notwithstanding that the Full Environmental Assessment Form, which provided the basis for the Town Board's negative declaration and findings, was completed with respect to a proposed amendment that would have rendered mining on existing sites a specially permitted use rather than a nonconforming use. The currently operating mines that became nonconforming uses under the adopted amendments were required to be operating under valid Department of Environmental Conservation permits.  Pursuant to the proposed amendments, the primary requirements of the application to the Town for a special permit were conditions designed merely to provide assurance to the Town that the applicant was in compliance with the requirements of the Mined Land Reclamation Law. Thus, the fact that the special permit provision was not enacted would not have any independent effect upon the environmental considerations raised under SEQRA except that, under the proposed amendments, the Town would be authorized to impose conditions related to ingress and egress to public thoroughfares and the routing of mineral transport vehicles over Town roads.  While such authority is lacking under the present Zoning Ordinance, the Town Board, when completing the Environmental Assessment Form with respect to the special permit amendments, concluded that that amendment to the Zoning Ordinance would have no effect on existing transportation systems in the Town.  Thus, even in that aspect, the special permit amendment was no different from the Ordinance as it now exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Validity of Rapid Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Respondent Town Board's rapid review of the environmental effects of proposed amendments to the Town's Zoning Ordinance eliminating mining as a permitted use, which was completed at a single work session of the full Town Board and resulted in all questions on the Full Environmental Assessment Form being answered in the negative, was not invalid under the State Environmental Quality Review Act on the ground that it was conducted too quickly.  That the Board answered all the questions in the negative, and that it was able to do so quickly, does not establish that its review was inadequate as a matter of law.  The record reflects that the Town Board identified the relevant areas of environmental concern as related to the proposed action, took the requisite &quot;hard look&quot; at them and in its negative declaration set forth a reasoned elaboration of the basis for its determination.  Given the nature of the proposed action here, which would have only beneficial environmental effect, and the focus of the Assessment Form, which is to identify negative environmental effects of the proposed action, the Town Board's rapid review and completion of the Environmental Assessment Form was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a guilty verdict on the depraved mind charge. Defendant argued that the supreme court erred in instructing the jury to &quot;blend&quot; its consideration of the two inconsistent counts by allowing them to consider lesser included charge of manslaughter for each murder count after it considered the major murder counts. The court ruled that this procedure was acceptable because statutory law setting forth these crimes did not dictate the order in which the jury should consider the charges. Moreover, the court noted that the procedure chosen by the supreme court avoided a possible miscarriage of justice by permitting the jury to consider the offenses in the decreasing level of culpability to avoid the possibility of erroneously convicting on a lesser included offense. The court also ruled that &sect; 125.25(2) was not unconstitutionally vague because the language relating to conduct &quot;with a depraved indifference to human life&quot; was well understood.</SPAN></P>

The jury was properly instructed to consider the inconsistent murder counts in the alternative, but was not required to consider the various greater and lesser offenses of each count as a whole.  Nothing in CPL article 300 directs the order in which the jury should consider the various offenses submitted to it.  The jury could permissibly consider the offenses in alternating order during their deliberations. Moreover, such a procedure avoids a possible miscarriage of justice.  If the jury must consider and render a verdict on every offense submitted under the first count before considering any other count, it could find defendant guilty of manslaughter as a lesser included offense under the first count submitted, before reaching the inconsistent offense of depraved mind murder under the second count and, thus, be forced to convict defendant of a lesser crime than his conduct actually warranted.  </SPAN></P>

A plain reading of section 691 (3), which states that &quot;[a] person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under this article, a partner in a firm so liable, a principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable, a person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, and an employee of a person so liable, who materially aids in the act of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">[sic]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transaction constituting the violation, is also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the controlled person, partnership, corporation or employer&quot;, indicates that the qualifying phrase &quot;materially aids&quot; refers to all of the potentially jointly and severally liable defendants--controlling persons, partners, officers, directors, and employees of the franchisor--not only employees of the franchisor. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Single and Separate Ownership Exemption -- Applicability to Environmental Zoning Regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A single and separate ownership exemption contained in a Village zoning ordinance, which provides that nonconforming or substandard property may be exempt from minimum lot or area regulations where its ownership was different from that of any adjoining land on the effective date of the ordinance and is still so owned, relates to area and width, and has no application to an environmental zoning regulation designed to protect property from the effects of floods. Accordingly, respondent owner of an unimproved parcel located in a flood plain area who purchased the parcel prior to enactment by the Village of &quot;Resource Protection&quot; regulations that limited development and restricted new construction on environmentally sensitive areas, including flood plains, is not entitled under the Village ordinance's single and separate ownership exemption to a building permit for construction of a residence on the parcel that is otherwise prohibited by the &quot;Resource Protection&quot; regulations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Common-Law Single and Separate Ownership Exemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is no need for a common-law rule to protect landowners who possess parcels in &quot;single and separate ownership&quot; situations.  A municipality may in the reasonable exercise of its police powers change its zoning to control land use and development.  A municipality that chooses to make such changes may, but need not, exempt existing owners of substandard lots from the changes' more onerous effects.  As one of several ways to accomplish this, a municipality may provide through its ordinance for exemptions for property that is held in single and separate ownership. In the usual case, such exemptions are self-executing and no application to the local Zoning Board of Appeals is necessary.  In contrast, where the municipality has not created an exemption as a matter of legislative grace, the property owner can ordinarily utilize the local provisions for obtaining a variance. Failing that, an owner who perceives himself or herself aggrieved can bring a judicial proceeding alleging an unconstitutional taking or some governmental arbitrariness in the denial of a variance. Since the owner's constitutional rights are amply protected by the availability of such proceedings, there is no legal basis for overriding the municipality's legislative choice by creating a separate common-law right that would automatically exempt property owners from area restrictions without an individualized assessment of hardship. </SPAN></P>

Respondent zoning board denied the permit because the total area of appellants' lot exceeded &sect; 105-39's minimum, notwithstanding that the lot was rendered substandard by subsequently enacted minimum frontage and width restrictions. The trial court annulled respondent's denial of the permit, but the appellate court reversed. On further appeal, the court reversed, finding respondent's interpretation too restrictive because it arbitrarily undermined the exemption clause's purpose and it would unconstitutionally deprive property owners of their land's value when their lots were rendered substandard as to width or frontage by a zoning ordinance. The court also held respondent's interpretation improper because it violated the rule on construing zoning ordinances, which resolved ambiguities in language in favor of property owners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Zoning - Construction of Single and Separate Ownership Exemption Respondent Zoning Board of Appeals' (ZBA) construction of the single and separate ownership exemption of section 105-154 of the Code of the Village of Farmingdale, which provides for the relief of lots which became substandard as a result of the subsequent adoption of zoning restrictions, as applying only to lots substandard in total square footage area, not as to width and frontage, is unsupportable. Under the canon of construction that a term of greater comprehension includes a lesser term, the reference to a &quot;plot smaller in area&quot; in the exemption, rather than specifying an exemption based solely in terms of square feet, should be interpreted as subsuming all of the dimensional restrictions (frontage, width and square footage) included in the term &quot;Lot area&quot; set forth in the Village Code.  Further, the ZBA's confined interpretation undermines the ameliorative purpose of the single and separate ownership exemption--to protect long-term property owners from amendments that render useless their previously conforming property--and gives rise to arbitrary and inconsistent applications of it.  Moreover, the ZBA's interpretation of the term &quot;area&quot; violates the rule of construction for zoning ordinances that any ambiguity in the language used must be resolved in favor of the property owner. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, mortgage corporation, brought a declaratory judgment action in federal district court against defendant, New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), seeking a ruling as to whether, upon dissolution of a cooperative corporation, the units were subject to rent regulation. On appeal from a ruling in favor of the DHCR, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified the question to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that the Division of Housing and Community Renewal's regulation limiting the exemption for cooperatives for only so long as that type of ownership was maintained impermissibly restricted what the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL), New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 26-501 et seq., designed to be a permanent exemption for cooperatively owned units. The court found that because the RSL provided in clear terms that a building otherwise eligible for rent stabilization was exempt from such regulation if owned as a cooperative, it followed that as soon as a multiple dwelling was no longer owned as a cooperative, the RSL and Rent Stabilization Code (Code) again become applicable to it. The renewed application of the RSL did not violate the Constitution's prohibitions against physical takings because the plaintiff bought the building with knowledge that it was occupied and to be operated as a rental accommodation, and the RSL and Code provisions gave clear notice that upon loss of cooperative status the building would be subject to rent regulation. No new use of the property had been forced upon plaintiff, and no unconstitutional physical taking had been effectuated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Reversion of Cooperative to Rent-Regulated Status upon Foreclosure A multiple dwelling exempt from the Rent Stabilization Law by virtue of its cooperative ownership reverts to its former rent-regulated status upon foreclosure and the return of the building to operation as rental housing. By its terms, the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL) applies to &quot;Class A multiple dwellings not owned as a cooperative&quot; (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-504).  The Rent Stabilization Code provides that its protections apply to all housing accommodations regulated under the RSL except housing accommodations contained in buildings owned as cooperatives &quot;for so long as they maintain [cooperative] status&quot; (9 NYCRR 2520.11&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">[l]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A dissolved cooperative is not a cooperative and thus is not entitled to an exemption under the RSL.  The RSL and the regulation are uniform in effect--the building is exempt for &quot;so long as&quot; it maintains cooperative status--and the Division of Housing and Community Renewal has not exceeded its rule-making authority in promulgating the regulation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Physical Taking - Reversion of Cooperative to Rent-Regulated Status upon Foreclosure The reversion of units of a cooperative to regulated rent upon foreclosure does not effect an unconstitutional physical taking on the ground that it forces the owner to accept rent-regulated tenants. Inasmuch as the owner is not being forced to use the property in a new manner, no unconstitutional physical taking has been effectuated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Regulatory Taking - Reversion of Cooperative to Rent-Regulated Status upon Foreclosure The reversion of units of a cooperative to regulated rent upon foreclosure does not effect an unconstitutional regulatory taking on the ground that no legitimate State interest is substantially served by granting the protections of the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL) to former proprietary lessees of a failed cooperative corporation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2520.11&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">[l]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RSL and the Code do not purport to give former shareholders of failed cooperative corporations special treatment.  Regardless of prior status, upon foreclosure the building is simply treated in the same manner as other New York City housing accommodations that are regulated under the RSL and former proprietary lessees become renters in a market that is plagued by a housing emergency.  They are given no further protections than other similarly situated tenants threatened with the loss of their homes, and the same legitimate State interests served by application of the RSL in a housing shortage--preventing eviction and resulting vulnerability to homelessness of the identified beneficiaries--are advanced.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Due Process of Law - Reversion of Cooperative to Rent-Regulated Status upon Foreclosure Inasmuch as the Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 26-504) and the Rent Stabilization Code (9 NYCRR 2520.11&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">[l]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have plain and uniform application to a cooperative upon foreclosure, the law is not unconstitutionally vague, notwithstanding the absence of an express provision detailing the method for setting the initial rent after foreclosure. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the state constitution mandated that a bill passed by both houses of the legislature should have been presented to the governor. The relevant bill was never presented to the governor before completion of the legislative session. The appellate division held that the issue was a matter for the legislature but the state constitution did not require presentment to the governor nor require a timetable for presentment. The lobbyists and others argued that the practice of retaining passed bills effectively blocked executive action in approving or vetoing them, thus the presentment clause was violated. The court agreed. The court expressly rejected the state legislative officials' argument that the phrase &quot;before it becomes a law&quot; contained in the presentment clause was conditional, discretionary, or vested in the legislature full and unreviewable power over a bill until the time it chose to present legislature to the governor. The court did find that a retroactive ruing in the case was not warranted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, upon certification of questions from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, considered the question of whether a pay-when-paid provision in a subcontract, which transferred the risk of an owner's default from a general contractor to a subcontractor, violated state public policy as set forth in the Lien Law. Defendant contractor stopped payments to plaintiff subcontractor when the owner became bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subcontractor filed suit in federal district court against defendants, contractor and insurance company. Defendant contractor refused to pay plaintiff for construction work because the owner of the property had declared bankruptcy and had failed to pay defendant contractor. Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the subcontract contained a pay-when paid provision which limited defendant contractor's liability to the sums it received from the owner. Plaintiff cross-moved for summary judgment, arguing that the pay-when-paid provision resulted in a waiver of its ability to enforce the mechanics' lien. The trial court found for plaintiff, and the federal appellate court certified the question to the court of whether a pay-when-paid provision violated state public policy as set forth in the Lien Law. Upon certification, the court held that a pay-when-paid provision which forced the subcontractor to assume the risk that the owner failed to pay the general contractor was void and unenforceable as contrary to public policy as set forth in N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 34. The pay-when-paid provision extinguished plaintiff's ability to enforce his lien against the owner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liens - Mechanic's Lien - Pay-When-Paid Provision as Condition Precedent Void A pay-when-paid provision in a subcontract, which transfers the risk of an owner's default from a general contractor to a subcontractor, violates New York public policy as set forth in the Lien Law. The Lien Law provides that article 2, which governs mechanics' liens, &quot;is to be construed liberally to secure the beneficial interests and purposes thereof&quot; (Lien Law &sect; 23).  The Lien Law also provides, &quot;[n]otwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any contract, agreement or understanding whereby the right to file or enforce any lien created under article two is waived, shall be void as against public policy and wholly unenforceable&quot; (Lien Law &sect; 34).  As a matter of contract law, the owner and the general contractor are liable to plaintiff for the work plaintiff has been authorized to perform, and performed, under the subcontract agreement.  However, a pay-when-paid provision as a condition precedent requires plaintiff to defer payment for its work until the general contractor has been paid by the owner.  The waiver of the right to enforce mechanics' liens occurs by operation of the pay-when-paid provision because mechanics' liens may not be enforced until a debt becomes due and payable, and the pay-when-paid provision as a condition precedent prevents the subcontractor from establishing the existence of a present amount, due and unpaid, arising from the subcontractor's performance and owed by the general contractor. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judge was charged with judicial misconduct stemming from her conversations and financial dealings with a third party who was engaged in drug-dealing and money-laundering schemes. The judge also failed to report a cash gift from that party. Instead of answering the complaint against her, judge resigned. The commission thereafter found that judge should have been removed from her position based on her conduct. Judge appealed on the ground that the commission could only remove judges who were sitting at the time penalty was imposed, thereby rendering N.Y. Jud.

The evidence was also sufficient against judge where it was deemed admitted and advising a known lawbreaker on preserving the fruits of his crime and furnishing a hiding place therefor were acts antithetical to judge's duty to uphold the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges - Removal from Office - Validity of Statute Conferring Jurisdiction to Remove Resigned Judge Judiciary Law &sect; 47, which grants the Commission on Judicial Conduct and the Court of Appeals jurisdiction to remove a resigned Judge for 120 days from the date of resignation, is not rendered unconstitutional on the ground that NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 22's grant of authority to the Commission on Judicial Conduct to remove &quot;judges&quot; applies only to those sitting at the time the penalty is imposed.  The constitutional grant of authority to the Commission to discipline and remove &quot;judges&quot; necessarily and logically covers all acts of misconduct undertaken by a Judge while serving in office.  The fact that a particular Judge may no longer hold that office at the time removal is sought or recommended by the Commission, due to the Judge's postmisconduct resignation, does not preclude the Commission or the Court of Appeals from exercising their respective disciplinary powers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges - Removal from Office Petitioner, a Civil Court Judge who, prior to resigning from office, engaged in serious judicial misconduct based upon statements to and financial dealings with a third party who was engaged in drug-dealing and money-laundering schemes, and her failure to report a $ 1,500 cash gift from that party, is removed from office.  As a member of this State's judiciary governed by exacting standards of honor and propriety, petitioner was obligated to conduct herself at all times in a manner that reflected her own personal respect for the letter and spirit of the law.  Advising a known lawbreaker on preserving the fruits of his crime and furnishing a hiding place for those fruits are acts that are antithetical to that obligation.  Similarly, accepting a cash gift for participating in the wrongdoer's concealment efforts and agreeing to mislead law enforcement authorities is behavior that borders on criminal conduct and is certainly inconsistent with a Judge's pledge to uphold the law.  A Judge who places herself and her associates above the law in this manner prejudices the administration of justice or at least creates an appearance of impropriety by her actions.  That petitioner's misconduct occurred in her home where she may have had an expectation of privacy and that her statements were made to a person she considered to be a close associate do not mitigate the wrongfulness of her conduct.  Judges are accountable at all times for their conduct--including their conversation--both on and off the Bench (Code of Judicial Conduct, canon 2 [A]).  Further, no family, social or other relationships shall carry influence over the Judge's judicial conduct or judgment (Rules of Chief Administrator of Courts [22 NYCRR] &sect; 100.2 [b]).  </SPAN></P>

The county court affirmed an order of the justice court declaring N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped while driving and was charged with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 511(2)(a). He had prior convictions of driving while intoxicated and driving while ability impaired. As a result, his license had been revoked under the recidivist statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1193(2)(b)(3), for a minimum of one year. Defendant had not applied for reinstatement of his license. The lower courts agreed with defendant that &sect; 1193(2)(b)(3) was unconstitutionally vague in that it failed to inform violators that a new application was required to have a revoked license reinstated. On the state's appeal, the court reversed. It reasoned that the word &quot;revoke&quot; was commonly understood to have an element of permanence. Any possible doubt as to the meaning of the word as used in &sect; 1193(2)(b)(3) was laid to rest by the immediately following paragraph, which gave defendant reason to know that upon revocation, a new license application was required. Furthermore, each person whose license was revoked due to alcohol-related offenses was sent written notice that it was necessary to apply for a new license.</SPAN></P>

A presumption of constitutionality attaches to enactments of a coequal branch of government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commissioner of the Franklin County Department of Social Services challenged orders from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which upheld judgments of the family court and ruled that respondent unwed fathers could not be responsible under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 366 or Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 514 for the birth-related expenses incurred by the department on behalf of the child and mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner sought to hold unwed fathers in two cases liable for the birth-related medical expenses incurred by the department on behalf of the mothers and children. The lower courts had determined that since the fathers were eligible for Medicaid at the time of the births and, thus, unable to pay at that time, they were not liable under either N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 366 for the expenses related to the children or Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 514 for the expenses related to the mothers. On appeal, the court ruled that the lower court correctly determined that, under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 366, the proper test for determining liability for a child's birth expenses was ability to pay at the time the expenses were incurred. Thus, the fathers were not liable for such expenses. The court found, however, that the lower court erred in determining that the same test applied to liability for the mother's expenses. The court found that no statute required that result. Thus, the court ruled that under Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 545, a father's present ability to pay was the proper test for liability. The court ruled that such rule had a rational basis and, as such, did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the orders from the appellate division and, as modified, affirmed. The court ruled that unwed fathers could be held responsible for the mother's expenses incurred during delivery based upon the father's ability to pay at the time of the action, not the birth, and remitted to the family court to determine the fathers' present ability to pay for the mother's birth-related expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services - Medical Assistance - Liability of Unwed Father for Birth-Related Medical Expenses - Present Ability to Pay Standard An unwed father's liability for birth-related medical expenses incurred by a County Department of Social Services on behalf of the mother should be determined under a present ability to pay standard.  Under the Federal Medicaid program an unwed father is liable, as a &quot;responsible relative&quot;, for reimbursement of the child's birth expenses under the standard set forth in Social Services Law &sect; 366--the ability to pay at the time the birth-related expenses occurred, as evidenced by his Medicaid eligibility status.  However, the unwed father is not a &quot;responsible relative&quot; of the mother; his liability for the mother's expenses is neither premised on, nor forbidden by, section 366, but rests on the basis of third-party liability under the Federal Medicaid statutory scheme. The statutory basis for the unwed father's third-party liability for the mother's birth-related expenses is found in Family Court Act &sect;&sect; 514 and 545.  Section 545 unambiguously focuses on the unwed father's present ability to pay, as measured by his current resources and his earning capacity.  Moreover, while section 514 states that the court may order an unwed father to pay for the mother's confinement costs in its discretion, it is clear that the court's discretion is to be exercised consistently with the present means and ability standard of section 545.  Thus, in light of the clear mandate in Family Court Act article 5 to measure the unwed father's third-party liability under a present means and ability standard, and because neither the Federal Medicaid program nor Social Services Law &sect; 366 requires application of a different standard, there is no statutory basis for making the unwed father's liability for the mother's birth-related expenses dependent on his ability to pay at the time the expenses were incurred.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Liability of Either Parent for Birth-Related Expenses of Child Born out of Wedlock Family Court Act &sect; 514, while phrased to impose potential liability for a mother's birth-related expenses only on fathers, is properly understood as authorizing the court to impose liability without regard to gender when read in connection with subsequently enacted Family Court Act &sect; 545 which imposes liability for these costs on either parent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Liability of Unwed Fathers for Birth-Related Expenses - Rational Basis Scrutiny Family Court Act &sect;&sect; 514 and 545 do not discriminate on the basis of gender in the context of an unwed father's liability for the birth-related expenses of the mother on the ground that as a matter of law the mother is protected against recoupment under the applicable Medicaid provisions for her own birth expenses </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 369 [2] [b]; 42 USC &sect; 1396a [a] [18]; &sect; 1396p [b]), while the father, even if in the same financial position as the mother at the time of the birth, may be held liable for these same expenses under the Family Court Act; therefore, the difference in treatment of fathers and mothers is subject only to rational basis scrutiny.  The mother is eligible for Medicaid assistance in connection with her pregnancy and birth-related costs as a direct recipient based on her medical condition of pregnancy, and under the applicable Medicaid provisions, a recipient is protected against liability for Medicaid benefits that were lawfully paid.  Thus, the mother's condition of pregnancy provides the basis for her eligibility for benefits and at the same time, provides the basis for her immunity from recoupment. The unwed father, because he is not pregnant and does not give birth, is not a direct recipient of any medical assistance in connection with his child's birth and, thus, he is not protected by the statutory provisions that prohibit recoupment from direct recipients. Accordingly, rather than gender, it is the physical condition of pregnancy that distinguishes the unwed mother and father's statutory liability for the mother's birth-related expenses.  Absent a showing that distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other, a classification based on pregnancy does not constitute a gender-based classification, and there is no evidence here that the pregnancy-based distinction in the statutes was pretextual.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Liability of Unwed Fathers for Birth-Related Expenses - Rational Basis for Distinction between Unwed Fathers and Unwed Mothers For purposes of recoupment of an unwed mother's birth-related expenses incurred by a County Department of Social Services, there is a rational basis for the distinction between unwed fathers, against whom third-party liability is imposed for such expenses pursuant to Family Court Act &sect;&sect; 514 and 545, and unwed mothers, who are immune from recoupment. The difference in treatment of fathers and mothers rests on the physical status of pregnancy. The imposition of third-party liability on unwed fathers in this context furthers the congressional policies underlying the Medicaid program.  Additionally, the Legislature could rationally determine that imposing the threat of future liability on a medically indigent pregnant woman might discourage her from obtaining medical care necessary for the health and survival of both herself and the child, a consideration not applicable to the liability of the unwed father. Because they are, thus, rationally related to a physical distinction--pregnancy--the imposition of different standards of liability with respect to medically indigent expectant mothers and fathers is not unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Equal Protection of Laws - Liability of Unwed Fathers for Birth-Related Expenses - Rational Basis for Distinction between Unwed Fathers and Married Fathers Applying the present ability to pay standard of Family Court Act &sect;&sect; 514 and 545 to determine the liability of an unwed father for the mother's birth-related expenses does not result in an unconstitutional differentiation among fathers on the basis of marital status because a married father who is indigent at the time of his child's birth will permanently escape liability for his spouse's confinement and birth-related costs as a &quot;responsible relative&quot; under Social Services Law &sect; 366, which looks solely to his ability to pay at the time the expenses were incurred, while an unwed father who was indigent at the time of the birth would not necessarily escape liability as a responsible third party under Family Court Act &sect;&sect; 514 and 545, since those provisions look to his ability to pay at the time of the support hearing.  The distinction between married and unmarried fathers with respect to the mother's birth-related expenses is rationally based.  Pursuant to his statutorily imposed spousal support obligations, a married father has an ongoing duty of support to his wife, including liability for her confinement costs and any other necessary medical expenses (Family Ct Act &sect;&sect; 412, 416).  An unmarried father is liable only for the mother's pregnancy and birth-related expenses since it is the child that provides the only legal connection between the two unwed parents.  The far more limited liability of the unwed father for the mother's needs justifies the more favorable treatment of the married father regarding the mother's birth expenses.  Moreover, a married father, indigent at the time of birth, is exempt from any future liability for his wife's or child's birth-related expenses to avoid the destructive effect of future liability on the relationships within the family unit.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Judicial Department (New York), which reinstated an indictment charging defendants with fraud in the sale of securities under N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 352-c(6) and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.65.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with fraud in the sale of securities. The trial court dismissed the indictment as duplicitous and held that the evidence was insufficient to show criminal responsibility. It also held that the sale of numismatic coins did not constitute the sale of securities. The appellate court reinstated the indictment and ruled that there was prima facie evidence that the sale of numismatic coin portfolios constituted the sale of securities. On appeal, the court held that the indictment was not invalid for facial duplicity. Since N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.65(1)(a) provided that one act or multiple acts could constitute a scheme to defraud, defendants could be convicted if there was found a single scheme in which each one participated.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Scheme to Defraud - Sales of Financial Plans to Investors - Duplicitous Count of Indictment The count of an indictment charging defendants with scheme to defraud in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 190.65) arising out of the investment promotional activities of defendant corporation, its officers and sales personnel is not invalid for facial duplicity in that it charges in a single count the commission of more than one offense.  Where a crime by its nature as defined in the Penal Law may be committed either by one act or by multiple acts and can be characterized as a continuing offense over time, the indictment may charge the continuing offense in a single count. Scheme to defraud in the first degree can by its very nature be committed by multiple acts and permits, if not requires, characterization as a continuing offense committed over time.  Thus, a person is guilty of a scheme to defraud when &quot;he [or she] ... engages in a scheme constituting a systematic ongoing course of conduct with intent to defraud ten or more persons or to obtain property from ten or more persons by false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, and so obtains property from one or more of such persons&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 190.65 [1] [a]).  However, to avoid the danger that defendants may be convicted on that count with leas than a unanimous verdict, the trial jury in this case should be instructed that they must all agree upon the existence of the same single scheme to defraud and must also be unanimous as to each defendant found guilty that he or she participated in that same over-all scheme alleged in the indictment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Indictment - Sufficiency of Evidence - Scheme to Defraud - Sales of Financial Plans to Investors Despite the presence of some diversity of criminal actors, modalities and victims, the evidence may support the existence of a single, unitary over-all scheme to defraud. Accordingly, the evidence before the Grand Jury was prima facie sufficient to permit the Grand Jury reasonably to infer the existence of a unitary scheme to defraud arising out of the investment promotional activities of defendant corporation, its officers and sales personnel in connection with investments in numismatic coin portfolios, art portfolios and condominiums. The proof disclosed, and the indictment alleged, common techniques, misrepresentations and omissions of material facts employed in all transactions.  Further, defendant corporation played a pivotal role in all of the transactions, as a constant nucleus through whom the contacts with all investors were initiated and maintained.  Thus, the claim of the defendants involved with numismatic coins of unawareness of and the absence of any participation in defendant corporation's promotions of investments in artworks and condominiums is unavailing to negate the existence of a single over-all scheme to defraud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraud - Martin Act - Fraud in Sale of Securities - Numismatic Coins as &quot;Securities&quot; In a prosecution arising out of the investment promotional activities of certain defendants with respect to numismatic coin portfolios, the Grand Jury could find that the sale of numismatic coin portfolios constituted the sale of securities so as to support the validity of the counts of the indictment charging those defendants under the Martin Act (General Business Law art 23-A) with fraud in the sale of securities (General Business Law &sect; 352-c [6]).  In criminal prosecutions under the Martin Act, investment contracts are &quot;other securities&quot; within the Act's definition of &quot;securities&quot;.  (General Business Law &sect; 352-c [1].) An investment contract means a contract, transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. It is immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise.  Here, there was an investment of money, as defendant corporation's clients were induced to purchase numismatic coin portfolios for the purpose and in the expectation of making a profit from ultimate resale. That investment was in a common enterprise; it is not required that the investor acquires a share in a common fund.  Moreover, there was evidence before the Grand Jury that the profits were expected to be derived solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. Defendants' representations assured investors that a critically important guarantee of the profitability of the numismatic coin portfolio investments was the expertise of the dealers in selecting the coins to be purchased, monitoring their value in a fluctuating market, aiding in making resale decisions and providing assistance with resales. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Vagueness of Martin Act - Numismatic Coins as &quot;Securities&quot; In the prosecution of defendants under the Martin Act (General Business Law art 23-A) arising out of investment promotional activities involving, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> numismatic coin portfolios, construction of General Business Law &sect; 352-c (6), which provides for the imposition of criminal liability upon a person who intentionally engages in fraud while engaged in inducing or promoting the sale of &quot;securities&quot;, to include the sale of numismatic coins as a sale of &quot;other securities&quot; within the statute's definition of &quot;securities&quot; does not render the statute unconstitutionally vague.  The &quot;void for vagueness&quot; doctrine requires that a penal statute provide the ordinary citizen with adequate notice of the exact conduct prohibited, while at the same time affording law enforcement officials some objective standard to avoid the possibility that the law will be arbitrarily enforced.  Of these dual purposes of the doctrine, the provision of minimal guidelines to discourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement is the more important objective.  The doctrine, however, recognizes that some forms of conduct which a State may validly make subject to penal sanctions cannot, and need not, be defined with precision.  The vagueness doctrine does not adjudge the language of a criminal statute in the abstract, but rather in the animating context of well-defined usage and court construction which determines its meaning.  Here, prior judicial construction of &quot;other securities&quot; was amply sufficient to meet the requirements of the void for vagueness doctrine in enforcing the Martin Act by providing adequate notice to the public, and objective standards for law enforcement officials.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, appellant proposed adoptive parents sought review of the decisions of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Courts in the Second and Fourth Judicial Department, which affirmed the family courts' dismissal of appellants' petitions for adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant proposed adoptive parents petitioned the family courts to adopt. One appellant petitioned to adopt his girlfriend's son with permission of the biological father, while other appellant petitioned to adopt the child of her lesbian partner. The appellate courts affirmed the denial of the petitions by the family courts. The court reversed both decisions, finding that appellants had standing under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;110, which allowed unmarried adult persons to adopt, and citing laws and regulations that supported adoption rights of separated married adults and homosexuals. Language in &sect; 110 referring to married couples &quot;together&quot; was intended to ensure that married couples mutually agreed to adopt. The lesbian appellant could adopt her partner's child because N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;117 would not have severed the natural mother's ties, and was not applicable for purposes of standing. Section 117 was intended to protect the property interests of the adopted child. The court noted that other statutes specifically dealt with termination of rights, and cited examples where severance was not required, as with stepparent adoptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of appellant proposed adoptive parents petitions because unmarried adult persons were statutorily allowed to adopt, and the lesbian appellant could adopt her partner's child because the law cited by the lower courts would not have severed the relationship of the biological mother from the child.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Who May Adopt -- Unmarried Partner of Child's Biological Mother</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An unmarried partner of a child's biological mother, whether heterosexual or homosexual, who is raising the child together with the biological parent, has standing to adopt under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 110, which provides that an &quot;adult unmarried person or an adult husband and his adult wife together may adopt another person.&quot; The statute uses the word &quot;together&quot; only to describe married persons and thus does not preclude an unmarried person in a relationship with another unmarried person from adopting.  Further, the pattern of amendments to the statute since the end of World War II evidences a successive expansion of the categories of persons entitled to adopt regardless of their marital status or sexual orientation. Thus, a reading of section 110 granting unmarried second parents standing to adopt is consistent with the words of the statute as well as the spirit behind the modern-day amendments to the statute: encouraging the adoption of as many children as possible regardless of the sexual orientation or marital status of the individuals seeking to adopt them.  </SPAN></P>

The Legislature's chief concern in section 117 was the resolution of property disputes upon the death of an adoptive parent or child, not the standing of an individual to adopt.  Further, section 117 does not invariably require termination in the situation where the biological parent, having consented to the adoption, has agreed to retain parental rights and to raise the child together with the second parent, viz., stepparent adoptions, adoptions by minor fathers and open adoptions.  Given that section 117 is open to two differing interpretations as to whether it automatically terminates parental rights in all cases, a construction of the section that would deny children the opportunity of having their two de facto parents become their legal parents, based solely on their biological mother's sexual orientation or marital status, would not only be unjust under the circumstances, but also might raise constitutional concerns in light of the adoption statute's historically consistent purpose--the best interests of the child.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 240.30(2) after a jury found that he had made repeated threatening and harassing phone calls to a complainant with no purpose of legitimate communication. The judgment was affirmed upon appeal despite defendant's arguments to the contrary for the following reasons: First, because &sect; 240.30(2) proscribed only conduct and expressly removed from its application legitimate communication, defendant could not invoke U.S. Const. amend. I or N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 to support a challenge to the facial validity of the statute. In addition, the court found that the statute was not overbroad because it did not infringe protected rights of defendant or chill the exercise of free speech rights by others. Second, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the court found it to have adequately described elements of the proscribed conduct and to have provided sufficient notice to potential offenders. Finally, the accusatory instrument was not defective for lack of specificity just because it alleged that the offense occurred over a significant period of time, because the statute was amenable to characterization as a continuing crime.</SPAN></P>

The phrase &quot;no legitimate purpose of communication&quot;, notwithstanding its subjective quality, would be understood to mean the absence of expression of ideas or thoughts other than threats and/or intimidating or coercive utterances.  Moreover, by including a specific intent element in the statute, the Legislature has removed the possibility that a defendant could be unaware of his criminal conduct. This specific intent element also removes the possibility that criminal liability would be imposed based on the unascertainable sensitivities of the victim.  Further, there is no possibility of arbitrary enforcement.  The combination of the described standards and the clear and understandable elements of the criminal conduct adequately defines the criminal conduct for the police officers, Judges and juries who will enforce the statute.  Because of the very nature of the conduct proscribed by Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (2), enforcement of the statute is unlikely to occur in the absence of a victim's complaint to authorities and, given the opportunity to consider the veracity of the complainant and to engage in preliminary investigation, this statute vests no more discretion in the police than any other statute which proscribes malevolence or misconduct toward another person.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Information -- Continuing Crime -- Aggravated Harassment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [2]) may be characterized as a continuing crime and, therefore, an information charging defendant with one count of aggravated harassment in the second degree, which alleges that defendant &quot;on or about and between December 12, 1990 &amp; May 20, 1991 ... with the intent to harass, annoy, threaten and alarm [the victim], did make a series of telephone calls to [her] with no purpose of legitimate communication&quot;, is not defective for lack of specificity because it did not identify the particular dates on which defendant was alleged to have made harassing telephone calls.  When a crime may be committed by multiple acts over time and is amenable to characterization as a &quot;continuing crime&quot;, the count in the charging instrument may properly allege that the single offense was committed over a significant period of time. A continuing crime is one that by its nature may be committed either by one act or by multiple acts and readily permits characterization as a continuing offense over a period of time. By its terms, Penal Law &sect; 240.30 (2) imposes criminal liability for making a single telephone call, if placed with the requisite intent and lack of legitimate purpose. While a defendant may annoy, harass, or, more likely, threaten or alarm another person with a single telephone call, the statute does not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">necessarily</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contemplate a single act.  Further, the Legislature intended to proscribe repeated telephone calls to a residence that might drive a person to distraction.  Thus, despite the statutory reference to a single phone call, the provision and its history readily permit characterization as a continuing offense over time.  </SPAN></P>

Although defense counsel successfully obtained a pretrial ruling that the victim could not testify about defendant's condition or medication unless defendant opened the door to such testimony, defense counsel affirmatively injected the issue of defendant's mental illness into the trial during her opening statement, and thereafter raised no relevant objection to the victim's testimony.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner telephone corporation challenged a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which confirmed two determinations of respondent utility commission that imputed revenues to the telephone corporation creating a rebuttable presumption that a two percent royalty would be imputed for rate-making purposes, denied all petitions for rehearing, and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility commission reduced the permissible utility rate the telephone corporation could charge its ratepayers by imputing revenue to it in the form of a two percent royalty arising out of improper cost-shifting and uncompensated transfers of it's intangible assets between it and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The telephone corporation sought to exploit such intangible assets as its name and reputation by closely associating itself with its affiliates in various advertising campaigns. On review, the court affirmed, concluding that the royalty and the rebuttable presumption of a royalty in the future were rational means for achieving just and reasonable utility rates. The court found that: 1) a justiciable controversy existed; 2) the telephone corporation benefitted from the use of a non-rate-based asset paid for by the ratepayers and, as such, the utility commission could allocate part of the cost borne by the ratepayers to the shareholders; 3) the issue of whether the royalty presumption was an unconstitutional taking under the Commerce Clause was not justiciable; and 4) the actions by the utility commission did not impose an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Justiciable Questions An appeal to the Court of Appeals from a judgment of the Appellate Division in a CPLR article 78 proceeding confirming determinations of respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) which reduced the permissible rate petitioner utility could charge its ratepayers by imputing revenue to the utility in the form of a 2% royalty arising out of improper cost-shifting and uncompensated transfers of intangible assets between the utility and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and created a rebuttable presumption of a 2% royalty in the future for other regulated utilities, should not be dismissed as nonjusticiable with respect to petitioner because a Joint Stipulation between the parties fixed the rates petitioner could charge its customers through the year 2001, regardless of the outcome of the appeal, or, with respect to intervenor utilities, because no utility except for petitioner had been ordered to pay a royalty. Even if some aspects of a controversy have become nonjusticiable through a change in conditions, review is still appropriate if substantial questions remain on which an effective disposition can be made.  Here, although the Joint Stipulation resolved the propriety of PSC's application of the 2% royalty to petitioner's case through December 31, 2001, a justiciable controversy exists as to PSC's general authority to order payment of a 2% royalty based upon a utility's relationship with its subsidiaries and affiliates. An article 78 proceeding is the proper avenue to obtain review of a PSC ruling allegedly beyond its authority.  Further, given PSC's refusal to entertain further general challenges in individual rate cases, appellants have no other forum in which to challenge the authority of the PSC to impute a 2% royalty and impose the rebuttable presumption. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Validity of Public Service Commission's Imputation of 2% Royalty Payment with Respect to Utility's Investment in Unregulated Operations - Uncompensated Use of Utility's Name and Reputation The regulated value assurance mechanism (RVAM) component of a 2% royalty imposed by respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) on petitioner utility, which was designed to compensate ratepayers for the imprudent, uncompensated transfers of petitioner's intangible assets, such as its name and reputation, between petitioner and its subsidiaries and affiliates has a rational basis and is supported by the record.  The record contains support for PSC's conclusion that petitioner's name and reputation have value, which petitioner sought to exploit by closely associating itself with its affiliates in various advertising campaigns, and petitioner's unregulated subsidiaries and affiliates did not pay for the use of petitioner's logo and name.  Where a utility derives benefit from the use of a non-rate-based asset paid for by the ratepayers, the PSC may allocate part of the cost borne by the ratepayers to the shareholders. Insofar as the ratepayers have borne the costs for creating value in petitioner's name and reputation, the ratepayers are entitled to a prudent use of those assets.  The RVAM properly compensates ratepayers for petitioner's imprudence in allowing the free use of its intangible assets rather than impermissibly granting ratepayers a direct interest in those assets.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Finding of Imprudence by Utility A fair reading of the Public Service Commission (PSC) opinion which imposed a 2% royalty on petitioner utility arising out of improper cost-shifting and uncompensated transfers of petitioner's intangible assets between petitioner and its subsidiaries and affiliates indicates that the PSC concluded that petitioner acted imprudently by permitting its subsidiaries and affiliates to use valuable intangible assets, such as petitioner's name and logo, free of charge, and that the PSC considered the prudence standard in making its determinations.  Though it would have been preferable for the PSC to explicitly state that petitioner acted imprudently, there is no reason to require the incantation of certain &quot;magic&quot; words when PSC's opinion clearly contains, through the use of other words, a finding of imprudence. Accordingly, because the record supports that finding, the Appellate Division's affirmance of PSC's imprudence determination will not be disturbed by the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Validity of Public Service Commission's Imputation of 2% Royalty Payment with Respect to Utility's Investment in Unregulated Operations - Application of Royalty as Rebuttable Presumption to Other Utilities Respondent Public Service Commission's (PSC) conclusion that petitioner utility's imprudence in permitting its subsidiaries and affiliates to use valuable intangible assets free of charge could be imputed to all utilities through imposition of a rebuttable presumption of a 2% royalty in the future is rational.  The circumstances which led to the imprudence finding as to petitioner are not unique to that utility.  Further, PSC considered the submissions of numerous regulated utilities who, at PSC's invitation, participated in the underlying hearings.  It was reasonable to conclude that a utility that permits its subsidiaries and affiliates to exploit valuable intangible assets for free, acts imprudently. Moreover, the imputation of the royalty does not result in an automatic obligation to pay the royalty. Utilities will have the opportunity to challenge the application of the presumption to their individual cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Validity of Public Service Commission's Imputation of 2% Royalty Payment with Respect to Utility's Investment in Unregulated Operations - Improper Shifting of Costs The positive benefits component of a 2% royalty imposed by respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) on petitioner utility, which was designed to address the improper shifting of costs from the unregulated subsidiaries and affiliates to the regulated utility, is supported by the record.  The record contains evidence of actual costs imposed on ratepayers as a result of petitioner's diversification and evidence of petitioner's abundant incentive to shift costs from its unregulated subsidiaries and affiliates to its monopoly operations.  Given the complexity of the relationships between various utilities and their subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as the volume of transactions that must be scrutinized, PSC's conclusions that certain costs could not be adequately quantified and that current oversight systems could not capture all cases of improper cost shifting, were rational and supported by the record.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Validity of Public Service Commission's Imputation of 2% Royalty Payment with Respect to Utility's Investment in Unregulated Operations - Rationality of Quantification of Royalty at 2% Respondent Public Service Commission's (PSC) exercise of discretion in setting at 2% the level of a royalty designed to compensate ratepayers for the uncompensated use of petitioner utility's intangible assets by its subsidiaries and affiliates and the costs of diversification, without imposing a penalty on petitioner, did not lack a rational basis. Rate making is a highly technical field within the special expertise of the PSC.  In quantifying the royalty, PSC applied the expertise it had acquired in the context of previous settlements, where the amount of rate adjustments could not be precisely or objectively determined.  The record also contained evidence that the PSC had previously imputed a percentage in quantifying objectively unascertainable items such as reasonably anticipated productivity improvements and allowances for certain types of advertising. PSC's exercise of judgment in this highly technical field was reasonable, especially given the ability of individual utilities to rebut the 2% figure.  The PSC envisioned situations in which individual utilities would be required to pay a different or no royalty percentage, and this built-in flexibility renders the rebuttable presumption rational because any royalty ultimately imposed will be tailored to the individual circumstances of particular utilities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Justiciable Questions - Unconstitutional Taking Claim Appellant utilities' argument that the rebuttable presumption created by respondent Public Service Commission of a 2% royalty in the future for rate-making purposes whenever a utility invests in competitive enterprises constitutes an unconstitutional taking under the Federal and New York State Constitutions is not justiciable because the impact of the rebuttable presumption cannot be evaluated separate and apart from the actual application of the royalty to a particular utility.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Justiciable Questions - Commerce Clause Violation The issue whether the rebuttable presumption created by respondent Public Service Commission of a 2% royalty in the future for rate-making purposes whenever a utility invests in competitive enterprises violates the Commerce Clause may properly be decided by the Court of Appeals because the relevant standard for determining the validity of State statutes affecting interstate commerce permits evaluation of the widespread, general effects of a State regulation.  Evaluation of the royalty need not be limited to the effects generated by specific applications of the rebuttable presumption, but rather the royalty's general effects on interstate commerce may be considered.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Utilities - Rate Making - Constitutionality of Public Service Commission's Imputation of 2% Royalty with Respect to Utility's Investment in Unregulated Operations - Commerce Clause The rebuttable presumption created by respondent Public Service Commission (PSC) of a 2% royalty in the future for rate-making purposes whenever a utility invests in competitive enterprises does not violate the Commerce Clause.  The royalty is to be applied evenhandedly, since the applicable PSC opinion contains no exemptions for investment in New York State subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, since the royalty is imposed on the utilities, not on out-of-State subsidiaries and affiliates, the financial impact on interstate commerce appears negligible.  Since the State has a legitimate interest in setting just and reasonable utility rates, and the royalty is rationally related to that end, PSC's actions do not impose an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Water and Sewer Rates - Validity of Benefit Assessment Methodology The benefit assessment methodology used to assess charges against property owners within respondent Fire and Water District, pursuant to which the benefit to be conferred on each parcel was to be calculated by assigning all existing residential structures in the District one to three benefit assessment units based on the District average of gallons consumed, gallons required per day, by assigning larger commercial structures benefit assessment units based on their actual metered daily consumption, and by projecting the reasonably likely development and resulting water needs over time of undeveloped parcels based on zoning ordinances and approvals as well as factors such as parcel shape, frontage and topography, is valid and proper and the special assessments imposed thereunder, fully authorized by the District's voters, were valid and constitutional.  A detailed study was performed by the Board of Trustees before implementation of the assessment methodology and, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, the assessment is presumed valid.  In any event, these taxpayers failed to offer sufficient proof that the amounts of the special assessments levied against them were substantially in excess of the undisputed benefits they will ultimately receive as a result of the new water treatment plant. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-profit organization and related parties alleged that the disparity in the amount of money spent per pupil between the wealthy school districts and the poorer districts violated N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court ruled that the non-profit organization and related parties failed to state a cause of action under N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1 because they failed to allege that the students in the poorer districts were deprived of a sound basic education. Article XI, &sect; 1 did not require that all school facilities be substantially equal. A gross disparity in funding, alone, was insufficient to establish the absence of a sound basic education. The court also ruled that the complaint failed to state a cause of action under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The desire to provide local control over education was a rational basis upon which to base the financing system. Modification of the appellate court's decision, however, was necessary to reflect only that the allegations raised in the complaint did not demonstrate that the financing system was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Article XI, &sect; 1 does not mandate that all educational facilities and services be substantially equal throughout the State.  Rather, it was intended to require the Legislature to provide a State system of free schools availing all of the State's children of a sound basic education.  Plaintiffs do not claim that students in their districts are receiving something less than a sound basic education and, therefore, even accepting plaintiffs' allegations of gross disparities as true, their cause of action must fail because they do not state a claim that the disparities have caused students in the poorer districts to receive less than a sound basic education.  </SPAN></P>

Because the municipal entities were simply political subdivisions or creatures of the State, the only exceptions to the general rule, which the municipal entities failed to prove, were: (1) where an express statutory authorization to bring such a suit existed; (2) where the State legislation adversely affected a municipality's proprietary interest in a specific fund of moneys; (3) where the State statute impinged upon the &quot;Home Rule&quot; powers of a municipality; and (4) where the municipal entities asserted that if they were obliged to comply with the State statute they would by that very compliance be forced to violate a constitutional proscription.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Capacity of Municipalities to Challenge Constitutionality of State's School Funding Scheme The City of New York, Board of Education of the City, its Mayor and Chancellor of the City School District (municipal plaintiffs) lack capacity to bring an action against the State and various State officials challenging the constitutionality of the present State statutory scheme for funding public education. Municipalities and other local governmental corporate entities and their officers lack capacity to mount constitutional challenges to acts of the State and State legislation.  This general incapacity to sue flows from judicial recognition of the juridical as well as political relationship between those entities and the State.  Municipal corporate bodies--counties, towns and school districts--are merely subdivisions of the State, created by the State for the convenient carrying out of the State's governmental powers and responsibilities as its agents.  As purely creatures or agents of the State, municipal corporate bodies cannot have the right to contest the actions of their principal or creator affecting them in their governmental capacity or as representatives of their inhabitants.  The only recognized exceptions to the general rule barring local governmental challenges to State legislation are: an express statutory authorization to bring such a suit; where the State legislation adversely affects a municipality's proprietary interest in a specific fund of moneys; where the State statute impinges upon &quot;Home Rule&quot; powers of a municipality constitutionally guaranteed under article IX of the State Constitution; and where the municipal challengers assert that if they are obliged to comply with the State statute they will by that very compliance be forced to violate a constitutional proscription. Here, however, the municipal plaintiffs have failed to bring their claims within any recognized exception to the general rule that municipalities lack capacity to sue the State and their action must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a non-profit organization of community school boards and others, appealed from the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) that dismissed claims against defendants, the State of New York and its officials, in a challenge to the constitutionality of the state's public school financing system which allegedly did not provide the opportunity to obtain a proper education to students in the city of New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a non-profit organization of community school boards and others, filed an action that sought a declaratory judgment against defendants, the State of New York and its officials. It alleged that the state's public school financing system was unconstitutional because it did not provide school students in the city of New York an opportunity to obtain a sound basic education. The state supreme court dismissed equal protection claims and claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000d et seq., for failure to state a cause of action. The appellate division dismissed the other claims. The court modified the order, holding that plaintiffs pled sustainable claims under the Education Article of N.Y. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1, and under the implementing regulations of Title VI, 34 C.F.R. &sect; 100.3(b)(2). Plaintiffs alleged gross educational inadequacies that, if proven, could support a finding that the school financing system was unconstitutional under the Education Article. In challenging the allocation of education aid, plaintiffs provided statistical support for the disparity between aid distributed to the city's minority and non-minority students.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of State's Public School Financing System The Education Article of the State Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1) requires the State to offer all children the opportunity of a sound basic education consisting of the basic literacy, calculating, and verbal skills necessary to enable children to eventually function productively as civic participants capable of voting and serving on a jury.  Thus, in an action challenging the constitutionality of the State's public school financing system under, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Education Article, the State will have satisfied its constitutional obligation if the physical facilities and pedagogical services and resources made available under the present system are adequate to provide children with the opportunity to obtain these essential skills. While plaintiffs rely on the minimum State-wide educational standards established by the Board of Regents and the Commissioner of Education, proof of noncompliance with one or more of the Regents' or Commissioner's standards may not, standing alone, establish a violation of the Education Article because many of those standards exceed notions of a minimally adequate or sound basic education.  Further, performance levels on standardized competency examinations are helpful, but should also be used cautiously.  The trial court will have to evaluate whether the children in plaintiffs' districts are in fact being provided the opportunity to acquire the basic literacy, calculating and verbal skills necessary to enable them to function as civic participants capable of voting and serving on a jury.  In order to succeed in the specific context of this case, plaintiffs will have to establish a causal link between the present funding system and any proven failure to provide a sound basic education to New York City school children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of State's Public School Financing System - Sufficiency of Cause of Action under Education Article of State Constitution The nonschool board plaintiffs have properly stated a cause of action challenging New York State's public school financing system as violative of the Education Article of the State Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1) based upon allegations that New York City students are not receiving the opportunity to obtain an education that enables them to speak, listen, read, and write clearly and effectively in English, perform basic mathematical calculations, be knowledgeable about political, economic and social institutions and procedures in this country and abroad, or to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in democratic self-government, supported by fact-based claims of inadequacies in physical facilities, curricula, numbers of qualified teachers, availability of textbooks, library books, etc.  Taking as true the allegations in the complaint, plaintiffs allege and specify gross educational inadequacies that, if proven, could support a conclusion that the State's public school financing system effectively fails to provide for a minimally adequate educational opportunity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Constitutionality of State's Public School Financing System - Equal Protection of Laws - Federal and State Constitutions Plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action challenging New York State's public school financing system as violative of the Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11).  Education is not a fundamental right under the United States Constitution or the State Constitution and, therefore, the rational basis test is the appropriate standard for equal protection analysis under both Constitutions.  Any disparities in educational funding among school districts in the State arising from the State's financing scheme are rationally based upon and reasonably related to a legitimate State interest--the preservation and promotion of local control of education.  Moreover, while plaintiffs have alleged that the State's educational funding methodology has a disparate impact upon African-American and other minority students, no discriminatory intent has been charged, and an equal protection cause of action based upon a disproportionate impact upon a suspect class requires establishment of intentional discrimination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Sufficiency of Discrimination Cause of Action under Title VI of Civil Rights Act Plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action that the State's public school financing system violates title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC &sect; 2000d) because the complaint contains no showing of intentional discrimination, which is required to succeed on a title VI claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - State Aid to School Districts - Sufficiency of Discrimination Cause of Action under Implementing Regulations of Title VI of Civil Rights Act Plaintiffs have stated a cause of action that the State's public school financing system violates the implementing regulations of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;34 CFR 100.3 [b] [2]).  Under title VI's implementing regulations, proof of discriminatory intent is not a prerequisite to a private cause of action against governmental recipients of Federal funds.  A validly stated cause of action under the title VI regulations has two components: whether a challenged practice has a sufficiently adverse racial impact and, if so, whether the practice is nevertheless adequately justified.  Here, New York State is a recipient of Federal funds for education, and plaintiffs have alleged that the State's benefit distribution practice has the effect of subjecting minority students to discrimination on the basis of their race, color, or national origin supported by statistics pointing to the disparity between the total and per capita education aid distributed to New York City's predominantly minority student population as opposed to the amount distributed to the State's nonminority students, and defendants have not yet advanced a substantial justification for the challenged practice at this procedural point.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen-taxpayers challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which dismissed a complaint that sought to enjoin the results of a bond referendum because defendant board had allegedly used public funds to produce false materials in favor of the bond. The complaint also alleged defendant government officials used state moneys in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on allegations that defendant board had used public funds to prepare and distribute false promotional materials in favor of an affirmative vote on a bond proposition, plaintiff citizen-taxpayers sought to enjoin the results of a bond referendum. Plaintiffs also alleged that defendant government officials had printed documents with state moneys to serve private political purposes in violation of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8(1). When the trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint, plaintiffs sought review. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. In affirming, the court found plaintiffs' action against defendant board was properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 2037 conferred exclusive original jurisdiction upon the Commissioner of Education regarding all disputes over the validity of school district elections. In reversing, the court held defendant government officials had transgressed constitutional boundaries because documents produced with state moneys had not been disseminated to educate, inform, advocate, or promote voting, but instead had been disseminated to enlist the public's support in opposition to a political party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment dismissing a complaint that sought to enjoin a bond referendum's results because the Commissioner of Education had exclusive original jurisdiction over disputes concerning the validity of school district elections.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools - Bond Referendum - Jurisdiction of Commissioner of Education over Claim of Invalidity of Referendum Plaintiffs' cause of action seeking to enjoin or invalidate the results of a school district's bond referendum because of the alleged distribution at public expense of partisan and false promotional literature regarding the referendum by the Board of Education was properly dismissed because Education Law &sect; 2037 confers exclusive original jurisdiction upon the State Commissioner of Education regarding all disputes over the validity of school district meetings and elections. Judicial review of any unfavorable decision by the Commissioner regarding a complaint made pursuant to section 2037 would have been available and could have fully addressed plaintiffs' claim that false and partisan promotional materials were disseminated at school district expense.  That plaintiffs' complaint regarding the school board's distribution of the allegedly tainted materials was couched in terms of a constitutional violation did not obviate the statutory mandate to originate the matter before the Commissioner.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contempt - When Appropriate - Disobedience of Invalid Court Order Inasmuch as Supreme Court lacked original subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' cause of action seeking to enjoin or invalidate the results of a school district's bond referendum--exclusive original jurisdiction residing in the Commissioner of Education pursuant to Education Law &sect; 2037--Supreme Court also lacked jurisdiction to entertain and then grant plaintiffs' application for an order temporarily staying the referendum and, therefore, disobedience of that order cannot be punished as a contempt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Taking of Property - Sufficiency of Cause of Action Plaintiffs' cause of action alleging that the unconstitutional uses of certain public funds violated their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution as a taking of their property without due process of law was properly dismissed since they have not alleged any actual appropriation of their individual property by the governmental action they describe, or even an indirect invasion of their specific property rights through regulation of the use thereof.  Plaintiffs merely alleged that governmental revenues, concededly acquired lawfully through State or local tax levies, have been misused or misapplied to private purposes and, therefore, they have not validly alleged any violation of the Due Process or &quot;Takings&quot; Clauses of the Federal Constitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Unconstitutional Gift of Public Funds - Publication of Partisan Political Newsletter by State Agency Plaintiffs' allegations that the publication and mailing of a newsletter by the Governor's Office of Economic Development constituted the use of State moneys to serve private political purposes of the Governor, his campaign committee and the State Democratic Committee in violation of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8 (1) properly states a cause of action where the subject document, disseminated on the eve of the 1992 Presidential campaign, sought to enlist the public's support in opposition to the alleged Republican position on the welfare and Medicaid reform issues in addition to containing factual information which would have been of assistance to the electorate in making all educated decision on whose position to support.  The use of public funds out of a State agency's appropriation to pay for the production and distribution of campaign materials for a political party or a political candidate or partisan cause in any election would fall squarely within article VII, &sect; 8 (1)'s prohibition against gifts or loans to private enterprises.  Under the applicable constitutional standard, election material may be disseminated at public expense to educate, inform, advocate or promote voting on any issue, provided it is not to persuade nor to convey favoritism, partisanship, partiality, approval or disapproval by a State agency of any issue.  Here, the latter part of the document is patently designed to exhort the electorate to make an avowed, public commitment in support of a particular position advocated by one political faction and, therefore, plaintiffs have stated a valid cause of action under article VII, &sect; 8 (1), notwithstanding that the newsletter also contains information that, standing alone, would be considered a proper attempt to educate the public.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state tax commissioner sought review of a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which held that appellee vendors were not, under the Commerce Clause, required to collect state use taxes based on their sales to New York customers, because neither vendor maintained a substantial physical presence in New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the appellate division applied the improper standard. Rather than a substantial physical presence, the commissioner was required to prove only a minimum connection with the state in order to be authorized to collect the use tax. The court reviewed the Supreme Court jurisprudence, concluding with Quill Corporation v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298. The court read Quill as adopting a middle course, rejecting the requirement of some physical presence of the vendor as a minimum connection in the taxing state to support the jurisdiction to tax under the Due Process Clause, but requiring some physical presence of an interstate mail-order vendor in the taxing state for validity of the authority to tax under the Commerce Clause. In this case, there was substantial evidence to support the State Tax Appeals Tribunal's determination that the vendors' activity in New York was sufficient to impose the obligation to collect compensating use taxes on their taxable retail sales to New York customers. Both vendors sent salesmen into the state, resulting in substantial sales.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the case of one vendor, the court affirmed the judgment as modified, awarded costs to commissioner, and remitted the matter to the Appellate Division for further proceedings. In the case of the other vendor, the court reversed the judgment, awarded costs, and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Sales and Use Taxes - Out-of-State Vendor - Nature of Presence in New York Necessary under Commerce Clause to Impose Tax Collection Duty In order to impose a duty on an out-of-State vendor to collect a compensating use tax (Tax Law &sect; 1110) from its New York clientele without contravening the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8), a physical presence of the vendor is required, which need not be substantial but must be demonstrably more than a &quot;slightest presence&quot;.  And it may be manifested by the presence in the taxing State of the vendor's property or the conduct of economic activities in the taxing State performed by the vendor's personnel or on its behalf.  Accordingly, there was substantial evidence to support the determination of the Tax Appeals Tribunal that the activity of petitioner, a Vermont vendor, in New York was sufficient to impose the obligation to collect compensating use taxes on its retail sales to New York customers where petitioner's substantial wholesale business in New York was generally accomplished by means of its sales personnel's direct solicitation of retailers through visits to their stores in New York, subject only to approval of all orders in Vermont.  Moreover, the affidavits of petitioner's officers suggest systematic visitation to all of its as many as 19 wholesale customers on the average of four times a year, which demonstrably exceeds the &quot;slightest presence&quot; of petitioner in New York.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Sales and Use Taxes - Out-of-State Vendor - Nature of Presence in New York Necessary under Commerce Clause to Impose Tax Collection Duty In order to impose a duty on an out-of-State vendor to collect a compensating use tax (Tax Law &sect; 1110) from its New York clientele without contravening the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8), a physical presence of the vendor is required, which need not be substantial but must be demonstrably more than a &quot;slightest presence&quot;.  And it may be manifested by the presence in the taxing State of the vendor's property or the conduct of economic activities in the taxing State performed by the vendor's personnel or on its behalf.  Accordingly, there was substantial evidence to support the determination of the Tax Appeals Tribunal that the activity of petitioner, a Vermont vendor, in New York was sufficient to impose the obligation to collect compensating use taxes on its retail sales to New York customers where petitioner's hardware and software sales agreements obligated it to provide a charge-free visit of a computer software installer at its customer's site in New York if problems necessitating the visit occurred within the first 60 days of installation.  Moreover, petitioner's invoices showed charges for travel expenses to its New York customers' locations on 41 occasions, in order to resolve the more intractable problems involving its computer hardware and software, during the three-year audit period, in which petitioner had 154 taxable transactions in New York.  There was ample support in the record for the Tax Appeals Tribunal's finding that petitioner's trouble-shooting visits to New York vendees and its assurances to prospective customers that it would make such visits enhanced sales and significantly contributed to petitioner's ability to establish and maintain a market for the computer hardware and software it sold in New York.  Petitioner's activities in New York were, thus, definite and of greater significance than merely a slightest presence.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen and plaintiff various non-profit corporations brought an action against defendant governor, which sought a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the Executive Order No. 141, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9 &sect; 4.141. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial District (New York) reversed the dismissal of the action and declared Executive Order No. 141 unconstitutional. The governor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue was whether Executive Order No. 141, which directed the Department of Public Service (Department) to certify the establishment of a Citizens' Utility Board (CUB), violated the principle of separation of powers under the New York State Constitution. The court concluded that the governor acted within his authority and, therefore, that the order was improperly declared unconstitutional. The court reasoned that while it may have been more desirable for the legislature to have passed a statute establishing the CUB, the question whether the governor had the authority to do so by executive order was not one of preference but of constitutionality. The court held that because the governor did not act inconsistently with the legislature, he did not usurp the legislatures' prerogatives and that the doctrine of separation of powers was not violated. The court determined that it was within the court's role to dictate how public policy should have been implemented, but only to state when and how the constitution was offended. The court held the constitution was not violated by Executive Order No. 141.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's order was reversed with costs, the governor's motion for summary judgment was granted, the citizen's and the non-profit corporations' cross motion for summary judgment was denied, and judgment was granted declaring that Executive Order No. 141 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Separation of Powers - Creation of Citizens' Utility Board with Access to State Agency Mailings by Executive Order Executive Order No. 141 (9 NYCRR 4.141), which authorized the creation of a private, not-for-profit corporation known as the Citizens' Utility Board (CUB) intended to represent the interests of residential utility customers in ratemaking and other proceedings before the Public Service Commission and provided that the Board would have access to as many as four State agency mailings per year, did not violate the principle of separation of powers under the New York State Constitution.  The constitutional principle of separation of powers requires that the Legislature make the critical policy decisions, while the executive branch's responsibility is to implement those policies.  It is only when the executive acts inconsistently with the Legislature or usurps its prerogatives that the doctrine of separation is violated.  The creation of the CUB was fully consistent with existing legislative policy inasmuch as three other entities already had overlapping authority to protect utility customers. Executive Order No. 141 does not formulate a specific policy with respect to utility companies or their residential customers. The executive branch's mere creation of a new procedural, administrative mechanism, such as a task force or consumer board, to better implement a legislative policy does not offend the Constitution.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Murder - Depraved Indifference Murder - Constitutional Considerations Penal Law &sect; 125.25 (4) is not unconstitutionally vague: brutality toward a child, such as the conduct with which defendant was charged, fits within the accepted understanding of the kind of recklessness involving a depraved indifference to human life, and that element of the crime of second degree murder is an objective aggravating circumstance, rather than a part of the crime's mens rea. The fact that the statute encompasses conduct &quot;which creates a grave risk of serious physical injury or death&quot; does not render the statute unconstitutionally vague since the type and level of risks to be avoided by the actor are specifically delineated. The differential treatment of those who intentionally set out to injure but cause death, and those who recklessly cause death while acting with depraved indifference does not violate any substantive due process or equal protection rights; the Legislature could rationally conclude that the existence of circumstances evincing &quot;depraved indifference&quot; is an aggravating factor warranting more serious punishment, even where the conduct was accompanied by a reckless rather than intentional mental state. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town appealed, in part, a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), to the extent that it ordered a refund of $ 27,000 paid by plaintiff business owners in sewer and water tap-in fees that had been held unconstitutional. Defendant challenged plaintiffs' entitlement to the refund based on plaintiffs' failure to register a formal protest upon payment of the fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owners remitted $ 27,000 to defendant town in sewer and water tap-in fees assessed in conjunction with their application for a building permit to proceed with plans for renovating and expanding their business premises. The fees were adopted in response to state and federal mandates to upgrade defendant's sewer and water systems. The fees were declared unconstitutional, a ruling defendant did not challenge on appeal. However, it did challenge the judgment refunding the fees paid plus interest, costs, and disbursements. The lower appellate court had affirmed the award, holding that plaintiffs involuntarily paid the fees to avoid threatened interference with immediate possession of their property. The court granted leave to appeal and reversed the judgment below to the extent that it directed a refund. The court relied on the settled rule that voluntary payment of a municipal fee, even if subsequently nullified, was not recoverable absent a showing of formal protest at the time of payment. The only exception was if plaintiffs paid under duress. The court held that the evidence did not establish such duress because the project was in its planning phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the refund order, holding that plaintiff business owners were not entitled to a refund because the fees were not paid &quot;under protest.&quot; Having failed to alert defendant town to the uncertainty of those revenues, a step that was plainly important to governmental fiscal operations, plaintiffs could not recover even an illegal payment absent proof it was made under duress. The court held that the evidence did not establish duress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Water and Sewer Rates - Recovery of Unconstitutional Tap-In Fees - Absence of Protest or Duress Plaintiffs, who remitted sewer and water tap-in fees to defendant municipality in conjunction with their application for a building permit to proceed with a planned renovation of new business premises, are not entitled to a refund of those fees, which subsequently were declared unconstitutional, where plaintiffs failed to register any protest upon payment and there is no evidence that the fees were paid under actual duress. A simple payment &quot;under protest&quot; for the taxpayer preserves its challenge and for the municipality alerts it, at the time of receipt, to the uncertainty of those revenues.  Short of that simple, unequivocal step--plainly important to governmental fiscal operations--a taxpayer may recover an illegal payment only where the taxpayer establishes that payment was made under duress, meaning more than business or economic inconvenience.  Here, plaintiffs failed to make that showing.  Plaintiffs were not prevented from possessing or using their property and showed no impairment to their business operations.  All plaintiffs showed was that they could not proceed with an intended renovation as they had hoped.  That plaintiffs anticipated disruption of their tight renovation schedule absent prompt payment of the tap-in fees is insufficient to constitute duress or coercion and excuse formal protest. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent police officer filed a petition seeking an order requiring appellant city and police department to appoint the police officer as a detective with retroactive salary under N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 58(4)(c) (1990). The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the lower court's order granting the police officer's petition. The city appealed alleging the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer served as a detective on a temporary appointment for more than 18 months. He petitioned to make the appointment permanent under &sect; 58(4)(c). On appeal, the city argued that &sect; 58(4)(c) was unconstitutional because it violated the civil service requirements in N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 that appointments or promotions be merit-based and determined, where practicable, by competitive examination. The court held that, because N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 58(4)(c) (1990) mandated both an appointment and promotion within the meaning of N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6, and because there was no evidence whatsoever of a legislative consideration or determination of impracticability of testing for the detective rank, N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 58(4)(c) (1990) was unconstitutional. The court found that there was no state of facts concerning the enactment of the legislation from which to assume the legislature considered the impracticability of testing and that an implied finding of impracticability was unsupportable because testing occurred annually. The court found that being on the job in a temporary appointment was not a substitution for the constitutional requirement of competitive testing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - Constitutionality of Statute Providing for Appointment of Police Officers to Detective Rank without Competitive Testing Civil Service Law &sect; 58 (4) (c), which provides that a police officer who has been temporarily assigned to perform the duties of a detective shall, whenever the appointment exceeds 18 months in duration, be appointed as a detective and receive the compensation ordinarily paid to a detective performing such duties, violates the overriding constitutional prerequisite of NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 6, that appointments or promotions within the State civil service system be merit-based and determined, where practicable, by competitive examination. The constitutional dictate of article V, &sect; 6 does not create an absolute bar to civil service appointments and promotions without competitive examinations, but an untested appointment or promotion must rest on a legislative determination that ascertaining fitness by competitive examination is impracticable, and a sound, discernible basis supporting the Legislature's determination of impracticability. Because Civil Service Law &sect; 58 (4) (c) mandates both an appointment and promotion within the meaning of article V, &sect; 6 of the New York Constitution, and because there is no evidence whatsoever of a legislative consideration or determination of impracticability of testing for the detective rank, the enactment fails its constitutional threshold.  Moreover, the existence of annual competitive testing for the detective rank belies any assertion that an officer's fitness for the position cannot be assessed, at least to some degree, by competitive examination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - What Constitutes Civil Service Law &sect; 58 (4) (c), which provides that a police officer who has been temporarily assigned to perform the duties of a detective shall, whenever the appointment exceeds 18 months in duration, be appointed as a detective and receive the compensation ordinarily paid to a detective performing such duties, effects a mandate to municipal employers to appoint an officer to the position of detective, which constitutes an actual &quot;appointment&quot; and &quot;promotion&quot; within the meaning of NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 6, requiring merit and fitness constitutional scrutiny, satisfaction or explicit dispensation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - Effect of Delayed Vesting of Right to &quot;For-Cause&quot; Removal Hearing on Appointment or Promotion Status for Purposes of Merit and Fitness Clause Civil Service Law &sect; 58 (4) (c), which provides that a police officer who has been temporarily assigned to perform the duties of a detective shall, whenever the appointment exceeds 18 months in duration, be appointed as a detective and receive the compensation ordinarily paid to a detective performing such duties, falls within the constitutional prerequisite of NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 6, that appointments or promotions within the State civil service system be merit-based and determined, where practicable, by competitive examination, notwithstanding that under Civil Service Law &sect; 75 (1) (e) a detective's rights to a &quot;for-cause&quot; removal hearing do not vest until the detective has held that position for three years.  Civil Service Law &sect; 75 (1) (e) provides that even where a detective has served for at least three years, no dismissal hearing is required when reduction in rank from said position is based solely on reasons of the economy, consolidation or abolition of functions, curtailment of activities or otherwise.  Thus, a rationale that equates hearing rights with permanency of appointment would logically lead to the conclusion that the appointment or promotion to the detective rank could hardly ever be considered permanent, because discretionary type factors could always lead to a reduction in rank without a hearing.  Under such a &quot;hearing rights&quot; rationale, no appointments to detective rank could ever be considered truly permanent and, hence, such elevations in rank would never be deemed promotions or appointments for purposes of the Merit and Fitness Clause of the Constitution (NY Const, art V, &sect; 6).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - Practicability of Competitive Testing - On-the-Job Performance as Substitute to Competitive Testing While in some exceptional, appropriate circumstances on-the-job performance may be used to assess merit and fitness for the purpose of civil service appointment and promotion (NY Const, art V, &sect; 6), the constitutional requirement to competitively test where practicable may not be blinked away simply upon the basis of satisfactory performance during temporary or out-of-title service in a higher position.  Notwithstanding a public employee's satisfactory on-the-job performance, when qualifications are subject, even in part, to objective assessment, those objectively testable qualities must be evaluated by competitive examination. While untestable attributes may be considered and included as components of a complete evaluation of merit and fitness, and while other alternative noncompetitive measures of fitness may be employed to assess those more subjective attributes, the constitutional requirement to test competitively for objectively ascertainable qualities may not be summarily evaded by the Legislature or by the courts.  </SPAN></P>

Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 505.7(g)(4) to require that tests be ordered individually and not in panels or profiles. The association challenged the amendment and the department's interpretation. The association brought an action, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, on the grounds that the amended regulation violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitution and was not being interpreted in a manner consistent with its plain meaning. The trial court granted the petition, finding the regulation was null and void, the interpretation was arbitrary and capricious, and awarded the association costs and attorney fees. On the department's appeal, the appellate court reversed in part, finding the regulation valid, but finding the interpretation to be overly broad. The court also denied attorney fees. On the association's appeal of the denial of attorney fees, the court affirmed the decision. The court determined that the association was not a &quot;prevailing party&quot; under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Equal Access to Justice Act -- &quot;Prevailing Party&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A party has &quot;prevailed&quot; within the meaning of the State Equal Access to Justice Act (CPLR art 86 [EAJA]) if it has succeeded in acquiring a substantial part of the relief sought in the lawsuit. Thus, a &quot;prevailing party&quot; is not one who has succeeded on merely &quot;any significant issue&quot; in the litigation which achieved only &quot;some of the benefit&quot; sought in bringing the lawsuit. Rather, it is a plaintiff who can show that it succeeded in large or substantial part by identifying the original goals of the litigation and by demonstrating the comparative substantiality of the relief actually obtained.  Accordingly, in a CPLR article 78 proceeding alleging that amended 18 NYCRR 505.7 (g) (4), which changed the Medicaid payment methodology for certain diagnostic laboratory tests performed by independent laboratories, lacked a rational basis, violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions and was being interpreted by respondent in a manner inconsistent with its plain language, petitioner was not a &quot;prevailing party&quot; within the meaning of the State EAJA where the only issue on which petitioner prevailed was the inconsistency between respondent's interpretation of the regulation and its plain language. Although petitioner succeeded in correcting an improper interpretation of the amended regulation, it failed to win a substantial part of the relief originally sought in bringing the lawsuit--invalidation of the amended regulation as lacking a rational basis or violative of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Equal Access to Justice Act -- Standard to Determine Whether State's Position &quot;Substantially Justified&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. With respect to the State Equal Access to Justice Act (CPLR art 86 [EAJA]), which provides that &quot;a court shall award to a prevailing party, other than the state, fees and other expenses incurred by such party in any civil action brought against the state, unless the court finds that the position of the state was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust&quot; (CPLR 8601 [a]), the phrase &quot;substantially justified&quot; means justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person or having a reasonable basis both in law and fact.  An issue-by-issue analysis of the government's posture in the litigation should be rejected in favor of a more broadly focused analysis that would reject the view that any unreasonable position taken by the government in the course of litigation automatically opens the door to an EAJA fee award. Thus, in a CPLR article 78 proceeding in which petitioner sought to invalidate amended 18 NYCRR 505.7 (g) (4) as lacking a rational basis or violative of equal protection, and a declaration that respondent was interpreting the regulation in a manner inconsistent with its plain language, the State's position in the litigation was substantially justified where the only relief awarded to petitioner was correction of the improper interpretation of the regulation. Respondent's position as to the central controversy of the case--the validity of the change in payment methodology embodied in the amended regulation--was completely vindicated.  Although petitioner gained the benefit of an ameliorative measure--correction of respondent's overbroad interpretation of the amended regulation--when respondent's position is considered in its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">entirety,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the only logical conclusion is that it was substantially justified, i.e., it had a reasonable basis in both fact and law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order convicting defendant of criminal possession of gambling records in the first degree and of 35 counts of promoting gambling in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on charges of promoting gambling based on bets received and placed. The charges stemmed from a court-ordered eavesdropping warrant. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was granted on the ground that the wiretap warrant and affidavits were not timely given to defendant as required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 700.70. The court dismissed the indictment. The People secured a second indictment and gave defendant timely notice of the use of the wiretap evidence, but, at trial, defendant was informed that additional wiretap evidence obtained by Canadian authorities would be introduced. Defendant was convicted, and the intermediate court affirmed. The appellate court reversed holding that the People failed to give defendant statutory notice of the use of the Canadian wiretap evidence and that preclusion of the New York wiretap evidence for lack of timely notice following the first indictment barred its use in the prosecution of the second indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction for promoting gambling where the People failed to give defendant statutory notice of the use of Canadian wiretap evidence. The court held that preclusion of New York wiretap evidence for lack of timely notice following an earlier indictment barred its use in this prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Eavesdropping Warrants - Legality of Monitoring Conversations Incidental to Intentional Surveillance Interception in Toronto, Canada, by Canadian authorities of a telephone conversation between a Canadian suspect and defendant--located in New York--did not constitute a violation of New York's privacy act (Penal Law art 250).  Article 250 criminalizes the act of &quot;intentional overhearing or recording of a telephonic ... communication&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 250.00 [1]).  Monitoring of defendant's conversations was incidental to intentional surveillance of the Canadian suspect's conversations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Eavesdropping Warrants - Notice Requirement Applicable to Foreign Wiretap Evidence In the prosecution of defendant for various gambling offenses, wiretap evidence consisting of conversations between defendant in New York and an individual in Canada, which were intercepted by Canadian authorities during the course of an independent investigation of the Canadian suspect, should have been precluded in defendant's New York prosecution because of the People's failure to provide timely notice under CPL 700.70.  While New York law governing acquisition of wiretap evidence in New York State is, by its terms, inapplicable to the methods by which foreign law enforcement officials procure wiretap evidence, New York law does at a minimum control the conduct of New York prosecutors seeking to introduce wiretap evidence into New York courts.  Thus, the statutory procedure applicable to admissibility of electronic eavesdropping evidence--independent of any questions concerning the authorization and acquisition of such evidence--obligated the People to provide defendant, within 15 days of arraignment, with copies of the Canadian wiretap warrant and affidavits to permit him to investigate grounds for suppression. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Eavesdropping Warrants - Failure to Give Timely Notice Not Cured by Commencing Second Prosecution and Giving New Timely Notice Where the indictment charging defendant with various gambling offenses alleged to have occurred during August 27, 1990 through September 10, 1990, was dismissed after New York State wiretap evidence of the charged crimes was precluded for lack of timely notice under CPL 700.70, the People cannot cure their initial failure to provide defendant with timely notice of the eavesdropping warrant and supporting application by commencing a new prosecution and serving him a second time, immediately upon his arraignment on the second indictment. If the People, unable to establish good cause for delay, were simply allowed to begin a new prosecution at which defendant were furnished timely notice of intent to use wiretap evidence, the notice provision would be easily sidestepped and of little force.  Nor would a permissive reading conform to the bedrock principle that there must be strict compliance with the provisions of New York's eavesdropping statute and that the burden of establishing such compliance rests with the prosecution.  Further, a permissive reading of New York's wiretap provisions is particularly unwarranted in the present case, where the People commenced a second prosecution designed to circumvent impediments brought about by their initial, unexplained failure to comply with their statutory duty.  The crimes charged in the second indictment, while for the most part occurring on different dates, were in other respects the same as those charged in the first indictment. Thus, any counts in the second indictment that duplicate counts of the first indictment or are based on evidence derived from the unnoticed warrant must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of orders denying their motions to set aside their criminal convictions for prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.

The court held the denials of motions to vacate convictions based on either prosecutorial misconduct or ineffective assistance of counsel did not occur in a special proceeding and were not final for purposes of determining appellate jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, three Onondaga County Court judges, commenced an action challenging the disparity that existed between their salary and the salary of their counterparts in 13 other counties. Appellant court administrators challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court in Onondaga County (New York), which awarded the judges attorneys' fees in their action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gist of the judges' complaint was that the pay discrepancies violated their constitutional equal protection rights because there was no rational basis for the disparate treatment. The complaint sought retroactive back pay and an incidental award of attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The main issue on the appeal from the judgment awarding attorneys' fees was whether, in a prior appeal, the appellate division erred in declining to consider the merits of a determination on the ground that it was embodied in an earlier judgment that was final and thus not reviewable under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 5501 (a)(1). On appeal, the court held that the refusal to review the issue the court administrators proffered was error. The order granting summary judgment on the judges' first cause of action and dismissing the others could not be deemed final. The order was facially nonfinal because it left pending the assessment of attorneys' fees. The resolved causes of action for declaratory and monetary relief were based on the same continuum of facts as the unresolved &sect; 1988 attorney-fee claim, which was the enactment of a judicial salary scheme that allegedly violated equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment awarding the judges attorneys' fees in their action and the case was remitted for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Finality of Judgments and Orders - Order That Leaves Pending Assessment of Attorneys' Fees A final order or judgment is one that disposes of all of the causes of action between the parties in the action or proceeding and leaves nothing for further judicial action apart from mere ministerial matters.  Thus, a Supreme Court order granting plaintiffs summary judgment on their first cause of action, dismissing plaintiffs' 16 other causes of action and granting plaintiffs' request for counsel fees pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1988 but postponing assessment of the amount pending a hearing, cannot be deemed final for purposes of determining its appealability or reviewability. Although all of the substantive issues between the parties were resolved, the order was facially nonfinal, since it left pending the assessment of attorneys' fees--a matter that plainly required further judicial action of a nonministerial nature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Finality of Judgments and Orders - Doctrine of Implied Severance - Order That Leaves Pending Assessment of Attorneys' Fees Under the doctrine of implied severance, an order that disposes of some but not all of the causes of action asserted in a litigation between parties may be deemed final for purposes of determining its appealability or reviewability only if the causes of action it resolves do not arise out of the same transaction or continuum of facts or out of the same legal relationship as the unresolved causes of action. Implied severance is not applied where the court's order decides some issues of relief but leaves pending between the same parties other such issues, thereby in effect dividing a single cause of action. Accordingly, with respect to a Supreme Court order which granted plaintiffs summary judgment on their first cause of action, dismissed plaintiffs' 16 other causes of action and granted plaintiffs' request for counsel fees pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1988 but postponed assessment of the amount pending a hearing, implied severance is not available to convert that facially nonfinal order to a theoretically final one.  The resolved causes of action for declaratory and monetary relief were based on the same continuum of facts as the unresolved 42 USC &sect; 1988 attorney-fee claim, i.e., the enactment of a judicial salary scheme that, in plaintiffs' view, violated their right to equal protection of the laws.  Without that legislative act and the surrounding circumstances that plaintiffs allege rendered the act unlawful, there was no predicate for either a substantive cause of action or a claim for the attorneys' fees incurred in vindicating plaintiffs' rights.  Moreover, plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees was made in the form of a demand for &quot;costs,&quot; which was included in the boilerplate portion of the complaint seeking &quot;[s]uch other, further and different relief which the Court may deem just and proper&quot; and, as such, was an integral part of each of the asserted causes of action rather than a separate cause of action of its own.  Thus, the pending request for attorneys' fees could not have been divided from the otherwise resolved causes of action and implied severance was necessarily unavailable.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Pesticides - Authority of Commissioner to Prohibit Use of High Concentration DEET Products by Rule Making The Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation does not lack statutory authority to ban pesticide products by rule making.  Title 3 of ECL article 33, and particularly section 33-0303 (3) (d) and (e) contain broad legislative delegations to the Commissioner to act against dangerous pesticides, even to ban them outright, by means of legislative rule making.  Moreover, the legislative history clearly indicates an intent to authorize a complete ban on the use of dangerous pesticides under certain circumstances.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Pesticides - Power of Commissioner to Resolve by Rule-Making Question of Fact as to Hazardous Nature of Pesticide Current registrants of products containing a high concentration of the pesticide DEET may be precluded from challenging in an adjudicatory registration cancellation hearing the underlying scientific bases for a new rule that prohibits use, sale or distribution of pesticide products containing DEET in concentrations greater than 30% (6 NYCRR 326.2 [b] [10]).  The general administrative law principle is that a regulation adopted in a legislative rule-making proceeding, such as the DEET rule, can apply to foreclose litigation of issues in any individual adjudicatory proceeding provided for under the enabling legislation.  That petitioners have a cognizable economic interest in their pesticide product registrations does not change this result.  A registration is for administrative law purposes nothing more than a license or &quot;similar form of permission required by law&quot; (State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 102 [4]), in this case, permission to sell or otherwise distribute a pesticide product, and statutory rights to a full adjudicatory hearing before denial or withdrawal of all such forms of permission may be trumped by the agency rule-making authority.  ECL article 33 gives the Commissioner authority to promulgate a list of restricted use pesticides (ECL 33-0303 [3] [d]) which are, by definition, &quot;pesticide[s] ... [w]hich the Commissioner finds [are] so hazardous to man or other forms of life that restrictions on [their] sale, purchase, use, or possession are in the public interest&quot; (ECL 33-0101 [42] [b]), and, therefore, the legislatively authorized power to declare a pesticide restricted is necessarily a fact-finding power vested in the Commissioner.  Nor does the legislative history to the various provisions of article 33 compel a deviation from the basic rule that a broad grant of rule-making power standing side-by-side with individual adjudicatory rights in an enabling statute includes the power to resolve by rule making a question of fact that would otherwise be at issue in an adjudicatory proceeding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Pesticides - Validity of Regulation Prohibiting Use of High Concentration DEET Products 6 NYCRR 326.2 (b) (10), which prohibits the use, sale or distribution of pesticide products containing the pesticide DEET in concentrations greater than 30% (the DEET rule), is not irrational or arbitrary and capricious.  The Department of Environmental Conservation's background documents and assessment of public comments detail 44 scientific studies and empirical data that indicate that use of high concentration DEET products may cause adverse health effects.  In addition, the affidavit of the State Department of Health Director of the Division of Environmental Health Assessment fully explains and documents the ample support for the conclusion that DEET in concentrations above 30% is dangerous to health, particularly to that of children.  Thus, the record contains sufficient evidence to provide a rational basis for the Commissioner's conclusion that possible detrimental side effects from the human use of high concentration DEET products outweigh possible benefits from their use.  The Commissioner, therefore, did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in promulgating the DEET rule.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Environmental Quality Review - Regulation Prohibiting Use of High Concentration DEET Products The Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) did not violate the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8 [SEQRA]) by issuing a Determination of Non-Significance with regard to the environmental impact of 6 NYCRR 326.2 (b) (10), which prohibits the use, sale or distribution of pesticide products containing the pesticide DEET in concentrations greater than 30% (the DEET rule).  The record amply demonstrates that DEC identified the relevant area of environmental concern (the alleged possibility that the DEET rule could enhance the incidence of vector-borne Lyme Disease), and took a hard look at all the evidence available on the issue.  Having taken this hard look, DEC could reasonably conclude that the DEET rule would not cause any significant environmental impact.  That DEC considered the concern raised by petitioner's submissions is evidenced by the DEC's revised negative declaration, made after the legislative rule-making public hearing, which gave a reasoned elaboration of its determination that the DEET rule would have no significant impact on the environment.  Thus, DEC established full compliance with statutory and court-imposed SEQRA requirements.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Commerce Clause - Validity of State Regulation Prohibiting Use of High Concentration DEET Products 6 NYCRR 326.2 (b) (10), which prohibits the use, sale or distribution of pesticide products containing the pesticide DEET in concentrations greater than 30% (the DEET rule), does not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 USC &sect; 136 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delegates to States the authority to regulate the sale and use of pesticides </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;7 USC &sect; 136v). Where State or local government action is specifically authorized by Congress, it is not subject to the Commerce Clause even if it interferes with interstate commerce. Moreover, States may act to regulate matters of legitimate local concern even though such regulation affects interstate commerce. The regulation at issue here was enacted in the interest of public health and safety--obviously legitimate local concerns--and, concededly does not discriminate between in-State and out-of-State manufacturers and distributors.  Petitioners have made no showing that the burden imposed on commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits, and their bare allegation that the DEET rule imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce is insufficient to render the rule unconstitutional.  The constitutionality of the rule should, therefore, be sustained.  </SPAN></P>

Election Law &sect; 6-158 specifies filing requirements and deadlines for nominating and designating petitions and certificates for candidate acceptances and declinations, for the holding of judicial conventions, and for the filling of vacancies as to nominations--by both political parties and independent bodies.  Subdivisions (6) through (8) of section 6-158 address party nominations, while subdivisions (9) through (12) correspondingly address the deadlines with respect to independent nominations and certificates of acceptance or declination thereof; in parallel fashion to subdivision (8) addressing party nominations, there is a provision setting a deadline for filling a vacancy with respect to independent nominations caused by a declination (Election Law &sect; 6-158 [12]).  Having thus set forth the various deadlines, including those for the filling of vacancies for both party and independent nominations in the foregoing subdivisions of Election Law &sect; 6-158, subdivision (13) of that section addresses alternative time requirements for filling a vacancy in the event that &quot;a vacancy occurs too late to comply with the provisions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">this section&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (emphasis supplied).

The corporation met with city officials who agreed to grant the exemption in exchange for a substantial payment by the corporation. The developer refused to pay the trust the promissory note it had executed and the city filed suit. The court held that (1) the agreement between the parties whereby the city provided the developer an expedited and favorable determination as to the single-room occupancy multiple dwelling (SRO) status of the building in exchange for money was void, violative of public policy, and unenforceable, (2) the developer's counterclaim for damages caused by the city's delay in issuing the permits needed to construct the building was dismissed, (3) the city's decision whether to issue a permit was discretionary and therefore immune from suit, (4) there was no contract between the developer and the city and (5) the developer's counterclaim was not viable as a claim for breach of contract.</SPAN></P>

The statute at issue required the owners to offer renewal leases to the hospital. The issue before the court was whether chapter 940 of the Laws of 1984 substantially advanced a legitimate state interest, justifying the state's imposition of distinctive encumbrances and obligation on the owner's property rights. The court concluded that chapter 940 failed the test of substantially advancing a legitimate state interest warranting the indeterminate and unjustifiable burden draped disproportionately on the owner's shoulders. The court explained that the underlying purpose of the rent stabilization law was to ameliorate the dislocations and risk of widespread lack of suitable dwellings. Owners contended that chapter 940 resulted in a regulatory wresting away of their reversionary property interests. The court reversed the order of the Appellate Division and declared chapter 940 of the laws of 1984 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landlord and Tenant - Rent Regulation - Renewal Lease - Constitutionality of Statute Mandating Renewal Leases for Not-For-Profit Hospital Which Subleases Apartments to Employees - Regulatory Taking Laws of 1984 (ch 940), which requires the owners of several New York City rent-stabilized apartments to offer renewal leases to a not-for-profit hospital enterprise for apartments occupied by some of the hospital's employees, does not advance a legitimate State interest justifying the State's imposition of distinctive encumbrances and obligations on plaintiffs' private property rights and, therefore, effects an unconstitutional regulatory taking. Governmental regulation which limits owners' rights to possess, use or dispose of property may amount to a taking of the affected property if the regulation denies an owner economically viable use of the property, or if the regulation does not substantially advance legitimate State interests.  Further, the substantial State purpose for such legislation must be bound by a close causal nexus to survive scrutiny.  While chapter 940 purports to justify and accomplish its objective through an amendment tied to the general purposes of the Rent Stabilization Law (RSL) and Emergency Tenant Protection Act, which coexist to remedy a persisting emergency housing shortage, chapter 940 contradicts two key goals of the RSL--occupant protection and eventual market redemption--by transferring power from a landlord to the employer of the actual occupants and by removing the affected apartments entirely and permanently from marketplace availability or potentiality for other publicly interested or vying occupants at rent-stabilized rates.  Thus, the legislation does not substantially advance a closely and legitimately connected State interest.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public housing finance agency enlisted the UDC to participate in a housing project so that the UDC could use its eminent domain powers. The UDC gave notice and conducted a public hearing and thereafter declared that it would exercise its condemnation power, even though an environmental impact statement had not been prepared as required by the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA). The noncondemnees argued that the UDC acted outside the scope of its authority and that the UDC had not complied with the requirements of the SEQRA or the New York Eminent Domain Procedure Law (EDPL). The UDC argued that the noncondemnees lacked standing. The court agreed, holding that N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. L. &sect;&sect; 201-204 and 207 did not provide standing to noncondemnees. Thus, all that the noncondemnees were entitled under the EDPL was a properly conducted hearing held on proper notice. Nor did the SEQRA provide standing under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, as the scope of judicial review under the EDPL included review of whether a condemnor's determination was in accord with the SEQRA.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Standing of Noncondemnee to Challenge Condemnation under EDPL Petitioners, condominium boards, tenants and residents of buildings near a New York City site planned to be developed for public housing, do not have standing to challenge the actions of the condemnor, respondent Urban Development Corporation (UDC), in acquiring the site, in a proceeding pursuant to EDPL 207.  While EDPL 207 (A) provides that &quot;[a]ny person or persons jointly or severally, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">aggrieved</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the condemnor's determination and findings ... may seek judicial review thereof&quot; (emphasis added), the aggrievement of noncondemnees such as petitioners necessarily depends on the rights the EDPL extends to them and whether the condemnor has invaded or jeopardized those rights.  The notice and hearing provisions in EDPL 201-204 are the only provisions in the EDPL which explicitly address the interests of noncondemnees, and those provisions were intended solely to permit public participation in the planning of the project so that the impact of the proposed project could be addressed at the planning stage.  Thus, all that petitioners are entitled to under the EDPL is a properly conducted hearing held on proper notice and, since such a hearing took place here, petitioners have no assertable EDPL standing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Condemnation - Zone-of-Interest Test Inappropriate The zone-of-interest test employed in determining standing in proceedings involving zoning laws is inappropriate in the context of eminent domain proceedings.  Standing in zoning cases is a broader concept because zoning statutes seek to protect the welfare of the entire community, by making a balanced and effective use of the available land and providing for the public need for varying types of uses and structures.  In contrast, eminent domain statutes seek primarily to protect the interests of property owners and to ensure that their property is taken only in accord with proper procedure and for just compensation.  To the extent the New York Eminent Domain Procedure Law now takes cognizance of other interests--the right of the public to be informed of a proposed condemnation and to be given the opportunity to participate in planning of the project--those interests are protected by the statutory mandate of a public hearing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Condemnation - Effect of EDPL Amendment Permitting Review of SEQRA Compliance The 1991 amendment to the scope of judicial review under EDPL 207 to include review of compliance with the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8 [SEQRA]) does not endow noncondemnees with standing under the EDPL for all purposes.  A noncondemnee who can allege and establish EDPL aggrievement, and who can also maintain a separate article 78 challenge to a SEQRA finding, should be entitled to seek SEQRA review in the eminent domain proceeding also.  That narrowly expanded scope of review, however, applies only to those first establishing EDPL standing.  It does not allow a petitioner possessing only SEQRA standing to acquire EDPL standing generally by bootstrapping EDPL claims onto a legitimate SEQRA claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parties - Standing - Condemnation - &quot;Friendly Condemnation&quot; That important community concerns may receive short shrift in cases of so-called &quot;friendly condemnation&quot;--in which the condemnee desires the condemnation as ardently as does the condemnor--does not, standing alone, entitle a noncondemnee to standing to challenge the condemnation. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) in their suit against respondents, state and public authorities, which affirmed the constitutionality of 1993 N.Y. Laws 56 (Act). The Act authorized a multibillion dollar bond issue for state and local transportation improvements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens alleged that the Act violated multiple constitutional provisions, but the trial and appellate courts held that the citizens only had voter standing to challenge the Act under N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11, the constitutional mandate that state contracts for debt be submitted for public referendum. The court agreed with the lower courts' rulings that the Act was constitutional. The court stated that although the state was barred from lending its credit to a public authority, the state was free to give money to a public authority and to commit itself to giving future gifts. The court concluded that the Act, which contemplated annual appropriations derived from taxes and fees, involved current and future gifts to the public authorities and not debts. Because no debt was involved, the court held that the Act did not violate N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Contracting State Debt without Public Referendum - Debt Contracted by Public Authorities Laws of 1993 (ch 56) (the Act) authorizing a multibillion dollar bond issue by the State Thruway Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) for improvements to the State's transportation system does not violate the constitutional prohibition against contracting State debt without a public referendum (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 11), on the ground that debt contracted by the public authorities is indistinguishable from debt contracted by the State.  The State Constitution gives full recognition to the existence of public benefit corporations, their independent capacity to contract debt, and the continued power of the State to make gifts of money to those authorities.  Thus, for the purpose of contracting their own legally binding obligations, the Thruway Authority and MTA are public benefit corporations existing independently of the State (NY Const, art X, &sect; 5).  Moreover, contracting of debt by public authorities is not the aim of the referendum requirement.  Further, since the Constitution expressly empowers public authorities to contract debt independently of the State, the Act, by authorizing the Thruway Authority and MTA to issue bonds, does not contract legally binding debt upon the State.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Contracting State Debt without Public Referendum - Moral Obligation to Appropriate Revenue for Special Funds Operated by Public Authorities Laws of 1993 (ch 56) (the Act) authorizing a multibillion dollar bond issue by the State Thruway Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for improvements to the State's transportation system does not contract debt of the State without a public referendum in violation of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 11 by imposing a moral obligation on the Legislature to continue appropriating revenue to the special Funds targeted for financing by the Act.  A moral obligation is not in and of itself &quot;debt&quot;.  The bonds authorized by the Act were not labelled &quot;moral obligation bonds&quot; by the Legislature, and entirely apart from nomenclature the Act does not create such an obligation.  The Act requires a statement on the face of the bonds that they are not a debt of the State and are payable only out of the Authorities' funds.  Moreover, the Act disavows existence of a moral obligation on the part of the State to appropriate revenues in the future.  These disclaimers--particularly when read in light of the constitutional prohibition against State assumption of authority debt (NY Const, art X, &sect; 5)--are sufficient to remove any reasonable expectation on the part of bondholders that the State will guarantee return in the event of default on the part of the Authority or that the bonds place them in privity with the State.  Most critically, a moral obligation cannot be judicially imposed upon the State in the absence of its consent to be so bound.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Contracting State Debt without Public Referendum - Proposal to Appropriate Revenues in Future for Special Funds Operated by Public Authorities Laws of 1993 (ch 56) (the Act), which authorizes a multibillion dollar bond issue by the State Thruway Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for improvements to the State's transportation system, but does not obligate the State to appropriate revenues in the future for the special Funds targeted to be financed by the Act, does not contract debt of the State without a public referendum in violation of NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 11 on the ground that, as a practical matter, the Legislature will as always appropriate money for the special Funds rather than risk damaging the State's credit rating.  A proposal to fund in a subsequent year, subject to legislative appropriation and explicit disclaimer, does not create legally binding debt.  While the Legislature might make the appropriations to the Funds, to be used in turn to service the Authorities' debt, it is not bound to do so.  Should it fail to do so, and the Authority default, the State is not liable to the bondholders under the provisions of the Act.  Because the State does not become indebted, the financing subject to appropriation does not constitute the lending of credit or assumption of the liability of a public corporation, or indebtedness of the State for purposes of the constitutional limits on such debt.  The funds--if appropriated--constitute a permissible gift of money to a public corporation out of existing revenues, creating no debt (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state deputy commissioner of health and others, appealed from a decision of Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which modified an order partially denying the summary judgment motion of plaintiff hospital operator by granting the summary judgment motion in its entirety regarding the underlying declaratory judgment action to challenge aspects of the state's Medicare reimbursement rate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that hospital operator's summary judgment motion was properly granted with respect to its challenge to the retroactive application of a recalibration regulation to calculate the hospital operator's nursing home Medicaid reimbursement rates. However, summary judgment was improperly granted to hospital operator on its challenge to the change in the manner in which hospitals were reimbursed for services provided to certain patients. The court noted that although hospital operator had sought a declaration that the reimbursement rate decision was arbitrary and capricious, hospital operator's action could have been brought in the form of a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 because its claim was encompassed within the grounds for mandamus to review set forth in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7803(3). The court then concluded that the four-month statute of limitations for N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 actions was applicable and the underlying action, brought more than two years after the rate decision, thus was untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order under review by reinstating the trial judge's ruling so as to deny partially hospital operator's motion for summary judgment because hospital operator it had lost the right to challenge the validity of the underlying rate decision through its own inaction. The order, as modified, was then affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- What </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Governs -- Declaratory Judgment Action Challenging Change in Medicaid Reimbursement Rates as Irrational or Affected with Error of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The four-month Statute of Limitations for proceedings against a body or officer (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPLR 217) is applicable to a declaratory judgment action challenging a disputed change in promulgated Medicaid reimbursement rates for services provided to certain hospital patients on the ground that the rates are irrational or affected with error of law. When a proceeding against a State or municipal governmental entity has been commenced in the form of a declaratory judgment action, for which no specific Statute of Limitations is prescribed, it is necessary to examine the substance of that action to identify the relationship out of which the claim arises and the relief sought in order to resolve which Statute of Limitations is applicable.  Where a quasi-legislative act by an administrative agency such as a rate determination is challenged on the ground that it was made in violation of lawful procedure, was affected by an error of law or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion (CPLR 7803 [3]), a proceeding in the form prescribed by article 78 can be maintained and, as a corollary matter, the four-month Statute of Limitations that ordinarily governs such proceedings is applicable.  Here, the nature of plaintiff's claim requires it to convince the court that defendants promulgated a rule affecting hospital rates that represented an irrational construction of the governing statutes and such a claim is plainly encompassed within the grounds for mandamus to review set forth in CPLR 7803 (3). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Medicaid Reimbursement Rates -- Validity of Recalibration Adjustment for Rate Years Preceding Promulgation of Adjustment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Public Health Law &sect; 2807 (7) (a) prohibits the use of a &quot;recalibration adjustment&quot; promulgated in December 1991 to calculate the residential-care facility rates of plaintiff for the rate years between 1989 and 1991 (10 NYCRR 86-2.31 [a]). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- When Remedy Available -- Mandamus to Review- - Quasi-Legislative Acts of Administrative Agencies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. CPLR article 78 review in the nature of mandamus to review is available with respect to challenges to the quasi-legislative acts of administrative agencies to the extent that the challenge fits within the language and accompanying gloss of CPLR 7801 and 7803 (3)--where the quasi-legislative act such as a rate determination is challenged on the ground that it was made in violation of lawful procedure, was affected by an error of law or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion. The separation of powers principle underlying the historical bar precluding use of article 78 to challenge legislative acts has no application to the quasi-legislative acts of administrative agencies. While in most situations, agencies' generally applicable decisions do not lend themselves to consideration on their merits under the provisions for mandamus to review, because they concern rational choices among competing policy considerations and are thus not amenable to analysis under the &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; standard, there are cases in which even a nonindividualized, generally applicable quasi-legislative act such as a regulation or an across-the-board rate-computation ruling can be challenged as being &quot;affected by an error of law,&quot; &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; or lacking a rational basis (CPLR 7803 [3]). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Medicaid Reimbursement Rates -- Availability of Refund to Provider Not Party to Action Resulting in Invalidation of Reimbursement Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where a Medicaid reimbursement policy governing services provided to certain hospital patients was invalidated in an action in which plaintiff provider was not a party and plaintiff had lost the right to challenge the validity of the underlying rate decision through expiration of the four-month Statute of Limitations, plaintiff had no legal basis for its demand, after invalidation of the reimbursement policy, for a refund of the moneys that had been recouped from it pursuant to the invalidated policy.  Thus, to the extent that plaintiff's complaint asserted a timely cause of action based on the refusal of that demand, the claim was lacking in substantive merit and was properly rejected.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Denial of Refund to Medicaid Provider Not Party to Action Resulting in Invalidation of Medicaid Reimbursement Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Equal protection principles do not guarantee plaintiff, an operator of hospitals and Medicaid provider, the same relief as was afforded to the members of a hospital association that successfully challenged, in an action in which plaintiff was not a party, Medicaid reimbursement rates for services provided to certain hospital patients resulting in defendants' issuance of refunds to the association's members.  Since the hospital association was a party to the action that resulted in invalidation of the Medicaid reimbursement policy and had standing to represent its members, defendants could rationally distinguish between those members whose rights had been adjudicated in the action, and plaintiff, a nonparty whose rights had not been addressed in that or any other judicial proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 186-a (2-a) declared unconstitutional, defendant, the Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF), sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which, after reversing the judgment of dismissal from the trial court, declared &sect; 186-a (2-a) to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimant brought an action against the DTF, alleging that N.Y. Tax. Law &sect; 186-a (2-a) was unconstitutional. The claimant alleged that the pre-apportionment deduction under &sect; 186-a (2-a) discriminated against long-distance carriers engaged in interstate and foreign commerce because a wholly intrastate long-distance carrier could claim an absolute dollar-for-dollar deduction and by contrast, a long-distance carrier like the claimant, which engaged in interstate commerce, could only benefit in proportion to the percentage of its property within the state. The trial court granted the DTF's motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The appellate division reversed the judgment and declared that &sect; 186-a (2-a) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order, holding that because the statute created a differential tax treatment, which resulted solely from whether the situs of the taxpayer's activities was in state or out of state, it provided a commercial advantage to local business and was therefore unconstitutionally discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - &quot;Access Fee&quot; Tax Deduction for Interstate Long-Distance Carriers Tax Law &sect; 186-a (2-a) which, with respect to calculation of the deduction from income permitted long-distance carriers for access service fees paid to local exchange carriers in connection with long-distance intrastate telephone calls, requires that the deduction be allocated against interstate and international revenues prior to apportionment to New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 184 [4]) violates the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8).  In computing the allowable access fee deduction, the statute requires apportionment of access fees only by long-distance carriers which engage in interstate commerce and are unable to directly account for their New York revenues.  By requiring the interstate long-distance carrier to calculate the deduction before apportionment to New York of a percentage of its entire gross income based upon the proportion of the carrier's property in New York, the statute has the practical and real effect of treating differently long-distance carriers similarly situated in all respects except for the percentage of their property located within New York State.  While a wholly intrastate long-distance carrier may deduct all of its New York access fees, the interstate carrier is limited to its apportionment percentage, even though both companies are reporting 100% of their New York taxable income. The access fees are fixed and easily traceable to New York and, therefore, the access fees are already apportioned to the State.  Requiring the deduction to be taken before apportionment plainly creates a direct commercial advantage to intrastate long-distance carriers. Moreover, no showing has been made by the State that the discriminating methodology advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The women claimed that New York's PCAP was unconstitutional because it was underinclusive in failing to include medically necessary abortions in a prenatal care public funding scheme for women with incomes up to 85 percent over the federal poverty level. Congress created PCAP to afford federal reimbursement to states providing prenatal care and related services for needy pregnant women with household incomes exceeding the Medicaid eligibility standard. The women contended that the legislature violated an obligation under the Due Process Clause not to influence the exercise of a fundamental right by funding childbirth and not abortion. The court held that New York's PCAP was constitutional. The women failed to establish their contention that New York's PCAP even indirectly infringed the right of reproductive choice. There was no evidence that eligible women were coerced, pressured, steered, or induced by New York's PCAP to carry pregnancies to term. New York's PCAP did not in any sense burden a fundamental right and bore a rational relationship to the state's interest in providing much-needed prenatal care to low-income women.</SPAN></P>

There is no evidence that PCAP even indirectly infringes the right of reproductive choice.  The PCAP-eligible woman presumptively has the financial means to exercise her fundamental right of choice.  That the Legislature in the circumstances elects to subsidize certain prenatal services cannot, in and of itself, be deemed coercive, and no showing has been made that such a woman would be influenced by PCAP to carry a child to term.  Nor does PCAP penalize the exercise of the right of choice, as it does not deny eligibility for any benefit to which participants choosing to abort would otherwise be entitled.  Moreover, a challenge to PCAP asserting a denial of equal protection (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11) fails for much the same reasons.  </SPAN></P>

PCAP-eligible women are presumptively able to afford abortion, a legislative premise not rebutted on the record.  The contrary cannot be inferred from the mere fact that PCAP was enacted.  Moreover, it cannot be said beyond a reasonable doubt that, by not including abortion funding in PCAP, the Legislature transgressed its powers to promote the State's interest in aiding the needy and promoting public health in such manner, and by such means as the Legislature may from time to time determine (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 1, 3).  </SPAN></P>

When defendant owner inherited a mobile home from her father, plaintiff village instituted an action to have the mobile home removed. The trial court granted defendant's cross motion for summary judgment, reasoning that the right to continue a nonconforming use runs with the land and that the portion of the ordinance setting termination at the transfer of ownership was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed. The court modified the order of the appellate court and denied defendant's cross motion for summary judgment. The court found that the law was not rendered invalid because the original owner enjoyed a right that could not be transferred to a subsequent owner. The test for the validity of an amortization period was whether the period unreasonably inflicted substantial loss on the owner or failed to comport to the reasonableness required by due process.

Defendant has failed to carry her burden of showing that chapter 85 of the Village Code of the Village of Valatie, which terminates the nonconforming use of a mobile home upon the transfer of ownership of either the mobile home or the land upon which it sits, is facially unconstitutional on the ground that the use of a change in ownership as the termination date is not reasonably related to the Village's legitimate interest in land use planning because the length of the amortization period must be related either to land use objectives or to the financial recoupment needs of the owner.  The length of the amortization period need not be based on a municipality's land use objectives.  Instead, the setting of the amortization period involves balancing the interests of the individual and those of the public.  Here, in striking that balance, the Village considered a nonfinancial interest of the individual owners--the individual's interest in not being displaced involuntarily through establishment of a predetermined amortization period set by the Village--and defendant has not demonstrated why such an approach is irrational or explained why a municipality should be barred constitutionally from considering the nonfinancial interests of the owners in setting an amortization schedule.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant has failed to carry her burden of showing that chapter 85 of the Village Code of the Village of Valatie, which terminates the nonconforming use of a mobile home upon the transfer of ownership of either the mobile home or the land upon which it sits, is facially unconstitutional on the ground that the use of a change in ownership as the termination date violates the fundamental rule that zoning deals basically with land use and not with the person who owns or occupies it, because the right to the nonconforming use is enjoyed only by those who owned the property when the local law was enacted and cannot be transferred. Here, no individual is singled out for special treatment in land use regulation.  Moreover, the mere fact that the right cannot be transferred or that later owners are treated disparately from the original owner is insufficient to sustain defendant's facial challenge to the ordinance.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Sentencing defendant, who was 17 years old at the time of the crime, to the mandatory minimum of 15 years to life imprisonment for a class A-I felony conviction arising from her sale of 2 ounces, 33 grains of cocaine to an undercover officer in a known drug location for $ 2,000, is not so grossly disproportionate to the crime as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment (US Const 8th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 5).  The selling of narcotic drugs represents a grave offense of the first magnitude.  Further, in comparison to the sanctions for other crimes under the Penal Law and for the same or similar drug offenses in other jurisdictions, the mandatory sentences for drug offenses, while relatively severe, are not irrationally so, given the epidemic dimensions of the problem.  The punishment received by defendant's confederate, who was the principal in the drug operation in which defendant's sale took place--a sentence of 15 years to life imprisonment pursuant to a bargained plea of guilty to one of the five criminal sales of a controlled substance in the first degree charged in the indictment--does not establish gross disproportionality. Moreover, the undisputed evidence as to the extent of defendant's culpability in the cocaine sale and the threat she poses to society is not overly favorable to defendant.  The only strongly mitigating factor, defendant's youth, is alone insufficient to establish gross disproportionality for constitutional purposes.  </SPAN></P>

Health Law &sect; 19 was enacted in the contemplation that it would operate in conjunction with the Federal Budget Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989. Thus, a rational construction of &sect; 19 was that the term &quot;reasonable charge&quot; was used to refer to Medicare's recognized, reasonable payment amount as determined by HHS, irrespective of the particular methodology employed to calculate that amount.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Public Health Law &sect; 19, which, effective January 1, 1991, placed percentage caps on charges made by physicians to Medicare beneficiaries in excess of the &quot;reasonable charge for that service as determined by the United States secretary for health and human services [HHS]&quot;, did not become unenforceable as of January 1, 1992, when HHS stopped using the &quot;reasonable charge&quot; method of reimbursement and adopted a fee schedule based on a resource-based relative value scale.  The Legislature's purpose in enacting section 19 was to prevent physicians who use balance billing from charging Medicare beneficiaries excessive amounts for certain services.  The Legislature was aware that the &quot;reasonable charge&quot; system would be discontinued as of January 1, 1992.  Nevertheless, it enacted section 19 in the contemplation that the statute would operate in conjunction with the strong provisions of the Federal Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989 to increase the number of fully participating physicians who, rather than balance bill, would accept the reasonable rate as full payment for all services for all Medicare patients. Thus, a rational construction of the statute at issue is that the term &quot;reasonable charge&quot; was used by the Legislature to refer to Medicare's recognized, reasonable payment amount as determined by HHS, irrespective of the particular methodology employed to calculate that amount.  To interpret the statute in any other fashion would frustrate the clear intent of the Legislature and lead to an absurd result. </SPAN></P>

The constitutional proscription applies where incorporation by reference results in the creation of substantive obligations or requirements.  Although section 19's imposition of fee restrictions is effectuated by reference to the Federally recognized payment amount, the statute is otherwise complete and contains all the information required for intelligent and discrete action by the Legislature.  The statute does not incorporate any new substantive requirements or obligations.  The Legislature, in enacting section 19, was concerned with capping the amount above Medicare's recognized payment schedule for physicians' services to Medicare beneficiaries--irrespective of the particulars involved in calculating that amount.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the legislature did not intend &sect; 1802 to be applied retroactively because a portion of the conduct needed for conviction under &sect; 1802, past failure to file returns, occurred prior to the effective date of &sect; 1802. The court ruled that &sect; 1802 was not being applied retroactively in his case because the actual unlawful conduct, the subsequent failure to file a return, occurred after the statute's effective date. The fact that an antecedent act occurred prior to the effective date did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err in providing the jury with a supplemental instruction on the essential element of timeliness. The trial court had a duty, under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 310.30 to respond to the jury's request that the elements of the offenses be repeated. The fact that the trial court initially omitted a discussion on the timeliness element, and had to bring the jury back to correct the omission, did not render the instruction unfair.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tax Law &sect; 1802 proscribing repeated failure to file a tax return, which became effective on November 1, 1985 and was made applicable to all offenses committed on or after such date, was not retroactively applied to defendant who was convicted under section 1802 based upon his failure to file New York State personal income tax returns for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985.  A statute is not retroactive when made to apply to future transactions, merely because such transactions relate to and are founded upon antecedent events.  Here, defendant &quot;committed&quot; the section 1802 offense when he failed to file his 1985 tax return by April 15, 1986, having then failed to file his returns for three consecutive years as provided by section 1802.  His conduct thus falls within the plain statutory language concerning the applicability of the section.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Repeated Failure to File Tax Return - Ex Post Facto Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Tax Law &sect; 1802 proscribing repeated failure to file a tax return, which became effective on November 1, 1985 and was made applicable to all offenses committed on or after such date, does not constitute an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to defendant based upon his failure to file New York State personal income tax returns for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985.  Defendant did not commit the repeated failure to file offense until he failed to file his 1985 return by April 15, 1986, a point in time well after section 1802's effective date. A conviction under section 1802 is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier nonfilings. It is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.  Moreover, defendant, having failed to file returns for the two consecutive years of 1983 and 1984, was given fair warning by the enactment of section 1802 that his failure to file a return for 1985 would result in criminal liability for repeated failure to file under that section.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Instructions - Supplementary Instructions - Propriety of Correction of Prior Supplementary Instruction Absent Request by Jury </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the prosecution of defendant for failure to file a tax return (Tax Law &sect; 1801) and repeated failure to file a tax return (Tax Law &sect; 1802), the trial court did not commit error in giving supplemental instructions to the jury regarding a timeliness element in any of the offenses, i.e., that the statute is violated by a failure to file within the time required by law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 1801 [a]), on the grounds that the instruction on timeliness was unrequested and unbalanced, where, after the court reread the elements of both offenses to the jury at the jury's request, the court recognized that it had failed to reiterate the timeliness element of the offenses and reinstructed the jury regarding that element.  The trial court fulfilled its duty to respond meaningfully to the jury's inquiry by correcting its prior supplementary instruction to assure that the jury was not deliberating under a misapprehension of the law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 310.30).  The timeliness instruction cannot be characterized as unrequested since the inclusion of the timeliness requirement was especially pertinent to rendering a meaningful response to the jury's inquiry here in light of the fact that defendant did ultimately file untimely returns.  Moreover, defendant's claim that the timeliness instructions were so unbalanced as to preclude the jury from properly considering the main defense theory--i.e., that defendant lacked intent to evade taxes--is unpersuasive as the court explicitly prefaced the timeliness instruction with a reiteration that the individual must intend to evade the tax.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Verdict - &quot;Jury Nullification&quot; - Presentation of Concept of Jury Nullification during Defense Summation Prohibited </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In the prosecution of defendant for failure to file a tax return (Tax Law &sect; 1801) and repeated failure to file a tax return (Tax Law &sect; 1802), the trial court correctly prohibited defendant from presenting the concept of jury nullification during summation.  While there is nothing to prevent a petit jury from acquitting although finding that the prosecution has proven its case, this so-called &quot;mercy-dispensing power&quot; is not a legally sanctioned function of the jury and should not be encouraged by the court.  Permitting defense counsel instead to encourage the jury to abdicate its primary function would directly contravene the trial court's authority to instruct the jury that they must follow and properly apply the law.  </SPAN></P>

The private utility argued that N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law &sect; 1199-eee(5)&nbsp;unconstitutionally limited the court's power to determine just compensation designated to the judiciary by N.Y. Const. art.

The private utility argued that &sect; 1199-eee(5)&nbsp;unconstitutionally restricted the court to determining the value of the property taken solely to the &quot;income capitalization&quot; method, which it felt was inadequate. The court held that the power given to the court by N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 7a to provide just compensation for property taken by eminent domain could not be limited by the legislature. Therefore, &sect; 1199-eee(5), interpreted in the light of its presumed constitutionality, was held to only imply a preference for the income capitalization method, but not to require it as the sole means of determining the condemned property's value. This meant, the court held, that the court's inherent authority to determine just compensation was not impermissibly restricted by the statute.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eminent Domain - Award - Water Authority - Just Compensation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding challenging two determinations of respondent Water Authority condemning petitioners' assets and real property for the creation of a countywide coordinated public water system, petitioners' contention that Public Authorities Law &sect; 1199-eee (5) impermissibly mandates exclusive use of the income capitalization method in determining compensation in condemnation situations and that such a legislative command effectively usurps the power to determine just compensation designated to the judiciary by the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 7) is rejected; the just compensation which the State Constitution requires to be paid to the owner of property taken under the power of eminent domain cannot be reduced to inflexible formulas or inexorable rules, and the language of Public Authorities Law &sect; 1199-eee (5) implies only a preference for and does not dictate the method of valuation to be employed.  The statute reflects the Legislature's attempt to protect the property owner's right to just compensation by allowing Supreme Court to use methods other than income capitalization while simultaneously providing the condemnor with an avenue of escape in case of an unusually high valuation. Although the income capitalization method, which seeks to set the value of property based on its expected net yield to the owner, has become the preferred approach in valuating income-producing property, it remains subject to criticism, principally because of the speculative nature of the valuation criteria used, and because earned income imperfectly reflects the actual value of a utility whose rates are subject to regulation. Supreme Court retains its appropriate power in the legislative scheme, as it determines in the first instance whether income capitalization is to be utilized, and the unusual solution chosen by the Legislature is constitutionally tolerable given the unique valuation problems inherent in public utilities takings.  Furthermore, section 1199-eee (5) affects public utilities only; because compensation for condemnation of the nonutility petitioners' property is governed by the provisions of the EDPL, rather than section 1199-eee (5), the challenged statute in no way infringes on their constitutional right to receive just compensation.  </SPAN></P>

The statute abrogates the general rule that no taking occurs under the statute until title vests to the extent of chronologically separating the &quot;taking&quot; or &quot;acquisition&quot; event from the vesting of title. Pursuant to EDPL article 4, respondent takes possession of the property at the end of the acquisition proceeding upon the filing of an acquisition map, and valuation takes place as of that date.  Title vests later under section 1199-eee (5), when the appeals process is exhausted, in order that the condemnor may be able to withdraw the proceeding in the event Supreme Court determines income capitalization should not be used, and in order to comply with the settled rule that a condemnor cannot abandon an appropriation after title vests. Inasmuch as valuation takes place as of the time of the taking, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order upholding defendant's conviction for assault in the third degree and resisting arrest. The appellate division had vacated defendant's two second-degree assault convictions, holding that police unlawfully seized defendant by detaining him without a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The illegality of the seizure negated a necessary element of second-degree assault. Defendant claimed that substantive due process barred convicting him for actions in direct response to the illegal seizure and that, because the police acted unlawfully, defendant's arrest was not authorized, negating an element of resisting arrest. The court held that defendant failed to preserve for review his claim that substantive due process barred convicting him for his response to the seizure. Also, the court held that defendant did not timely request a jury instruction that he would have been justified in using force in self-defense against excessive force employed by the police to detain him. Defendant's third-degree assault against an officer, during his initial encounter with his police, furnished the predicate for defendant's subsequent authorized arrest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendant for assault and resisting arrest stemming from an incident which began when police officers detained defendant by blocking his vehicle and displaying their weapons without having any reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot at the time, defendant has failed to preserve for appellate review his contention, raised for the first time before the Appellate Division, that substantive due process bars convicting him for actions in direct response to the unlawful seizure of his person by the police.  Defendant's objection does not fall within the narrow class of cases in which preservation by timely objection has been held unnecessary; such exceptions have been limited to errors going to the very organization of the court or at such basic variance with the mode of procedure mandated by law that they impair the essential validity of the criminal proceedings, and the preservation rule has been generally applied to due process objections of the type raised here.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant was also convicted of assault in the third degree based upon the jury's finding that one officer was injured by contact with defendant's car during the initial encounter as a result of defendant's reckless conduct in maneuvering his automobile to avoid being detained by the officers, and there is no issue properly before the Court of Appeals of defendant's justification for his use of force in this initial encounter with the police.  Therefore, defendant's commission of an assault against one officer during the initial encounter between defendant and the police furnished the predicate for his subsequent authorized arrest by the second officer, and his conviction for resisting that arrest was properly affirmed by the Appellate Division.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A parolee killed a police officer and wounded two others and claimants brought an action against the State of New York for wrongfully allowing the assailant to remain on parole. The action was dismissed for failure to state a claim and, while an appeal was pending, the legislature enacted N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 205-e to establish a claim for police officers injured in the line of duty. After the appellate division affirmed the dismissal, &sect; 205-e was twice amended to expressly make the remedy retroactive and broaden the scope of coverage. The appellate division granted reargument, reversed the dismissal, and certified the question whether reversal was proper. The court answered the question in the affirmative and affirmed. The legislative waiver of immunity expressed in &sect; 205-e rested on an adequate moral obligation and did not violate the no-gift provision of N.Y. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8 because it did not grant a judgment or bestow a gift of state property but merely allowed the claimants an opportunity to seek redress. The legislature had directed reexamination and determination of a judgment not on the merits without impairing the state's right to defend itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A claim against the State to recover for injuries and wrongful death arising out of the 1984 shooting of three police officers by a parolee should be permitted to go forward in the Court of Claims.  While the first series of this litigation ended with the claims ruled out of court, the Legislature, in enactments reactive to the court rulings, persisted in trying to allow the claims to be heard in the Court of Claims, and the State challenges the authority and power of the Legislature to enact chapter 474 of the Laws of 1992, which purports to allow the claims pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e to be pressed retroactively. When the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal in the first round of litigation, the Legislature did not become forever barred from exercising its substantial powers, including that of surrendering some of the State's own vested rights with respect to the matter.  A Court of Appeals denial of leave to appeal from an order of the Appellate Division affirming a grant by the Court of Claims of defendant's motion to dismiss by way of summary judgment is a final determination; while the first series of litigation is thus deemed to be a final determination which created some vested rights in the State with respect to the matter at issue, the Appellate Division in the first series of litigation did not reach the question of the statute's application to this case.  General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e allowed for an existing cause of action which the courts in the first series of litigation found to be not available in the circumstances of and at that time; therefore, the claim was not extinguished and was ripe for express reopener by way of judicial determination under the ensuing legislation at chapter 762 of the Laws of 1990, which would allow judicial resolution of the claims.  It purposefully clarified the original intent of the Legislature to make General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e retroactive; thus, the defendant State cannot plausibly maintain that the Legislature did not intend to give retroactive application to the remedies provided for in General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e with respect to claimants who had litigated claims to final judgment before the amendments were enacted.  </SPAN></P>

While that power is not absolute and is constitutionally circumscribed, when the Legislature finds and demonstrates, as here, that there is an adequate moral obligation as the basis for retroactively remedying the particular restrictions of General Municipal Law &sect; 205-e, which otherwise barred the statutory claims advanced by claimants, the Legislature's power and exercise of that public policy choice should not be nullified by the courts.  The New York Constitution specifically forbids the gift or loan of property to a specific individual (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8), and when the Legislature demonstrates that an enactment challenged under this provision was both in response to a moral obligation of the State and does not undermine previously vested rights, the courts will not interfere with the exertion.  The Legislature has found that the nature of modern police work has exposed police officers to an unprecedented risk of death and physical injury, and the resultant revival of claims of injured officers and representatives of deceased officers against individuals found liable for such deaths or injuries did not grant judgment or bestow a direct, tangible gift of any forbidden State property; the claimants are allowed a lower order of entitlement--an opportunity to prove that the State was negligent in a special context and in recognition of a moral obligation. </SPAN></P>

While the State has advanced the argument that a violation of due process as against its own interests occurred by the Legislature, in effect, overriding the State's own vested rights, the Attorney-General is under a paramount duty to defend legislative action in enacting statutes; the State which enacted legislation may not be heard to complain that the enactment is void as a violation of due process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature designated DHCR the sole administrative agency to administer the regulation of residential rents under the rent control and rent stabilization statutes and to amend the Rent Stabilization Code. Property owners sought a preliminary injunction and a declaration that the new regulations were unconstitutional and invalid, in defining the persons to be afforded noneviction protection. The court held that DHCR acted within its competence and authority. The court held that owner's right to evict a tenant or convert property to other uses remained unaffected, and the fact that a tenancy might be of indefinite duration did not, without more, render it a permanent physical occupation of property. The court held that owners failed to establish their claim that, facially, a permanent physical occupation of owners' property had been taken. The court concluded that owners did not meet their burden of showing the requisite deprivation of economically beneficial use of their property.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Regulations promulgated by respondent Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) enlarging, beyond blood or marriage, the class of &quot;family members&quot; entitled to succeed to a rent-regulated apartment on the death or departure of the tenant of record to include any other person residing with the tenant who can prove emotional and financial commitment and interdependence between such person and the tenant (9 NYCRR 2104.6 [d] [3] [i]; 2204.6 [d] [3] [i]; 2500.2 [n]; 2503.5 [d]; 2520.6 [o] [2]; 2523.5 [b]) are within the agency's rule-making authority.  In defining the persons to be afforded noneviction protection in an ongoing housing crisis, DHCR has acted within its competence and authority.  DHCR has not acted on a clean slate--noneviction protection in rent-regulated housing was first created by the legislature in the rent control and rent stabilization laws.  Further, the challenged regulations fill in the interstices of the legislative mandate by redefining the protected class of people to include those who, in DHCR's experience as sole administrator of residential rent regulation and adjudicator of eviction disputes, are most in need of protection against loss of their homes in a continuing housing emergency. Nor has DHCR enacted categorical exemptions reflecting accommodations to special interest groups.  Moreover, although 27 bills have been introduced in the legislature between 1986 and 1989 relating t succession rights, the legislature has not sought to alter succession rights in the years following DHCR's emergency and later permanent regulations enlarging the class of &quot;family members&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

Regulations promulgated by respondent Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) enlarging, beyond blood or marriage, the class of &quot;family members&quot; entitled to succeed to a rent-regulated apartment on the death or departure of the tenant of record (9 NYCRR 2104.6 [d] [3] [i]; 2204.6 [d] [3] [i]; 2500.2 [n]; 2503.5 [d]; 2520.6 [o] [2]; 2523.5 [b]) are not unconstitutional on their face because, without just compensation, they require owners of rent-regulated housing to suffer a permanent physical occupation of their property.  The new regulations have not created perpetual tenancies. That a rent-regulated tenancy might itself be of indefinite duration does not, without more, render it a permanent physical occupation of property.  Nor does the fact that an owner must offer a renewal lease to a departed tenant's newly defined family member--potentially a stranger to the owner--give rise to such a physical occupation.  Because the challenged regulations may require the owner-lessor to accept a new occupant but not a new use of its rent-regulated property, the claim that, facially, a permanent physical occupation of property has been effected, has not been established.  In any event, a &quot;family member&quot; for noneviction purposes, applying all of the criteria established by DHCR, is no more likely to be a stranger to the owner than a family member as formerly defined.  </SPAN></P>

The challenged regulations do not affect the owner's right to receive the regulated rents, unchallenged as a reasonable return, and the owners are not deprived of their reversionary interest since the tenancies are not perpetual.  Thus, the owners have not met their burden of showing the requisite deprivation of economically beneficial use of their property.  </SPAN></P>

There is a close causal nexus between the challenged regulations and the stated purpose of preventing the eviction and resulting vulnerability to homelessness of the intended beneficiaries.  People who would, absent the regulations, be threatened with eviction from their homes may now have the right to remain.  The designation of classes of individuals to whom DHCR has extended noneviction protection is a matter that falls within the agency's expertise.  </SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's determination that the evidence did not warrant a drug factory presumption charge under the statute.

The Appellate Division was not presented with the problem of evaluating a trial error and the likelihood that it may have contributed to a result known to have been reached by the jury.  Here, the result reached by the jury was unknown, and the unknown aspect of the verdict involved the identity and legality of the theory that the jury chose for its verdict, not the tainting effect of some trial error on a known result.  Where it is impossible for a reviewing court to determine whether the guilty verdict was founded on an illegal theory, it may not review the evidence under a harmless error analysis and, in effect, assume the jury's fact-finding function by concluding that the jury must have reached its result on some alternative legal ground.  </SPAN></P>

Under the improper &quot;drug factory&quot; presumption charge as given by the court here, there was evidence to support a verdict on that erroneous theory.

Moreover, as to the statutory requirement that a person be in &quot;close proximity&quot; to the drugs, the trial court's charge that &quot;close proximity does not necessarily mean the same room where the drugs are found, so long as this room is either adjacent to or could be observed from the room that the person is located&quot;, made the presumption applicable to anyone present in the apartment when the warrant was executed.  Finally, there was nothing in the charge restricting the evidence of observations or activities--either as to nature or time of occurrence--that the jury could consider as constituting &quot;circumstances evincing an intent to unlawfully mix, compound, package or otherwise prepare for sale such controlled substance&quot;.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indigent mother's third noncustodial child lived with his grandmother. The county commissioner filed a petition for support against the mother on behalf of the grandmother. The appellate division affirmed the family court's decision against the commissioner and directed an award of nothing in child support because the mother's annual income was $ 0, and concluded that the Federal Child Support Enforcement Act prohibited a state from creating a conclusive presumption that $ 25 was the correct amount of child support to be awarded. The commissioner and intervenor state attorney general appealed on constitutional grounds alleging that &sect; 413(1)(g) of the New York Family Court Act, which conclusively fixed a minimum $ 25 per month floor in all cases, was not preemptively nullified by any conflict with federal law under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 667, which mandated a rebuttable presumption in all such instances. The court affirmed the determination of both lower courts in favor of the mother because the state act flatly contradicted the enabling legislation, which commanded an opportunity to rebut and drop the support award floor to $ 0, where impoverished conditions so warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents filed a federal class action alleging that the apportionment voting composition set by defendant county supervisors violated the equal protection and due process rights of county residents, by not providing substantially equal weight for voters, due to the inclusion in the apportionment base of transients, such as military personnel, incarcerated felons, and occupants of group homes. The lower court granted summary judgment to defendants and dismissed the complaint. On appeal to the intermediate federal appellate court, the following question was certified to this court: whether, for purposes of local legislative apportionment, &quot;population&quot;, defined as &quot;residents, citizens, or registered voters&quot; in New York Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10(1)(ii)(a)(13)(c), necessarily excluded transients, such as military personnel, incarcerated felons, and occupants of group homes. The court answered the question in the negative. It held that &quot;residents&quot; in the apportionment sense was construed more broadly then would be appropriate in terms of voting rights.

The employees had claimed that a legislative change in funding their pension was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1990 N.Y. Laws 210, changed the method of funding the civil service employees' pension plan from an aggregated cost method, which resulted in the funding of some benefits before they accrued, to another method, which required funding only when the benefits accrued. The net result was a cost savings for the state because it would pay a reduced annual contribution for a number of years. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, which had held that 1990 N.Y. Laws 210 violated the state constitution. N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 7 provided that membership in the civil service employees pension constituted a contractual relationship, the benefits of which could not be impaired or diminished. The funding change in 1990 N.Y. Laws 210 radically impacted the pension and clearly impaired and diminished its value. The comptroller was a trustee of the fund, and was bound by the constitutional prohibition against reducing its value. Thus, his independent judgment on investment was to be protected. The court held that the legislature was bound by a fiduciary with respect to the administration with the fund, even though it had been given flexibility with respect to its administration.</SPAN></P>

Chapter 210 divests the State Comptroller, as trustee of the subject retirement funds, of his autonomous judgment as to whether the PUC method is preferable to the AC method.  Said legislation allows employers to deplete moneys in the existing pension fund by reducing the amount of employer contributions.  Employers are allowed a credit of a portion of the existing moneys, and need not contribute to the pension until the reserved moneys are drastically reduced.  To later replenish the fund, employers and employees must increase the amount of their contributions to the pension fund. As such, the reserve moneys will not be available for immediate investment, the return on investment of moneys in the existing fund will be significantly decreased, and the additional security provided by the reserve moneys in the pension funds will be impaired. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant building owner commenced an action against respondents, a city, its preservation commission, and various officials, which alleged that the commission exceeded its authority under the Landmarks Law (Law), New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code tit. 25, ch. 3. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action. The building owner appealed that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preservation commission landmarked the interior of a restaurant located in an office building. That action was challenged by the building owner on the grounds that it exceeded the authority granted to the commission by the Law, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code tit. 25, ch. 3. The court found that the actions of the commission were consistent with the authority granted to it by the Law. The commission was authorized by two provisions of the Law, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 25- 302(m), &sect; 25-303(a)(2), to landmark an interior 30 or more years old that was customarily open or accessible to the public. Under those provisions, there was no requirement that the interior be a place of assemblage like a railroad station or a theater. Rather, it only had to a place to which the public was customarily invited. Moreover, another provision of the Law, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 25-302(1), did not distinguish between personalty and realty. Thus, the commission's designation of items appurtenant to the restaurant's interior was authorized. Furthermore, the mere fact that the restaurant could be converted to private use in the future did not preclude the commission's actions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks Preservation - Standard of Judicial Review - Determination of &quot;Special Historical or Aesthetic Interest&quot; With respect to judicial review of interior landmarking determinations of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, courts should defer to the expertise of the Commission as to interpretation of the statutory term &quot;special historical or aesthetic interest&quot; (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 25-302 [m]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks Preservation - Standard of Judicial Review - Determination of Customary Public Openness With respect to judicial review of interior landmarking determinations of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the meaning of &quot;customarily open or accessible to the public&quot; (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 25-302 [m])--essential to the Commission's jurisdiction--is a law question for the courts rather than one of administrative expertise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks Preservation - Owner's Consent The New York City Landmarks Law (Administrative Code of City of NY, tit 25, ch 3) does not require an owner's consent as a prerequisite to designation. The owner is entitled to notice of the public hearing (Administrative Code &sect; 25-313 [a]), but failure to give such notice does not invalidate a designation. So long as the statutory criteria are satisfied, the Landmarks Preservation Commission may make a valid designation over an owner's objection.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks Preservation - Interior of Restaurant - Customary Public Openness An interior to which the general public is usually invited, regardless of its intended purpose, falls within the ambit of the New York City Landmarks Law which requires as a threshold to landmark designation that an interior be &quot;customarily open or accessible to the public, or [a place] to which the public is customarily invited&quot; (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 25-302 [m]).  That an interior currently open to the public can be converted to private use in the future cannot preclude the landmarking of an appropriate interior. Thus, a determination of the Landmarks Preservation Commission that the Four Seasons restaurant &quot;customarily&quot; invites the public for purposes of landmarking the restaurant's interior is not arbitrary or capricious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks Preservation - Interior of Restaurant - Restriction on Future Use In a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging a determination of the Landmarks Preservation Commission designating the interior of the Four Seasons restaurant a landmark, appellant owner's argument that the designation impermissibly restricts future use of the space in violation of Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 25-304 (a), because it includes certain items that purportedly render the space unusable for any other purpose is rejected.  Whether or not the statute should be so read, appellant failed to establish its contention that the space will be unusable for other purposes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations - Landmarks Preservation - Interior of Restaurant - Items Appurtenant to Interior Items appurtenant to the interior of a restaurant designated as a landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission can properly be included in the designation notwithstanding that they fail to qualify as fixtures at common law.  Accordingly, in designating the interior of the Four Seasons restaurant as a landmark, the Commission properly included hanging sculptures, a walnut bar, metal draperies, decorative metal railings and ceiling panels that were created and installed at the architect's direction, finding that each of the designated items was an integral element of the design of the interior. The Commission has drawn a rational distinction between items integral to the design of the interior space, and items that merely enhance the restaurant's ambiance.  The Commission's interpretation is not unreasonable and thus the Commission did not exceed its authority by including the designated items.  Moreover, the Commission's decision to include the designated items is supported by the record and not arbitrary or capricious and thus was within the proper exercise of the Commission's discretion.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections - Redistricting Plan - New York City Districting Commission - Use of Census Tabulation Blocks The policy choice of the New York City Districting Commission not to split census tabulation blocks in redrawing New York City Council districts is not arbitrary and capricious. The Commission was required to use the &quot;final count results&quot; of the 1990 census (NY City Charter &sect; 1152 [d] [11] [b]), and determined that it could best effectuate this mandate by building districts from tabulation blocks, the smallest geographical units for which census data was available.  The Commission's policy choice not to split tabulation blocks was directly and reasonably related to implementing the Charter's requirement that census data be used in creating districts.  Accordingly, the petition is dismissed in a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging, as violative of the Charter's intact-neighborhoods requirement (NY City Charter &sect; 52 [1] [c]), the decision of the Commission to place the whole of census tabulation block 105, a portion of which allegedly has historically been a part of the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, into a different district than Brooklyn Heights in order to create a Latino-majority district pursuant to the districting plan's second-ranked priority of ensuring fair and effective minority representation (NY City Charter &sect; 52 [1] [b]), rather than placing the disputed portion of census block 105 in the district encompassing Brooklyn Heights.  </SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 524.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 1987 N.Y. Laws ch. 524, which created the library district, the town must levy a tax to fund the library district in an amount fixed by the trustees of the library district. On appeal, the town contended that the statute violated the New York Constitution. The court agreed, concluding that the statute improperly delegated the power to tax. The court noted that although a complicated formula determined the actual amount the town must raise, the library trustees controlled the end result and thus effectively set the tax rate for the town. Thus, there was a delegation of taxing power to the library district. The state legislature has the sole power to tax. N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1; art. XVI, &sect; 1. This power could be delegated to legislative bodies of municipalities and quasi-municipal corporations, but not to administrative agencies or other governmental departments. Special library districts are most like public improvement districts. Their function is to provide a mechanism for creating and funding library systems similar to those authorized under N.Y. Educ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws of 1987 (ch 524), which created the Greater Poughkeepsie Library District and requires the City of Poughkeepsie and the Town of Poughkeepsie to levy a tax to fund the Library District in an amount fixed by the trustees of the Library District, improperly delegates the power to tax (NY Const, art III, &sect; 1; art XVI, &sect; 1) and is, therefore, violative of the State Constitution.  There is a delegation of taxing power to the Library District because the library trustees control two of the three variables that dictate the amount of the Library District's budget that the Town must fund; thus, the library trustees effectively set the tax rate for the Town.  Although the taxing power may be delegated to legislative bodies of municipalities and quasi-municipal corporations, it may not be delegated to administrative agencies or other governmental departments.  The function of special library districts is to provide a mechanism for creating and funding library systems; they cannot be created as full-blown independent governmental units and are properly viewed as administrative departments.  Moreover, the statute at issue contains none of the hallmarks of accountability associated with the power to tax and is, therefore, contrary to the policy that underlies the taxation power: broad discretion granted to the Legislature, moderated by accountability to the electorate. </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs alleged that the statute, which established a separate public school district in and for a religious community, violated the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. The lower court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on state and federal constitutional grounds. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed the judgment for plaintiffs on federal constitutional grounds only. The court held that the statute violated the second prong of the Lemon test because its principal effect was to advance religion. The court found that the statute conveyed a message of government endorsement of religion because it authorized a religious community to dictate where secular public educational services should be provided to the children of the community and created a type of symbolic impact. The court determined that only children of that religious community would attend the public schools in the newly established district and that only members of that religious community would likely serve on the school board.</SPAN></P>

The symbolic union of church and State effected by the establishment of the Kiryas Joel Village School District under Laws of 1989 (ch 748) is sufficiently likely to be perceived by the Satmarer Hasidim as an endorsement of their religious choices, or by nonadherents as a disapproval of their individual religious choices.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superintendent selection process established by New York City's public schools chancellor (Special Circular No. 37) does not impermissibly interfere with the statutory power of local community schools to employ a community superintendent. Special Circular No. 37 requires each community school board to develop, and approve at a public meeting, the procedure by which its superintendent will be selected, requires each board to prepare and submit to the chancellor a comprehensive evaluation of each finalist measured against detailed educational, managerial and administrative criteria set forth in the circular, for the chancellor's assessment of the selection process and the issuance of appropriate directives, and requires that, if the board is considering renewal of an incumbent superintendent's contract, a summary of the district's parents' views be submitted to the chancellor in addition to the board's evaluation.  As a matter of statutory interpretation the community boards' hiring practices must conform to the city board's policies </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Education Law &sect; 2590-e).  Although a policy that eviscerates a community board's enumerated power to hire a superintendent would not comport with legislative intent underlying the Decentralization Law (Education Law art 52-A), and particular vigilance must be paid to assuring sufficient autonomy by community boards in this respect, neither the concept nor the specific terms of Special Circular No. 37 significantly intrude upon the community boards' power to employ a superintendent. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding against respondent comptroller, alleging that the comptroller improperly withheld money from each of her paychecks as a method of recouping wages paid to her when, allegedly, she was not on the job. The trial court entered judgment in part in the employee's favor, and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) reversed. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues on appeal were whether the comptroller was invested by statute or common-law right or both with a unilateral wages recoupment power and whether statutory or common-law procedural safeguards in the exertion of such power were met. The court held that while the comptroller had broad and important powers, the procedure he used in this matter was seriously flawed in that no tribunal was convened, no witnesses were sworn, no testimony was taken by anyone, no arbitration was conducted, and no contract was relied upon. Furthermore, the procedure suffered from the absence of any judicial action or legislative approval, and the comptroller sought none. The court held also that the Suffolk County Charter offered no authority for the comptroller's unilateral action in the case. The court concluded that statutory and common-law recoupment powers of the comptroller did not extend to the unilateral design and execution of a wage withholding regime to recoup purported salary overpayments under circumstances such as these when the basis for and amounts of the overpayments were never reduced to an established debt and when the county charter procedural rubrics had been ignored.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statutory and common-law recoupment powers of the Suffolk County Comptroller do not extend to the unilateral design and execution of a wage withholding regime to recoup purported salary overpayments when the basis for and amounts of the overpayments were never reduced to an established debt and when County Charter procedural rubrics have been ignored or bypassed.  Thus, respondent Suffolk County Comptroller was not authorized to unilaterally withhold 10% from each of petitioner County employee's current paychecks as a method of recouping wages estimated by the Comptroller's audit to have been paid to petitioner when, allegedly, she was not on the job.  Simply &quot;deeming&quot; or estimating the amount of an alleged past debt by a unilateral audit and ukase is unwarranted.  That petitioner was afforded the opportunity to submit evidence of her work attendance to the Comptroller and attended conferences with and submitted documentation to him in an attempt to resolve the matter prior to the issuance of the disputed audit does not constitute the establishment of a genuine debt or provide sufficient procedural protection before allowing the Comptroller to unilaterally initiate this recoupment remedy.  Moreover, the Suffolk County Charter offers no authority for the Comptroller's unilateral recoupment actions in this case; rather, the County Charter specifies a different regimen for the use of audits, which was not followed.  </SPAN></P>

Although the challenged regulations are designed to prevent the avoidance of State taxes by non-Indians who purchase untaxed cigarettes from Indian retailers, and the incidence of the sales tax is intended to be borne by the ultimate non-Indian consumer, the tax provisions nevertheless regulate, to a significant degree, trade between wholesale distributors and their Indian purchasers, an area preempted by Federal law.  Accordingly, the tax regulations cannot be applied to cigarette wholesale dealers involved in trading with Indians on reservations located in New York State.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citizens challenged state financing schemes embodied in 1990 N.Y. Laws 190 (Act). In a separate action, citizens sought to invalidate various sections of chapter 220 of the Act establishing a local government assistance corporation for the issuance of bonds. The supreme court and the appellate division dismissed both proceedings for a lack of standing. On appeal, the court held that the citizens in the first action had standing because they expressly asserted a claim to standing as voters in their primary pleading. However, the equitable doctrine of laches applied, thereby barring the action, because the effect of the citizens' delay in challenging the legislation prejudiced the city. With respect to the second action, the court held that the citizens did not have standing to sue because they did not assert standing as voters in their primary proceeding, and therefore, a substantial constitutional question was not directly involved.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, a group of citizens, have standing on a constitutional voter basis to challenge sections of Laws of 1990 (ch 190) which deal with the extension of State credit and long-term debt without voter approval, because the express voter referendum requirement to incur debt contained in NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 11 is inextricably linked to the constitutional grant of debt-incurring authority.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although plaintiffs, a group of citizens, have constitutional voter standing to challenge sections of Laws of 1990 (ch 190) which deal with the extension of State credit and long-term debt without voter approval, their proceeding is nevertheless barred because the commencement of the litigation does not satisfy the equitable laches doctrine in the particular context and circumstances of the case.  The challenged legislation was signed into law on May 25, 1990, and plaintiffs' proceeding was not commenced until April 29, 1991.  During that time, in reliance on the presumed constitutionality and regularity of chapter 190, a total of $ 377,326,674 in bonds were issued and sold to investors, the sales of State properties contemplated by the legislation were completed, various other nonbond transactions were also carried out, and proceeds of $ 200 million and $ 20 million, respectively, were deposited in the Capital Projects Fund and General Fund.  The time periods involved here do not meet the threshold test for avoiding application of the laches doctrine in light of the great prejudice certain to be inflicted on the State and its citizens at large when financial transactions of such magnitude and destabilizing impact are at stake and may be upset.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged evidentiary rulings of the trial court. The court found that the record supplied a sufficient analysis of the rape shield law's interests of justice exception for statutory and constitutional validity. While the offer of proof and judicial explanation of why the shield law barred the introduction of he evidence were very limited, defense counsel had a fair opportunity to describe the proposed evidence, but they failed to explain its relevance. The court adequately gave notice as to why the evidence was disallowed. Counsel failed to show the probative value of the evidence sought to be admitted. The prosecution did not fail to satisfy its burden of showing that the victim did not consent to the sex acts because defendants alleged coercive acts created an inference that the sexual contact was forcible. The crime was a general intent crime, and the court found the instructions given adequately covered the defense theory regarding mistake of fact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Evidence - &quot;Rape Shield Law&quot; - Interest of Justice Exception - Adequacy of Procedure Employed in Rejecting Offer of Proof </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendants for rape and sodomy, the trial court, in applying the &quot;rape shield law&quot; (CPL 60.42) to deny defendants' application to introduce evidence purportedly showing that the victim had previously engaged in group sex, did not deny them their minimal statutory right under CPL 60.42 (5) to make an offer of proof, where defense counsel was twice given an opportunity to summarize the proposed evidence and explain its relevance without restriction by the court, and, after doing so and asking the court to rule, the court rejected the offer of proof and gave an explanation for its ruling.  CPL 60.42 (5) requires only that the trial court hear an &quot;offer of proof&quot; and provide a statement of its findings of fact essential to its determination, and both procedural requirements were met here.  Although the court might better have commented on the specific proffer and explained why the &quot;interest of justice&quot; exception was inapplicable under the circumstances of the case, its statement adequately put defendants on notice of its reasoning and created a record for appeal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Evidence - &quot;Rape Shield Law&quot; - Due Process of Law - Federal Constitutional Rights to Present Evidence and Cross-Examine Witnesses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the prosecution of defendants for rape and sodomy, the proceedings underlying the trial court's application of the &quot;rape shield law&quot; (CPL 60.42) to deny their application to introduce evidence purportedly showing that the victim had previously engaged in group sex, were not so limited that they violated due process and arbitrarily deprived defendants of their Federal constitutional rights to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses in their own defense.  The burden for making a threshold showing of relevance rested on the defense as the moving party.  There is nothing arbitrary about a trial court requiring a sensible proffer as part of a motion under CPL 60.42 and refusing to proceed to a more elaborate airing of the evidence in the absence of one.  Here, counsel gave no explanation of why the evidence was probative, and the Constitution does not compel a court to proceed to a fuller consideration of the evidence until the proponent demonstrates some basis for its admission.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Evidence - &quot;Rape Shield Law&quot; - Reconsideration of Ruling Rejecting Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the prosecution of defendants for rape and sodomy, the trial court was not required to reverse its determination under the &quot;rape shield law&quot; (CPL 60.42) denying defendants' application to introduce evidence purportedly showing that the victim had previously engaged in group sex, on the basis of a single remark from the People's summation which, for the first time on appeal to the Court of Appeals, defendants assert gave rise to a new theory of relevance for the evidence that previously was ruled inadmissible.  Defendants do not even allege that their alternate theory of relevance became apparent during either their case or the People's, the remark passed without objection or request for relief by defendants, and the new theory of admissibility remains unclear, even with the advantage of hindsight unavailable to the Trial Judge.  The trial court did not act arbitrarily when, in the absence of an objection, it failed to discern a nascent due process or Sixth Amendment violation in a rhetorical question contained in the People's summation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Instructions - Rape in First Degree - Sodomy in First Degree - Intent - Mistake of Fact </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In the prosecution of defendants for rape in the first degree and sodomy in the first degree, where the jury was instructed that the &quot;final element [the People must prove] is that the lack of [complainant's] consent resulted from the use of forcible compulsion [which] means to compel by either use of physical force, or a threat, express or implied, which places a person in fear of immediate death or physical injury to herself&quot;, the trial court did not commit reversible error in refusing to instruct the jury specifically on the mistake of fact defense and on intent as an element of first degree rape and sodomy. The defense theory was that the jury could reasonably have found from the evidence adduced at trial that defendants' mistaken belief as to complainant's consent to sexual relations negated the intent necessary for a finding of guilt on the various counts, i.e., the intent to forcibly compel another to engage in intercourse or sodomy. Manifestly, it is unnecessary to forcibly compel another to engage in sexual acts unless that person is an unwilling participant and, therefore, the jury by finding that defendants used forcible compulsion to coerce the victim to engage in sodomy and intercourse, necessarily found that defendants believed the victim did not consent.  Thus, the instructions given covered the defense theory, and the court did not commit reversible error in declining to give additional instructions on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">mens rea</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or mistake of fact. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the grant of a motion by respondent state to dismiss the complaint in a proceeding challenging the constitutionality of the bicameral recall procedure used by the legislature to reacquire an assembly bill from the governor's desk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By long standing practice, if the state legislature desired to retrieve from the governor a bill it had passed, the legislature simply asked and the governor complied. Assembly Bill No. 9592-A, was such a case. It was passed by the legislature and sent to the governor. The next day the legislature requested that the governor return the bill. The bill was returned on the same day. The citizens brought a combined N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 78 and declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that the method used by the legislature to retrieve the passed bill was unconstitutional, and that the passed bill automatically became law because the governor failed to act on it within 10 days of its delivery to his desk. The trial court dismissed the action and the appellate court modified to declare the recall practice constitutional. The court found the description in the constitution of the process to be a model of civic simplicity, either approval, rejection by veto, or approval by inaction. The court found the long-standing recall practice had little more than time and expediency to sustain it. The court found the practice unconstitutional, but gave it prospective application only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that to permit the legislature to use its general rule-making powers, pertaining to in-house procedures, to create this substantive authority was untenable and undermined the integrity of the law-making process, as well as the underlying rationale for the demarcation of authority and power in this process. The court reversed the lower court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislature - Recall Procedure - Return of Bill to Legislature Following Delivery to Governor - Constitutionality of Bicameral Recall Practice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The bicameral recall practice used by the Legislature to reacquire passed bills which have formally been sent to the Governor is unconstitutional.  New York Constitution, article IV, &sect; 7 expressly creates three routes by which a passed bill may become a law by gubernatorial action or inaction or be rejected by veto. Since the putative authority of the Legislature to recall a passed bill once it has been formally transmitted to the Governor is not found in the Constitution, the bicameral recall practice is not allowed under the Constitution.  The recall practice undermines the integrity of the law-making process as well as the underlying rationale for the demarcation of authority and power in this process.  Requiring that the Legislature adhere to the constitutional mandate ensures that the central law-making function remains reliable, consistent and exposed to civic scrutiny and involvement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Justiciable Questions - Bicameral Recall Practice Authorized by Internal Rules of Senate and Assembly </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Judicial Branch may review the question whether the bicameral recall practice, by which the Legislature reacquires passed bills which have formally been sent to the Governor, is constitutional under NY Constitution, article IV, &sect; 7, which prescribes how a bill becomes a law and explicitly allocates the distribution of authority and powers between the Executive and Legislative Branches.  The courts do not trespass into the wholly internal affairs of the Legislature when they review and enforce a clear and unambiguous constitutional regimen of this nature.  The internal rules of the Assembly and the Senate, which reflect and even purport to create the recall practice, are entitled to respect but cannot immunize or withdraw the subsisting question of constitutional law-making power from judicial review.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Prospective Effect of Declaration of Unconstitutionality - Bicameral Recall Practice </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a combined CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action wherein the Court of Appeals held unconstitutional the bicameral recall practice by which the Legislature reacquired Assembly Bill No. 9592-A of 1990 that had been passed and formally sent to the Governor, an order compelling the Secretary of State to execute a certificate that Assembly Bill No. 9592-A became law on or about July 30, 1990, because the Governor failed to act on it within 10 days of its delivery to his desk on July 19, 1990 is not warranted.  The recall practice has been in operation for over a century.  It is impossible to calculate how many, and which, bills would be affected by a ritualistic approach to the relief related to the Court's declaration that the recall practice is not constitutionally authorized.  In addition, despite the mitigation from the short four-month Statute of Limitations (CPLR 217), a retroactive ruling, or even a ruling with resuscitative effect, in the instant case would cause profoundly uncertain effects in particular and unwarranted disorder and confusion.  Thus, the bicameral recall practice should be declared unconstitutional prospectively from May 6, 1993, the date of the Court of Appeals decision, forward.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Police - Discipline of Police - Applicability of Exclusionary Rule in Disciplinary Proceeding against State Trooper </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Evidence consisting of a quantity of marihuana that was the product of an unlawful search by the Buffalo City Police, and was suppressed in a criminal prosecution of petitioner, a State Trooper, may be used in an administrative disciplinary proceeding commenced against petitioner by the Division of State Police.  The application and scope of the exclusionary rule is ascertained by balancing the foreseeable deterrent effect against the adverse impact of suppression upon the truth-finding process.  Here, the benefit to be gained from precluding police officers, who unlawfully possess controlled substances from making arrests--including arrests for drug-related offenses--clearly outweighs any deterrent effect that may arise from applying the exclusionary rule to preclude evidence unlawfully obtained by Buffalo City police officers and sought to be admitted by the Division of State Police in an administrative disciplinary proceeding. Moreover, since nothing in the record indicates that the Buffalo City Police were acting as agents of the Division of State Police, it cannot be said that the Division of State Police, in seeking to discipline petitioner for unlawful possession of marihuana, relied upon the unlawful and unconstitutional acts of its agents.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Police - Discipline of Police - Substantial Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A disciplinary determination that petitioner State Trooper knowingly possessed marihuana is supported by substantial evidence where a quantity of marihuana was seized from the console of an automobile in which petitioner and another man had been seated.  Substantial evidence means such relevant proof as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion or ultimate fact.  The presence of a controlled substance in an automobile is presumptive evidence of knowing possession thereof by each and every person in the automobile at the time such controlled substance was found (Penal Law &sect; 220.25 [1]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Police - Discipline of Police - Propriety of Penalty of Dismissal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The penalty of dismissal imposed upon petitioner, a State Trooper who was found to have knowingly possessed marihuana, is not so disproportionate to the offense, in light of all the circumstances, as to be shocking to one's sense of fairness.  </SPAN></P>

He received worker's compensation benefits from the employer, and under Missouri law, that precluded the employer from any other liability to any other person. The employee brought an action against the seller of the machine in New York. The seller brought a third-party action against the employer, manufacturer, and a company to seek contribution for any liability. Missouri law did not allow a contribution claim against the employer, but New York law did. The court found that Missouri law applied because although the interests of the respective jurisdictions were irreconcilable, the accident occurred in Missouri, and unavailability of contribution more closely comported with the reasonable expectations of both parties in conducting their business affairs. The court also found that the public policy exception that allowed a court to refuse to enforce a foreign law that was against public policy was inapplicable to the instant case because the seller had not sustained its heavy burden of proving that the Missouri statute was offensive to New York's public policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a products liability action against defendant, the initial sales agent of a machine, arising from injuries sustained by plaintiff employee, a Missouri resident, while he was cleaning the subject machine at his employer's Missouri plant, a Missouri workers' compensation statute barring contribution claims against an employer--which conflicts with New York law permitting such claims--should be given effect in a third-party action pending in New York in which defendant, a New York domiciliary, seeks contribution from plaintiff's employer, a Missouri domiciliary. Although the interests of the respective jurisdictions underlying these loss allocating statutes are irreconcilable, Missouri law should apply because the accident occurred in Missouri, and the unavailability of contribution would more closely comport with the reasonable expectations of both parties in conducting their business affairs.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a products liability action against defendant, the initial sales agent for the machine that injured plaintiff, a Missouri resident, while he was cleaning the machine at the Missouri plant where he was employed, application of New York law on the issue whether a contribution claim by the sales agent against plaintiff's employer is barred would not violate the Full Faith and Credit and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution (US Const, art IV, &sect; 1; 14th Amend, &sect; 1) since New York has, in the aggregate, sufficient contacts with the case.  Defendant has alleged that plaintiff's employer has a substantial presence in New York, and there is indication in the record that the employer does business in New York.  Additionally, defendant, which seeks contribution under New York law, is a domiciliary of New York.  Moreover, defendant's alleged tortious conduct with respect to the machine arose in New York, where the machine was ordered, operated for several years, and eventually shipped out-of-State.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflict of Laws - What Law Governs - Public Policy Exception </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. New York's interest in a case involving a New York domiciliary, who may be cast in liability by the effect of the Missouri workers' compensation statute which, contrary to New York law, bars contribution claims against employers, is sufficient to warrant scrutiny under the public policy exception pursuant to which a court may refuse to enforce an otherwise applicable foreign law when it would violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflict of Laws - What Law Governs - Public Policy Exception - New York Public Policy Not Bar to Application of Missouri Statute Prohibiting Contribution Claim against Employer </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. New York's public policy permitting contribution claims against an employer does not preclude application of the Missouri workers' compensation statute, which bars contribution claims against an employer, in a third-party action pending in New York in which defendant, a New York domiciliary, seeks contribution from plaintiff's employer, a Missouri domiciliary, in connection with an underlying products liability action. Under the public policy exception, when otherwise applicable foreign law would violate some fundamental principle of justice, some prevalent conception of good morals, some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal, the court may refuse to enforce it.  In this case, contribution is not a deeply rooted tradition of the common weal, having been introduced into New York law only relatively recently.  Moreover, availability of contribution is not invariably guaranteed.  Although defendant claims that being forced to pay more than its equitable share of plaintiff's damages is unfair, public policy is not measured by individual notions of expediency and fairness or by a showing that the foreign law is unreasonable or unwise.  Thus, defendant has not sustained its heavy burden of proving that the Missouri statute is offensive to New York's public policy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment convicting defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance and criminal possession of a weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. The inculpating evidence was discovered after police executed a warrant, issued upon information supplied by a confidential informant, authorizing a search of defendant's apartment. After his arrest, defendant sought to inspect the warrant and the supporting documents and requested a hearing to challenge the issuing judge's determination that probable cause for the search existed. The court denied discovery and, following an in camera suppression hearing, denied the motion to suppress. Defendant argued that a suppression procedure conducted without his participation violated his constitutional rights to due process of law and the effective assistance of counsel. The order was affirmed on appeal, because defendant's opportunity to participate in the suppression proceeding yielded to the need for confidentiality, to protect the informant's identity. Moreover, there was reliable evidence of probable cause to support the issuance of the warrant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Search Warrant - Confidential Informant - Propriety of Conducting Suppression Procedure without Participation of Defendant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where defendant moved to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant issued on the basis of information supplied by a confidential informant, challenging the sufficiency of the warrant application and claiming that the search was tainted because of a prior police contact, the court properly denied defendant discovery of the search warrant and its supporting documents and conducted the suppression hearing in camera without defendant's participation on the ground that disclosure of the informant's identity and/or statements could compromise the safety of the informant or the integrity of future investigations.  A defendant's interest in availing himself of the exclusionary rule may, in exceptional circumstances, be subordinated to safety precautions necessary to encourage citizens to participate in law enforcement.  Here, both the issuing Judge and the suppression court questioned the police officer affiant and the informant under oath, and concluded that there was probable cause for the search, that the police officer's affidavit was truthful and that there was an overriding need for confidentiality. Although defense counsel's affidavit in support of the motion to suppress also contained allegations that prior police activities tainted the search, the court found after sufficient inquiry and on sufficient evidence that there was no taint. Therefore, there is support in the record for the suppression court's findings and under the circumstances the procedures it followed did not offend due process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, couples that lived outside of New York but earned income within New York, challenged N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 601(d) and (e). The tax law called for the consideration of all income, whether or not earned in New York, for computation of the proper tax rate within New York. The trial court granted summary judgment to New York and the appellate court affirmed. On review, the court noted initially that legislative enactments enjoyed a presumption of constitutionality. Additionally, the court found the law well-settled that when the state levied taxes within its authority, property not itself taxable could be used as a measure of the tax imposed on property within the state and to do so was not a tax on foreign property. Thus, states could refer to nontaxable out-of-state assets in setting their rates for taxable assets. The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution, designed to place the citizens, including residents of each state, upon the same footing with citizens and residents of other states, so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those states are concerned, was not implicated by the administration of the tax law.</SPAN></P>

The subject matter here regulated is a tax on in-State income, which is within the jurisdiction of the State.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, Zoning Board of Appeals of the City of Mount Vernon (board), challenged a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which declared unconstitutional the definitions of &quot;boarding house&quot; and &quot;family&quot; in Mt. Vernon, N.Y., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 267-2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a not-for-profit corporation, proposed to build a congregate housing facility for the elderly. The facility would consist of two units in a two-family house. The board denied the corporation's application for a building permit, in part on the grounds that the proposed project would be a &quot;boarding house.&quot; On appeal, the court modified the order and excluded that part that declared the additional definition of &quot;family&quot; unconstitutional because that issue was not properly before the court inasmuch as the permit application did not involve the definition of &quot;family.&quot; As to the definition of &quot;boarding house,&quot; the court affirmed its facial unconstitutionality and held that the definition of &quot;boarding house&quot; was overbroad, invited arbitrary application, and lacked a rational relationship to legitimate goals. The definition of &quot;boarding house&quot; was so broad that it would have encompassed even a family consisting of a father, mother, and children in a rented house or apartment and did not serve the purpose for a reduction of parking and traffic problems, control of population density, and prevention of noise and disturbance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

Since by its own terms, the definition includes a family consisting of a father, mother and children in a rented house or apartment, and because the prohibition against a &quot;boarding house&quot; includes a family expressly permitted under the zoning ordinance's definition of &quot;family&quot;, the definition of &quot;boarding house&quot; is overbroad, thereby inviting arbitrary application.  Thus, the definition lacks a rational relationship to legitimate goals (i.e., reduction of parking and traffic problems, control of population density, prevention of noise and disturbance) and is facially unconstitutional. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal - Matters Reviewable - Issue Decided Prematurely </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to annul a determination of a zoning board of appeals denying petitioner's request for use and area variances, the issue of whether the zoning ordinance's definition of &quot;family&quot; is unconstitutional is not properly before the Court of Appeals for decision where the local building department denied petitioner's application for a building permit on the ground that the proposed use would be a prohibited &quot;boarding house&quot;, and the zoning board of appeals rejected petitioner's argument that the building department erred in classifying the use as a &quot;boarding house&quot;, since respondents never denied petitioner's application on the basis that the proposed project would not fall under the definition of &quot;family.&quot; Accordingly, inasmuch as respondents did not address the &quot;family&quot; issue, it was premature for Supreme Court to address the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance's definition of &quot;family&quot;; rather, the court should have sent the case back to respondents to pass on petitioner's alternative argument since the constitutionality of statutes ought not be decided except in an actual factual setting that makes such a decision necessary.  </SPAN></P>

The motion was denied and the dispositional order adjudicating appellant a juvenile delinquent was affirmed on appeal. The court affirmed the order of the appellate court holding that latent deficiencies in the accusatory instrument did not provide a ground for mandatory dismissal under N.Y. Fam. Ct.

Neither the statutes that established the criteria for accusatory instruments in juvenile delinquency proceedings nor their underlying policies suggested that an inquiry beyond the facial validity of the petition was necessary or appropriate.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Latent deficiencies in a juvenile delinquency petition that are revealed during the trial or hearing do not provide a ground for mandatory dismissal under Family Court Act &sect; 315.1 (1) (a).  Neither the statutes establishing the criteria for accusatory instruments in juvenile delinquency proceedings nor the policies underlying those statutes suggest that an inquiry beyond the facial validity of the petition is necessary or even appropriate.  Accordingly, where the juvenile delinquency petition against respondent was sufficient on its face under the standards set forth in Family Court Act &sect; 311.1 and 311.2, but during the fact-finding hearing it was revealed that the supporting deposition was hearsay because the complainant was not made aware of its precise contents before she signed it, respondent's midhearing motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was jurisdictionally deficient because it was supported in relevant part only by hearsay in violation of Family Court Act &sect; 311.2 (3) was properly denied. </SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as the claimed defect was not apparent from the face of the accusatory instrument, it was not the kind of nonwaivable &quot;jurisdictional flaw&quot; that the Court of Appeals may consider even in the absence of a timely objection. </SPAN></P>

In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, respondent's claim on his appeal from the Appellate Division order affirming Family Court's dispositional order that the supporting deposition was legally inadequate because the complainant was not made aware of its precise contents before she signed it, has not been waived and is properly before the Court of Appeals notwithstanding that respondent's contention concerns a latent rather than a facial defect since the claim was the subject of a motion to dismiss. </SPAN></P>

In a juvenile delinquency proceeding, the statement contained in complainant's supporting deposition which was edited and revised by the Assistant Corporation Counsel before it was transcribed, and was neither read by nor to the complainant before she signed it, constitutes hearsay. The deposition was nothing more than a statement written by a law enforcement officer reporting what he or she had been told by an eyewitness.  Although the complainant signed the deposition, she had never read--nor been read--its contents, and thus she never learned what the document actually said.  </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, a putative class of infant children of minor mothers residing with the mothers' parents, urged that the &quot;grandparent-deeming rule,&quot; N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 131-c (2), was out-and-out avoidance of the Legislature's constitutional responsibility. The trial court disagreed and upheld the statute, and the appellate division affirmed. On appeal, the court concluded that the rule fell within the ambit of permissible legislative discretion in defining the term &quot;needy.&quot; The court found that the assumption underlying the rule -- that there were economies of scale in rent, food, fuel and other expenses of a single, three-generation household -- was not unreasonable. Moreover, the rule applied to cash benefits only and was not a complete bar to public assistance in other forms, such as food stamps and Medicaid. The court determined that the Legislature exercised its discretion reasonably and that the Legislature's application of the rule was rationally related to the State's interest in assuring consistency between the AFDC and Home Relief programs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Social Services Law &sect; 131-c (2)--the &quot;grandparent-deeming&quot; rule--which requires that a portion of the income of a grandparent who resides in the same household as an infant grandchild and minor parent under the age of 18, be deemed available to the infant in determining the infant's eligibility for Home Relief payments, does not violate the State constitutional requirement for the provision of public assistance to the needy (NY Const, art XVII, &sect; 1), since the rule falls within the ambit of permissible legislative discretion in defining the term &quot;needy&quot;.  The rule is reasonable in that its conformance to the Federal Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 avoids risk to reimbursement, inequalities in treatment among program participants, and increased administrative costs.  Further, the assumption underlying the rule--that there are economies of scale in rent, food, fuel and other expenses of a single, three-generational household--is not unreasonable.  Nor is the assumption that grandparents residing in a family unit with their minor children will voluntarily share income with their infant grandchildren even though not legally obligated to do so. Moreover, the grandparent-deeming rule is not a complete bar to public assistance in forms other than cash benefits, and where available income still falls below the standard of need, the infant remains eligible for assistance.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Social Services Law &sect; 131-c (2)--the &quot;grandparent-deeming&quot; rule--which requires that a portion of the income of a grandparent who resides in the same dwelling unit as an infant grandchild and minor parent under the age of 18, be deemed available to the infant in determining the infant's eligibility for Home Relief payments, does not subject the infants of minor mothers to disparate treatment in violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions.  It is entirely reasonable for the Legislature to assume that grandparents will contribute to the support of infant grandchildren residing in their household, notwithstanding the absence of a legal obligation to do so.  Similarly, the fact that grandparent-deeming ceases for minor mothers between the ages of 18 and 21 parallels the reasonable assumption of Federal law that, after the mother turns 18, grandparents may be less willing to contribute to the support of their grandchildren, and will instead ask that the minor mothers assume greater responsibility for their infants. In addition, Social Services Law &sect; 131-c (2) furthers the State's legitimate goal of allocating limited public assistance resources to the neediest applicants.  Further, while the Federal Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 requires only that the rule be applied to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the Legislature's application of the rule to New York State benefits is rationally related to the State's interest in assuring consistency between the AFDC and Home Relief programs.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted a special traffic options program for driving while intoxicated (STOP-DWI) whereby a participating county could receive fines and forfeitures collected by courts within that county for alcohol-related driving offenses.

The counties sought a declaratory judgment that this provision violated N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The comptroller argued that the counties did not have standing because the revenues were state, not county, funds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father did not know that his ex-girlfriend was pregnant and had a baby until 10 months after the baby was adopted. The court denied the father's claim that the mother or the State had a duty to ensure he knew of the birth, and that their failure to do so denied him his constitutional rights. The court held that inasmuch as the father failed to take any steps to discover the pregnancy or the birth of the child before first asserting his parental interest 10 months after the adoption became final, he was neither entitled to notice nor was his consent to the adoption required. The court found that there was no concealment or fraud involved. The court held that promptness was measured in terms of the baby's life not by the onset of the father's awareness, and that the demand for promptness was a logical and necessary outgrowth of the state's legitimate interest in the child's need for early permanence and stability. The court held that the father's equal protection claim failed because the existence or nonexistence of a substantial relationship between parent and child was a relevant criterion in evaluating both the rights of the parent and the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, an unwed father, who was unaware of the pregnancy or the birth of his child until nearly 18 months after the child's birth, was neither entitled to notice nor was his consent to the adoption of his child required where he failed to take any steps to discover the pregnancy or the birth of the child before first asserting his parental interest 10 months after the adoption became final </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111-a [2]; &sect; 111 [1] [e]).  In determining whether an unwed father has created a liberty interest, the timing of the father's actions is the most significant element.  The biological father must promptly manifest his parental interest through action on his part; absent that, the biological link of the father is insufficient to create a constitutionally protected interest.  Here, petitioner's inaction was solely attributable to him and under the circumstances he is not entitled to the protections of constitutional due process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption - Notice to Putative Father - Consent - Unwed Father Who is Unaware of Conception or Birth of Child - Equal Protection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner, an unwed father, who was unaware of the pregnancy or birth of his child until 10 months after the child's adoption became final was not denied equal protection because the applicable statutes (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111-a [2]; &sect; 111 [1] [e]) did not require notice to one in his position or require his consent to the adoption. The Equal Protection Clause does not preclude the State from withholding the privilege of vetoing an adoption from an unwed father who has never come forward to participate in the rearing of his child.  That &quot;unknowing&quot; unwed fathers may be treated differently under the statute than other unwed fathers is not dispositive.  The equal protection inquiry focuses on whether the statute's relation to the State interests it is intended to promote is so tenuous that it lacks the rationality contemplated by the Fourteenth Amendment, and petitioner has not met the burden of showing a lack of rationality in either the notice or the consent provisions of New York law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01, under which they were arrested for publicly baring their breasts, was discriminatory on its face because it defined &quot;private parts&quot; of a woman's body, but not a man's body, as including a specific part of the breast. The court said it was well settled that the People had the burden of proving that there was an important government interest at stake and that the gender classification was substantially related to that interest. The court noted, however, the People made no attempt to demonstrate that the statute's discriminatory effect served an important governmental interest or that the classification was reasonably based. A presumptively constitutional statute could be upheld only if it had a rational basis, the court explained. Consequently, &sect; 245.01 was not to be applied to conduct of defendants that was noncommercial, and certainly not involving lewd exposure, the court concluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment overturning the dismissal of information charging defendants with public exposure of their breasts was reversed because the People failed to demonstrate that discriminatory effect of statute, which was directed only at females, served an important governmental interest or had a rational basis, and because defendants' conduct was neither commercial nor lewd.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendants arising from their conduct during a high- speed automobile chase when one defendant, a passenger in the vehicle driven by the other defendant, fired several gunshots at the pursuing police vehicle and also fired at a police officer manning a roadblock, the evidence supports the jury finding that the passenger was shooting at the police officers with intent to kill and was, therefore, sufficient to convict defendants of attempted murder. The passenger shot at the pursuing police vehicle several times, with at least one of his shots striking the area around the windshield of the vehicle, and he fired directly at the officer manning the roadblock. Moreover, the jury could reasonably find that the driver shared the passenger's intent to kill. The two exchanged words before the driver accelerated through a red light and, after ignoring the police officers' direction to pull over, proceeded to drive at a high rate of speed through the City streets to avoid arrest.  The driver maneuvered his automobile so as to enable the passenger to obtain a direct line of fire toward the pursuing police vehicle. Additionally, knowing that the passenger had been shooting at the pursuing police, the driver proceeded to drive the automobile directly toward a police roadblock, permitting the passenger to aim and fire his weapon at one police officer.  Based upon this, the jury could find that the passenger's actions in firing at the officers were not &quot;spontaneous&quot; or unanticipated by the driver, but that the defendants together had a concerted or planned use of the weapon to kill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Lesser Included Offense - Entitlement to Second Degree Attempted Assault Charge in Prosecution for Attempted Murder, First and Second Degrees </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the prosecution of defendants for attempted murder in the first and second degrees, arising from their conduct during a high-speed automobile chase when one defendant, a passenger in the vehicle driven by the other defendant, fired several gunshots at the pursuing police vehicle and also fired at a police officer manning a roadblock, the trial court erred by failing to charge the jury with respect to the lesser included offense of attempted assault in the second degree, since the jury could reasonably have found that defendants' purpose in having the passenger shoot at the police was to injure the police officers and cause them to terminate the chase. The passenger was shooting at a moving target approximately 50 feet away while traveling at high speeds and while both vehicles were frequently changing lanes.  The jury could believe that under those circumstances defendants intended to injure rather than to kill. It could have reasonably concluded that the passenger was aiming and shooting at the officers and their vehicle in order to distract the driver of the police vehicle so that he would lose control of the car, in order to hit some portion of the car, such as a windshield or tire, to cause a serious accident, or to hit the officers, but only to seriously injure and incapacitate them so that they would abort the pursuit.  Moreover, with respect to the defendant driver, a reasonable juror could find on this evidence that even if the passenger intended to kill, the driver did not share that intent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Appeal - Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review - Failure to Charge Lesser Included Offense </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the prosecution of defendants for attempted murder in the first and second degrees, one defendant's claim that the court erred in refusing to submit to the jury the lesser included offense of attempted assault in the second degree is unpreserved since that defendant did not join in his codefendant's requests to charge or in his exception to the court's failure to charge that lesser included offense.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Right to Counsel - &quot;Searching Inquiry&quot; with Respect to Knowing Waiver of Right Unnecessary Where Defendant Asks Only to Participate in Defense </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where a defendant asks only to participate in his defense there is no relinquishment of the right to counsel and no determination to represent one's self.  Consequently, there is no need for the court to conduct a searching inquiry to make sure that the defendant is aware of the potential disadvantages of giving up the fundamental right to counsel.  It is preferable for the trial court to alert defendant of the benefits of permitting a more experienced and objective person to handle the defense in its entirety before a request for limited participation is granted, but there is no legal requirement that the court conduct a searching inquiry to determine whether the defendant appreciates the risks of limited participation.  Accordingly, where the trial court granted the defendant's application to give his own summation but it did not relieve defense counsel of the responsibility of representation of his client nor prevent defense counsel from continuing to act as counsel by interjecting objections or supplementing the defendant's summation with one of his own, that court did not err in failing to ensure that defendant had made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel as is required when a defendant elects to proceed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pro se.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the voters' argument that the redistricting plan unconstitutionally fragmented counties throughout the state and created districts that were neither compact nor contiguous. Although the senate redistricting plan technically violated the express language of the state constitution, such violations were inevitable to comply with federal constitutional requirements. The U.S. Justice Department had already determined that the plan met the requirements of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973 et seq. Balancing the myriad requirements imposed by both the state and the federal constitutions was a function of the legislature. In performing that function, the legislature did not unduly undermine N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 4. The voters did not overcome the presumption of constitutionality that attached to the redistricting plan. In balancing state and federal requirements, the legislature complied with the state constitution as far as practicable and did not act in bad faith in approving the redistricting plan.</SPAN></P>

The presumption of constitutionality that attaches to the redistricting plan has not been overcome.

Notwithstanding that the Senate redistricting plan technically violates the express language of the State Constitution, more than enough evidence has been put forth to support the argument that any such violation was minimized and that the district lines were drawn as they were in order to comply with Federal statutory and constitutional requirements.  Although the Senate plan compromises the integrity of 23 counties, a detailed defense of the proposed plan has been presented that is grounded in a complex analysis of population trends and voting patterns, and the way in which both must be accommodated in order to comply with Federal requirements.  While the number of divided counties in the new plan and the four bi-county pairings are troubling, it is not appropriate for the Court of Appeals to substitute its evaluation of the relevant statistical data for that of the Legislature.  In balancing State and Federal requirements, the State Constitution has been complied with as far as practicable, and it cannot be concluded on this record that the Legislature acted in bad faith in approving this redistricting plan.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sought review of a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which dismissed a writ of habeas corpus concerning his challenge to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 500.10(17)(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an underlying criminal proceeding, relator sought to post a bail bond secured by several parcels of real property, the aggregate value of which was insufficient to satisfy the double equity requirement of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 500.10(17)(b). He contended that the requirement was unconstitutional but the lower court rejected his arguments. He then commenced a habeas corpus proceeding, renewing his constitutional arguments and seeking a reduction in bail. The court concluded that the double equity requirement was rationally based because of the vulnerable nature of the value of real property. It then rejected relator's equal protection argument, holding that he had failed to demonstrate any disproportionate impact on racial or ethnic minorities. Finally, the court disposed of relator's argument that his bail should be reduced, refusing to correct in habeas corpus an exercise in discretion that rested on a rational basis. The previous judgment was thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The distinction drawn in CPL 500.10 (17) between personal property and real property for the purpose of securing a bail bond is rational.  CPL 500.10 (17) (b) requires that for real property to be used as security, its net value must be at least twice the total amount of the undertaking, while CPL 500.10 (17) (a) provides that nonexempt personal property may be used as security if its net value is equal to or greater than the total amount of the undertaking.  The State has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the collateral posted for a secured bond is adequate.  For these purposes, treating personal property and real property differently is rational in view of the need for real property to have a value greater than the amount it is securing. The double equity requirement of CPL 500.10 (17) (b) is a reasonable means of ensuring the adequacy of the value of real property posted for a secured bond. </SPAN></P>

The only distinction drawn in the statute is between real property and personal property. Nor has there been any showing that the double equity requirement, which is applicable only to those who seek to use real property as security, has a disproportionate impact on racial or ethnic minorities or that the Legislature harbored any discriminatory intent. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenants sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed an order of the trial court which granted summary judgment to respondent building owners in an action in which respondents alleged that 1989 N.Y. Laws ch. 473, &sect; 1 violated the contracts clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant were nonpurchasing tenants in an apartment building that was being converted into a cooperative. Respondents were the owners of the building. In a previous lawsuit, the parties agreed to a consent judgment which enjoined respondents from evicting appellants until December 31, 1989. The legislature subsequently passed 1989 N.Y. Laws ch. 473, &sect; 1 which allowed appellants to remain in unsold units of the building after that date. The appellate division affirmed the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of respondents. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the law violated the contracts clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court recognized that a state law may impair a contractual relationship if it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose. The court held that the legislation involved an important public purpose, alleviating the New York City housing crisis and protecting New York City tenants, but the court held that the law, which benefited only appellants, was neither necessary nor reasonable to serve that purpose and that it impaired the prior consent judgment which was in the nature of a contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate division entered in favor of respondent owners.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Laws of 1989 (ch 473), which extends protection against eviction to nonpurchasing tenants currently in occupancy of apartment units in a particular cooperative apartment building, unconstitutionally impairs in violation of US Constitution, article I, &sect; 10 the contractual rights of plaintiffs, the owners and holders of the unsold shares and related proprietary leases in the cooperative, pursuant to a 1982 consent judgment which settled an action by the State Attorney-General under the Martin Act (General Business Law art 23-A) and provided that plaintiffs would be permitted to evict the remaining nonpurchasing tenants and sell the shares allocated to their apartments after December 31, 1989.  Inasmuch as the statute substantially if not completely destroyed plaintiffs' expectancy that they would be permitted to evict the remaining nonpurchasing tenants after December 31, 1989, the State law has impaired a preexisting contractual relationship. Moreover, although the Legislature invoked the New York City housing crisis as justification for enacting the statute, the statute is in reality drawn so restrictively as to benefit only a handful.  As a result, it cannot be said that the statute is either necessary or reasonable to serve the purpose identified in the statute, and it is, therefore, an unconstitutional impairment of the contract between the plaintiffs and the State.  </SPAN></P>

A 1982 consent judgment, which contains the terms of a settlement of an action by the Attorney-General against plaintiffs alleging violations of the Martin Act (General Business Law art 23-A) in connection with a cooperative conversion, is in the nature of a contractual obligation since it contains a number of promises that are supported by valid consideration, and is legally enforceable according to its terms.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Co-defendants appealed the orders of the Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court in the Second and Third Judicial Departments of New York.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A co-defendant was convicted of growing marijuana after a trespasser provided information to police and they entered his land without his knowledge or permission. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the open fields exception did not adequately protect co-defendant's fundamental constitutional rights and the court declined to adopt it as New York Law. Co-defendant's no trespassing signs indicated his expectation of privacy making the search warrant based upon illegal entries onto the property a nullity. The other co-defendant was charged with possession of stolen property after police conducting an administrative inspection of his business found stolen auto parts. A trial court granted co-defendant's motion to suppress but the appeals court reversed. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the warrantless search was unconstitutional as it was not supported by the exigency of hot pursuit or the existence of a business that was closely regulated. The court found that such administrative inspections were only valid if they were part of a comprehensive administrative program unrelated to the enforcement of criminal laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlawful Search and Seizure - Landowner's Constitutionally Protectible Interest in Land Outside Curtilage - Rejection of Oliver v United States under State Constitution </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The rule of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Oliver v United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (466 US 170) that a landowner has no constitutionally protectible interest in land outside the curtilage so as to permit the police to enter without a warrant regardless of steps taken to assure privacy and irrespective of the benign nature of the activities sought to be kept private, does not protect fundamental constitutional rights and, therefore, should not be adopted as the law of New York under NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 12.  Since the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Katz</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision in 1967 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Katz v United States,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 389 US 347), the New York State Court of Appeals, in countless search and seizure cases, has applied the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Katz</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expectation of privacy rationale, and to accept </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Oliver's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> return to what was thought to have been an abandoned conception of the Fourth Amendment, which predicates application of the Fourth Amendment on property concepts and a literal interpretation of its text, would be contrary to the Court of Appeals post- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Katz</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case law.  Further, the rule that an owner can never have an expectation of privacy in open lands is repugnant to New York's acceptance of the right to be let alone as a fundamental right deserving legal protection. Moreover, the unbridled license given to agents of the State to roam at will without permission on private property in search of incriminating evidence is repugnant to the most basic notions of fairness in New York's criminal law. In addition, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Oliver</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> majority's suggestion that, in deciding whether a landowner's expectation of privacy is legitimate, a court may consider the legality of the very conduct sought to be kept private, would, if allowed, contravene New York's established search and seizure law and offend accepted notions as to the proper limits on governmental authority to intrude upon and control noninjurious activities of its citizens conducted within the private confines of their property.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlawful Search and Seizure - State Constitution - Private Land Posted with &quot;No Trespassing&quot; Signs </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. For the purpose of protection from unreasonable searches and seizures under NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 12, landowners who fence or post &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs on their private property or, by some other means, indicate unmistakably that entry is not permitted, have a reasonable expectation that their privacy rights will be respected and that they will be free from unwanted intrusions. Accordingly, in the prosecution of defendant landowner for illegally growing marihuana, outside the curtilage of his mobile home, in an open field on his property, which was posted with &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs, warrantless entries of defendant's property by a State Police Investigator and a private citizen, acting at the request of the police, were illegal under article I, &sect; 12.  The People do not contend that defendant failed to manifest a subjective expectation of privacy or that the area where the marihuana was allegedly being cultivated was in plain view from a place of public access; therefore, the search warrant obtained on the basis of these illegal entries was a nullity and the seizure of the evidence discovered upon its execution should have been suppressed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlawful Search and Seizure - Administrative Search of Vehicle Dismantling Shop - Validity of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a (5) (a) under State Constitution </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a (5) (a), which authorizes the police to conduct random warrantless searches of vehicle dismantling businesses to determine whether such businesses are trafficking in stolen automobile parts, violates the privacy rights protected by the State Constitution's proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures (NY Const, art I, &sect; 12).  The so-called &quot;administrative search&quot; exception to the Fourth Amendment's probable cause and warrant requirements cannot be invoked where the search is undertaken solely to uncover evidence of criminality and the underlying regulatory scheme is in reality designed simply to give the police an expedient means of enforcing penal sanctions.  Further, section 415-a (5) (a)'s administrative search provisions lack the element of pervasive governmental supervision essential to qualification for the administrative search exception.  Moreover, section 415-a (5) (a) fails to delineate rules to guarantee the certainty and regularity of application necessary to provide a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.  That the statute is supported by a substantial governmental interest, and that warrantless searches are necessary to further the regulatory scheme, do not alone provide sufficient justification for departing from article I, &sect; 12's general prohibition against warrantless, suspicionless searches.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unlawful Search and Seizure - Prerequisites for Valid Administrative Inspection Statute under State Constitution </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. To be consistent with NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 12, statutory provisions for administrative inspections of vehicle dismantling businesses must be part of a comprehensive administrative program that is unrelated to the enforcement of the criminal laws.  Moreover, the inspections must be pursuant to an administrative warrant issued by a neutral Magistrate, although they need not be based on probable cause in the traditional sense, or, alternatively, the law must provide for such certainty and regularity of application as to be a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - State Constitutional Law - Role of State Court Vis-A-Vis United States Supreme Court Precedent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In deciding State constitutional law cases, the decisions made by the Court of Appeals must come down to judgments as to whether a particular protection is adequate or sufficient, even as to whether constitutional protections enjoyed in New York have in fact been diluted by subsequent decisions of a more recent United States Supreme Court.  In that no two cases are identical, it is the nature of the process that in the end a judgment must be made as to the application of existing precedents to new facts.  The Court of Appeals must be faithful to its precedents, but where it concludes that the Supreme Court has changed course and diluted constitutional principles, the Court of Appeals does not act improperly in discharging its responsibility to support the State Constitution when it examines whether it should follow along as a matter of State law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - State Constitutional Law - Propriety of State Court Rejection of United States Supreme Court Precedent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In deciding State constitutional law cases, a State court which rejects United States Supreme Court precedent and opts for greater safeguards as a matter of State law does not unduly denigrate or disdain the Supreme Court, but instead discharges its responsibility both to State law and to Federal law.  It is the right and the responsibility of State courts to interpret their own Constitutions, and where in the State courts' view those provisions afford greater safeguards than the Supreme Court would find, to make plain the State decisional ground so as to avoid unnecessary Supreme Court review.  </SPAN></P>

The association contended that the regulation violated the Establishment Clause, U.S. Const. amend. I. Under the tripartite test for evaluating the constitutionality of governmental actions under the Establishment Clause, the court found that the regulations had a secular purpose to acquire broad community support and then to disseminate accurate information about the AIDS epidemic. The regulations did not have a principal or primary effect that advances or inhibits religion because it advanced rational, legitimate, educational, and secular goals, and did not favor or prefer religious ones. The court found that the challenged composition of advisory councils was not likely to give rise to a perception that the government had favored or preferred religious over nonreligious groups.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant N.Y. State Liquor Authority and plaintiffs, bar and recreation center, filed cross appeals of the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which granted plaintiff licensees' petitions pursuant to N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, bar and recreation center, filed petitions pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 challenging defendant N.Y.

The appellate court granted the petition based on the failure to recuse and remitted for further proceedings without that commissioner. Cross appeals were filed. On appeal, the court found that defendant's application of N.Y. State Liquor Auth. R. 36.1(q) as a no-fault rule was incorrect because it was in direct conflict with the plain language of N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 106(6). The court dismissed the charges that plaintiffs, bar and recreation, had become &quot;focal points&quot; of police attention because there was no evidence plaintiffs were told of the violations. The charge of sale of alcohol to a minor in violation of N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 65(1) against plaintiff bar was remitted to defendant and ordered that the commissioner who was the attorney for the N.Y. State Liquor Authority during the investigation be recused.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Rule 36.1 (q) of the Rules of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) (9 NYCRR 53.1 [q]), which provides for the revocation, cancellation or suspension of a license when &quot;any noise, disturbance, misconduct, disorder, act or activity occurs in the licensed premises, or in the area in front of or adjacent to the licensed premises, or in any parking lot provided by the licensee for use by licensee's patrons, which ... results in the licensed premises becoming a focal point for police attention&quot;, is invalid as applied to petitioner licensees to require no demonstration of a licensee's awareness of the alleged disorderly conduct in order to sustain a charge of a violation of rule 36.1 (q).  The rule as applied conflicts with the plain language of the legislation that is the basis for the agency's rule (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &sect; 106 [6]) which requires the licensee's awareness of the disorderly conduct. Whatever power the SLA may have to delineate &quot;for cause&quot; grounds for revocation not specified in the statute, that general authority cannot override the specific legislative mandate of an awareness element in section 106 governing disorderly conduct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intoxicating Liquors - Licenses - Recusal of Commissioner - Prior Employment as Counsel to State Liquor Authority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A Commissioner of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) who was SLA Counsel when certain charges against petitioner licensee were filed and heard before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), should have recused herself from the final agency determinations concerning those charges, notwithstanding that she did not actively participate in the hearing before the ALJ and had no actual knowledge of the facts of the case.  The Commissioner's role as petitioner's &quot;prosecutor&quot; in this case was inherently incompatible with her subsequent participation as its Judge.  Moreover, fundamental fairness requires at least that one who participates in a case on behalf of any party, whether actively or merely formally by being on the pleadings or briefs, take no part in the decision of that case by any tribunal on which that person may thereafter sit.  </SPAN></P>

In license revocation and nonrenewal proceedings in which the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) sustained charges that petitioner licensee had violated rule 36.1 (q) of the Rules of the State Liquor Authority (9 NYCRR 53.1 [q]) concerning disorderly conduct on licensed premises, the ALJ's added remark that petitioner obviously was aware of what was going on, after the ALJ had erroneously concluded that rule 36.1 (q) was &quot;no fault&quot; in nature and sustained the charges on that basis, cannot eradicate the error of law that infected his findings.  In light of his ruling that strict liability was the governing legal standard, it is moreover impossible to determine what degree of &quot;awareness&quot; he had in mind by the later statement.  Thus, the ALJ's findings on the charge that petitioner violated rule 36.1 (q), which were dispositive of the license revocation and nonrenewal proceedings against petitioner, must be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner religious camp sought an exemption under N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 420-a(1)(a). Respondent assessor determined that certain housing units and 10 acres of land were taxable because they were not used exclusively for religious purposes, and the trial court agreed. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) reversed, declaring camp's property wholly exempt. Assessor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that uncontradicted record evidence demonstrated that the housing units were occupied exclusively by staff, teachers, Rabbis, and families, members of which were either students at the camp or parents of students too young to attend without parental supervision. The court held that if the camp was unable to provide residential housing accommodations to its faculty, staff, students and their families, its primary purposes of providing rigorous religious and educational instruction would be seriously undermined. Thus, these housing facilities were necessary and reasonably incidental to the primary purpose of the facility, notwithstanding the existence of limited housing facilities nearby. The use of the caretaker's residence was clearly incidental to the maintenance of the facility, so that residence was also tax exempt. The court distinguished cases in which caretakers were not full-time employees of the exempt organization. Finally, the 10-acre wooded parcel of land used for recreational purposes by the students was incidental to the primary religious purpose of the entire 31-acre parcel, and was entitled to exemption as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the appellate division, awarding costs to the camp.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Exemptions - Real Property Used Exclusively for Religious Purposes - Residential Housing Accommodations - Recreational Use </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test of entitlement to tax exemption under RPTL 420-a (1) (a), which provides that real property owned by a corporation or association organized or conducted exclusively for religious purposes, if used exclusively for such purposes, shall be exempt from taxation, is whether the particular use is reasonably incidental to the primary or major purpose of the facility. Accordingly, petitioner, a not-for-profit religious corporation whose primary purpose is the teaching of the principles and doctrines of the Jewish faith, is entitled to a tax exemption under section 420-a (1) (a) for those portions of a 31-acre parcel at which it conducts religious educational programs that contain housing facilities occupied exclusively by staff, teachers, Rabbis, students and their families.  If petitioner was unable to provide residential housing accommodations to such individuals, its primary purposes of providing rigorous religious and educational instruction at the yeshivah would be seriously undermined; thus, these housing facilities are &quot;necessary and reasonably incidental&quot; to the primary purpose of the facility, notwithstanding the existence of limited housing facilities nearby. Further, the trailer occupied by the caretaker whose full-time job is to maintain the premises during the summer months and to keep the property secure during the remaining months of the year is also tax exempt, since the use of the residence is clearly incidental to the maintenance of the facility which serves the religious purposes for which petitioner was organized.  In addition, a 10-acre wooded portion of the land used for recreational purposes by the students is incidental to the primary religious purpose of the entire 31-acre parcel and, therefore, entitled to exemption as well.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In early 1986, the personnel director promulgated a personnel policy and procedure bulletin requiring candidates for appointment or promotion to disclose and pay debts owed petitioner city.

The board determined the unilateral imposition of the bulletin constituted an improper public employer practice, directed the city to cease and desist from enforcing such requirements, and directed all parties to negotiate in good faith concerning the disclosure and repayment of debts owed. The personnel director then filed an art. 78 petition. The supreme court annulled the board's decision, and the board sought review. On review, the appellate division affirmed. Consequently, the board again appealed, arguing the city's policy involved mandatorily bargainable terms and conditions of employment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A dispute as to whether a particular matter falls within the terms and conditions of employment and is thus a mandatory subject of negotiation under the New York City Collective Bargaining Law (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 12-301 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">),</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must be resolved in the first instance by the labor relations agency with jurisdiction over the employees involved, not by the New York City Personnel Director.  The regulatory scheme of the Collective Bargaining Law envisions that in the first instance the threshold issue whether a particular subject matter is bargainable should be decided by the Board of Collective Bargaining of the City of New York, the impartial body with expertise in the area, rather than by the public employer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - New York City Personnel Policy Requiring Disclosure and Payment of Debts Owed City - Validity of Determination That Policy Not Managerial Prerogative of Setting Employment Qualifications </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A determination of the Board of Collective Bargaining of the City of New York that the City, in unilaterally instituting a personnel policy which required as a condition of appointment or promotion that candidates disclose and pay debts owed the City, was not in fact exercising in good faith the managerial prerogative of setting employment qualifications so as to be excluded from the scope of collective bargaining, but was in reality engaged in revenue-raising, was not arbitrary, capricious or legally impermissible. The reasons explicating and supporting the Board's conclusion were drawn from record evidence of the operation of this particular policy, considered in combination with its origins, including the City's acknowledged economic purpose in taking this action.  Although the Board recognized that character and reputation could be an appropriate qualification for employment or promotion, it concluded from the combined substance and history of this policy that it was neither intended nor used as such by the City but was purely an economic measure.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Collective Bargaining - Matters Subject to Negotiation - Disclosure and Payment of Public Debt by Public Employees </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There is no basis in the law for now holding that, in the context of public sector labor relations, a policy mandating the disclosure and repayment of public debt must in every instance be considered a matter of employee integrity so as to foreclose negotiation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - New York City Personnel Policy Requiring Disclosure and Payment of Public Debt as Affecting Terms and Conditions of Employment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The conclusion of the Board of Collective Bargaining of the City of New York that a personnel policy unilaterally instituted by the City, which required as a condition of appointment or promotion that candidates disclose and pay debts owed the City, affected terms and conditions of employment, is entitled to deference by the courts.  So long as the Board's interpretation is legally permissible and so long as there is no breach of constitutional rights and protections, the courts have no power to substitute another interpretation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - New York City Personnel Policy Requiring Disclosure and Payment of Public Debt - Payroll Deduction Subject to Collective Bargaining as Affecting Wages </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In deciding a challenge to a New York City personnel policy unilaterally ordering that, as a condition to appointment or promotion, candidates disclose and pay debts owed the City, the conclusion of the Board of Collective Bargaining of the City of New York that the payroll deduction term of the policy's repayment agreement, which provided that if an employee demonstrates hardship, payroll deductions may be made, up to 10% of net pay, affected wages and was therefore a matter within the scope of collective bargaining, has a rational basis and should be upheld.  That &quot;payroll deductions&quot; is not expressly listed in the Collective Bargaining Law (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 12-301 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a subject within the scope of bargaining is irrelevant; the statutory delineation of the topics of bargaining is intentionally broad, to be explicated by the Board on a case-by-case basis, because it is impossible to provide in a statute a detailed listing of all the issues which are negotiable.  Moreover, that the City purportedly could have insisted on lump-sum payment does not transform this bargainable term and condition of employment into one that is not.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil Service - Appointment and Promotion - New York City Personnel Policy Requiring Disclosure and Payment of Public Debt - Questionnaire Not Intrusive of Promotion Candidates' Personal Privacy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. On a challenge to a New York City personnel policy unilaterally ordering that, as a condition to appointment or promotion, candidates disclose and pay debts owed the City, the conclusion of the Board of Collective Bargaining of the City of New York that a certain questionnaire required to be completed by all such candidates so intruded on the personal privacy of promotion candidates that it constituted a unilateral change in the terms and conditions of their employment, is impermissible and must be rejected. Virtually all of the information sought in the questionnaire--10 years of home addresses as well as information regarding motor vehicle registrations; unpaid parking violations or other fines, penalties or judgments in favor of the City; public assistance overpayments; and whether State and City income tax returns had been filed for the previous five years--if not already in the City's possession, is a matter of public record.  The Board itself characterized the expectation of privacy in such information as &quot;minimal,&quot; and concluded that such questions were permissible of new hires.  No rational balancing of the competing interests--the City's substantial interest in collecting outstanding debt against an employee's right to privacy--could result in a conclusion that this questionnaire alters a term or condition of employment. </SPAN></P>

The aliens brought an action seeking a declaration that the deeming provision was unconstitutional.

The court disagreed holding that even though striking down the state deeming policy of N.Y. Soc. Serv.

The State Commissioner of Social Services has failed to show that by enacting the Federal deeming policy concerning aliens' eligibility for AFDC, Congress intended to preempt State assistance for aliens as a matter of immigration policy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a trial court's order that denied the state's motion to dismiss plaintiff employees' wage withholding complaint, granted the employees' motions for summary judgment, declared N.Y. State Fin. Law &sect; 200(2-b)&nbsp;unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined the state from enforcing &sect; 200(2-b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state contended that it could postpone the employees' pay because the contracts with the employees' unions expired before &sect; 200(2-b) was enacted. The court held that although the stated term of the contracts had been completed, the contracts remained in effect between the parties under the continuing benefits provision of N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 209-a(1)(e). Therefore, the court held that the employees were protected under the Contracts Clause. The court also held that &sect; 200(2-b) did not repeal &sect; 209-a. Furthermore, the court held that &sect; 200(2-b) violated the federal Constitution because it substantially impaired the obligation of contracts. The court held that the substantial impairment was not reasonable and necessary to accomplish a legitimate public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Nonjudicial Personnel - Statutory Continuation of Terms of Expired Collective Bargaining Agreements </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Collective bargaining agreements between plaintiff public employee unions and defendant State that expired on March 31, 1991, were extended in the absence of newly negotiated agreements pursuant to Civil Service Law &sect; 209-a (1) (e), which provides that the terms of an &quot;expired agreement&quot; shall continue until a new agreement is negotiated and, therefore, plaintiffs are afforded protection under the Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, cl [1]) with respect to the agreements that expired on March 31, 1991.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Nonjudicial Personnel - Statutory Continuation of Expired Collective Bargaining Agreements - No Repeal by Lag Payroll Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature did not repeal Civil Service Law &sect; 209-a (1) (e), which provides that the terms of an expired collective bargaining agreement shall continue until a new agreement is negotiated, by enacting the deferred payroll statute that effected a five-day lag payroll upon nonjudicial employees of the Unified Court System (State Finance Law &sect; 200 [2- b]).  Section 200 (2-b) contains no express repeal, its terms do not conflict with those of section 209-a (1) (e) and it contains no other language from which an intent to repeal may be inferred.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Impairment of Contract - Lag Payroll Statute for Nonjudicial Personnel of Unified Court System </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. State Finance Law &sect; 200 (2-b), which effected a five-day lag payroll upon both represented and unrepresented nonjudicial employees of the Unified Court System for the fiscal year 1991-1992, unconstitutionally impairs the employment contracts of the represented employees, which were extended upon their expiration on March 31, 1991 by virtue of Civil Service Law &sect; 209-a (1) (e), in violation of US Constitution, article I, &sect; 10, clause (1). The impairment of contract created by the lag payroll is substantial.  It results in withholding 10% of an employee's expected wages each week over a period of 10 weeks; salary that will not be repaid until the employee leaves State service, which may be years in the future.  Moreover, the impairment is not sustainable as reasonable and necessary to achieve the State's purposes of offsetting anticipated State budget shortfalls for the fiscal year 1991-1992.  The menu of revenue-raising or revenue-saving alternatives does not include impairing contract rights to obtain forced loans to the State from its employees.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Lag Payroll Statute for Nonjudicial Personnel of Unified Court System - Severability of Statute Insofar as Applicable to Unrepresented Employees </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. State Finance Law &sect; 200 (2-b), which imposed a lag payroll on both represented and unrepresented nonjudicial employees of the Unified Court System for the fiscal year 1991-1992, and thereby unconstitutionally impaired the contracts of the represented nonjudicial employees, should not be applied to lag the pay of the unrepresented employees under the principal of severability. In a general way, severance could preserve the purpose of the payroll lag statute because at least some savings might be realized by continuing the lag against unrepresented employees.  However, only 10% of the employees intended to be affected by the statute would remain subject to the lag. There is little reason to believe the Legislature would conclude that this burden should be imposed on only a small segment of the employees of the Unified Court System where the intended effect of the statute has been so severely undercut.  Significantly, section 200 (2-b) contains no severability clause and it does not differentiate between represented and unrepresented employees.  Moreover, neither of two previously enacted lag payrolls applied to only a limited segment of the employee pool or provided for severability if the statute was invalid as to some of those affected.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the granting of a motion by petitioners for an order directing respondents to turn over to petitioners personal property held by respondent property clerk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners requested return of property owned by them and held by respondent property clerk, pursuant to the expedited procedure set forth in the McClendon order. On appeal, the court found that although petitioners did not comply with all procedural steps that a strict reading of the McClendon order required, petitioners' demand should have been honored. The court held respondent property clerk should have honored the demand made without a District Attorney's release and more than seven months after 90-day period expired because once criminal proceedings terminated, due process required the property be returned upon demand unless the government could establish a new basis for detention. Petitioners' failure to produce the release could not stand as a bar to a claim where the District Attorney refused to issue a release and failed to either initiate a timely forfeiture proceeding or to offer a valid reason for continued retention of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order as the McClendon order was not binding on the court and due process required property be returned upon demand once criminal proceedings terminated unless a new basis for detention could be established.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Demand for Return of Property - What Constitutes &quot;Termination of Criminal Proceedings&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Demands by one petitioner for the return of property owned by him and held by respondent Property Clerk of the City of New York, which were made after petitioner's guilty plea to the charges that gave rise to the property's seizure but before petitioner's sentencing, are premature under that portion of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McClendon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> procedure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(McClendon v Rosetti,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Dist Ct, SD NY, July 15, 1974, Lasker, J., 70 Civ 3851) which provides for a demand by a claimant for the return of his property within 90 days after the termination of criminal proceedings.  CPL 1.20 (18) provides that a criminal proceeding &quot;means any proceeding which ... constitutes a part of a criminal action&quot;, and CPL 1.20 (16) provides that a criminal action &quot;terminates with the imposition of sentence or some other final disposition in a criminal court of the last accusatory instrument filed in the case&quot;.  In addition, especially if the seized property is related to the criminal proceedings, there may be valid reasons not to release the property until after sentencing--it may form the basis for a restitutionary component of a sentence, for example.  Furthermore, inasmuch as a successful appeal might require use of the seized property as evidence in a trial or retrial, as the case may be, the property clerk should not be required to release property--where the predicate for release is termination of the criminal proceedings--until direct appeals have been exhausted or the time to take a direct appeal has expired, 30 days after sentencing (CPL 460.10 [1] [a]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Timeliness of Demand for Return of Property </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondents' refusal to honor petitioners' demand for the return of property owned by them and held by the Property Clerk of the City of New York, on the ground that the demand was untimely having been made more than seven months after expiration of the 90-day period for claims for return of such property under the expedited procedure set forth in the unpublished order in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McClendon v Rosetti</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (US Dist Ct, SD NY, July 15, 1974, Lasker, J., 70 Civ 3851), is without basis.  The purpose of limiting the period for making a demand to 90 days, after which the property clerk can transfer the property or its proceeds to the Police Pension Fund, is to free the property clerk from the burden of maintaining custody of the property indefinitely.  That interest was not compromised here.  The property clerk was on notice that petitioners were interested in recovering the property in his custody as soon as possible, by virtue of initial demands for return of the property which were denied on the ground that the property could not be released until a tax levy was satisfied.  Although petitioners immediately renewed their demand upon satisfaction of the levy approximately 11 months later, respondents contend that this was too late and that the demand should have been made 8 to 10 months earlier at a time when they knew and had informed petitioners that it could not be honored because of the pending tax levy. Respondents do not explain what purpose would have been served by such a futile demand, nor do they contend that they had already disposed of the property.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Demand for Return of Property - Necessity of District Attorney's Release </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A claimant's failure to produce a District Attorney's release, as provided by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McClendon</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> procedure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(McClendon v Rosetti,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US Dist Ct, SD NY, July 15, 1974, Lasker, J., 70 Civ 3851), cannot stand as a bar to his claim for return of property owned by him and held by the Property Clerk of the City of New York after its seizure by the police in connection with a criminal proceeding where, as in this case, the District Attorney refuses to issue a release sought by the claimant and fails either to initiate a timely forfeiture proceeding or to offer a valid reason for continued retention of the property, such as the pendency of further relevant criminal proceedings. Where the District Attorney takes neither step, proof that a demand for a release was made on the District Attorney is sufficient to satisfy the claimant's burden.  The pendency of a criminal proceeding is prima facie justification for detention by the government of property related to that proceeding, and it is reasonable to require the claimant to establish the contrary by obtaining a release from the District Attorney.  Once all criminal proceedings related to the property have terminated, however, as was the case here, the government's presumptive right to detain the property no longer exists.  In such cases, any further detention must be justified by a new predicate, such as a forfeiture proceeding or perhaps the initiation of further criminal proceedings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forfeitures and Penalties - Forfeiture of Proceeds or Instrumentality of Crime - Demand for Return of Property - Proof of Ownership </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A demand by petitioners for the return of property owned by them and held by respondent Property Clerk of the City of New York in connection with certain criminal charges, was incorrectly denied on the ground that petitioners failed to provide proof of ownership as agreed to as part of their plea agreements.  A statement by one petitioner's attorney following entry of that petitioner's plea to the effect that the Assistant District Attorney (ADA) had agreed to return the property upon proof of ownership satisfactory to her is too ambiguous to establish a waiver of petitioners' rights under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McClendon v Rosetti</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (US Dist Ct, SD NY, July 15, 1974, Lasker, J., 70 Civ 3851), which resulted in an unpublished order prescribing an expedited procedure for the return of such property.  At most, the statement is evidence that the ADA and one petitioner's attorney in the criminal proceeding erroneously believed that the District Attorney had control over whether the property would be returned, which does not bind that petitioner in this proceeding.  In any event, the statement by that petitioner's attorney would not bind the other petitioner, who has an independent right to the return of the property.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant buyers appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of the trial court granting plaintiff sellers' motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint and denying the buyers' cross motion to dismiss the action for legal insufficiency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sellers contracted to sell a parcel of land to a predecessor in interest of the buyers. Under the contract, the purchase price was to be determined by the number of square feet approved by local authorities for use as retail sales space. The buyer later failed to make the required payments, and the seller obtained two judgments against the buyer in Pennsylvania. Frustrated in their enforcement efforts in Pennsylvania, the sellers commenced an action in New York by summons and notice of motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint. The appellate court held that the Pennsylvania cognovit judgment on the bond and warrant should have been accorded full faith and credit. On appeal, the buyers contended that cognovit judgments as a matter of law were not entitled to full faith and credit in New York. The court held that the Pennsylvania cognovit judgment was to be given full faith and credit in New York under 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Full Faith and Credit -- Pennsylvania Cognovit Judgment -- Waiver of Debtor's Right to Notice and Opportunity to be Heard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A Pennsylvania cognovit judgment, obtained under that State's laws, is entitled to full faith and credit in New York where defendants voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived their due process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard.  Defendants were sophisticated parties involved in an arm's length commercial transaction, and the parties were represented by counsel in negotiating the terms of the agreement.  Defendants received consideration for executing the bond and warrant, which contained the cognovit provision, in the form of a modification of the agreement's payment terms.  Further, the facts belie defendants' assertion that they were unaware of the cognovit provision; in any event, the bald assertion that these sophisticated defendants, entering upon a significant transaction, did not read the document cannot excuse their legal obligation or overcome the substantial evidence of waiver.  Thus, defendants waived their due process rights, as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Full Faith and Credit -- Scope of Judicial Review in Action to Enforce Sister-State Cognovit Judgment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a New York action to enforce a Pennsylvania cognovit judgment, defendants may not argue the merits of the Pennsylvania judgment on an appeal to the Court of Appeals from an Appellate Division order which affirmed an order of the Supreme Court granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment based upon its holding that the judgment was entitled to full faith and credit.  As a matter of full faith and credit, review by New York courts is limited to determining whether the rendering court had jurisdiction, an inquiry which includes due process considerations.  Thus, inquiry into the merits of the underlying dispute is foreclosed.  Moreover, although this is a confessed judgment, defendants have been offered, and have availed themselves of, a full and fair opportunity to argue the merits in the Pennsylvania courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Per Se Unconstitutionality of Pennsylvania Cognovit Judgment Scheme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Atlas Credit Corp. v Ezrine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (25 NY2d 219) concerning the per se unconstitutionality of the Pennsylvania cognovit scheme is no longer valid in light of subsequent United States Supreme Court decisions </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Overmyer Co. v Frick Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 405 U.S. 174; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Swarb v Lennox</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 405 U.S. 191). Cognovit judgments entered in other jurisdictions cannot automatically be denied full faith and credit; rather, enforceability must depend on the facts of each case.  More particularly, it must be determined that the judgment debtor made a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Full Faith and Credit -- Pennsylvania Cognovit Judgments as &quot;Judgments&quot; for Full Faith</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> and Credit Purposes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Judgments entered pursuant to the amended Pennsylvania cognovit procedure, which has reduced the burden on the petitioning judgment debtor for opening the cognovit judgment -- thereby facilitating access to a judicial determination of the merits of the underlying claim -- and now provides that notice of entry be mailed by the court clerk rather than the plaintiff's attorney, are &quot;judgments&quot; for full faith and credit purposes in New York State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Full Faith and Credit -- Validity of Pennsylvania Cognovit Judgment -- Necessity of Prejudgment Waiver Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. For the purpose of determining whether a Pennsylvania cognovit judgment, obtained under that State's laws, should be given full faith and credit in New York, the failure to conduct a hearing to determine the effectiveness of the waiver of due process rights prior to the entry of judgment in the forum State does not render the Pennsylvania judgment invalid.  There need not, as a matter of law, be a prejudgment hearing in every instance to determine whether the debtor waived its right to notice and a prejudgment hearing.  The need for a hearing should be determined on a case-by-case basis.  A hearing at some stage would clearly be warranted where the record is insufficient to support a waiver determination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was employed at a high school which was operated by a religious organization. When the teacher's employment was terminated before the end of the school year, she applied for unemployment insurance benefits and was denied.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unemployment Insurance -- Benefits -- Constitutionality of Statutory Exclusion from Unemployment Insurance Coverage of Persons Engaged in Religious Employment -- Establishment Clause of United States Constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Labor Law &sect; 563, which excludes from unemployment insurance coverage, among others, persons performing duties of a religious nature at a place of worship (&sect; 563 [2] [c]), does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The statute has a clear secular legislative purpose -- to extend unemployment insurance coverage to previously exempt employees of nonprofit organizations, while retaining the exemption for the benefit of a range of nonprofit organizations, including religious organizations, whose employees were not active members of the work force in the true sense and whose employment was stable.  Thus, religious organizations did not receive the exclusive benefit of the exemption, but only received an incidental benefit accorded to a range of other organizations.  Additionally, section 563 (2) (c) minimizes governmental intrusion into religious affairs by avoiding the necessity of scrutinizing a religious group's tenets each time an employee is discharged for reasons related to the group's religious mission.  Further, the statute is not aimed exclusively or specifically at religious groups or organizations, and it does not impermissibly benefit religious organizations more than nonreligious organizations.  Nor does section 563 (2) (c) require unconstitutional entanglement by the State in religious matters; rather, any entanglement between church and State is minimized by the exemption found in section 563 (2) (c), thereby effectuating a more complete separation between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unemployment Insurance -- Benefits -- Constitutionality of Statutory Exclusion from Unemployment Insurance Coverage of Persons Engaged in Religious Employment -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Labor Law &sect; 563, which excludes from unemployment insurance coverage, among others, persons performing duties of a religious nature at a place of worship (&sect; 563 [2] [c]), does not establish an impermissible classification in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, since it is reasonably related to legitimate State interests.  There is no fundamental right to unemployment insurance benefits and the statute does not involve a suspect classification; therefore, to withstand an equal protection challenge the exclusion need only bear a rational relation to a legitimate government interest.  The statutory classification involved here is based upon the religious nature of appellant's employment.  The original purpose of the exclusions of Labor Law &sect; 563 (2) was to extend unemployment insurance coverage to employees of certain nonprofit organizations while retaining the exemption for some organizations, including religious organizations, in accordance with the &quot;time-honored&quot; tradition of sparing certain tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations from the burden of general taxation.  In addition, the exemption promotes the efficient administration of the unemployment insurance program by avoiding undue government involvement in problems peculiar to religious employment.  Section 563 (2) (c) is rationally related to these legitimate purposes and, therefore, does not offend the Equal Protection Clause.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporate shareholder sought review of a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) which denied appellant's petition to annul the determination of respondent finance department that appellant owed city taxes based on dividends and capital gains appellant realized from its investment in another corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporate shareholder was a Delaware manufacturing company that was headquartered in Michigan. Appellant owned shares of a New Jersey (NJ) corporation that was domiciled in New York City (NYC). This investment was managed exclusively from appellant's Michigan offices. Appellant's only connection with NYC was that its overseas business development office was there. Respondent finance department determined that under N.Y. City Admin. Code &sect; 11-604 appellant owed city taxes based on dividends and capital gains it realized from its shares in the NJ corporation. The trial court denied appellant's petition to have this determination annulled and this decision was affirmed by an appellate court. This court also affirmed the trial court's decision. First, despite the lack of a unitary business relationship between appellant and the company in which its held shares, there was a sufficient enough nexus between appellant and the city to support the tax. Second, the imposition of the tax was in accordance with U.S. Const. amend. XIV and art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because it fairly reflected appellant's own presence and activities in the city.</SPAN></P>

A unitary business relationship is not the exclusive means for satisfying the requirement of the Due Process and Commerce Clauses that there be some minimal connection or nexus between the income that a nondomiciliary corporation earns and the taxing jurisdiction in order for a State or municipality to tax that income. In determining whether a sufficient nexus exists, the inquiry should focus on whether the taxing power exerted bears fiscal relation to the protection, opportunities and benefits given by the taxing jurisdiction. Here, the City has afforded privileges and opportunities to the corporation conducting business within New York which have contributed to that corporation's capital appreciation and, thus, inured to the benefit of all its shareholders, including the nondomiciliary corporation.  Accordingly, the City has given the nondomiciliary corporation something &quot;for which it can ask return&quot; and, therefore, a sufficient nexus existed to support the City's tax.  </SPAN></P>

Since it has not been demonstrated that the City's tax on the dividend and capital gain income that the nondomiciliary corporation derived from its investment in the corporation conducting business within New York bore anything but an inherently rational relationship to the manner in which that income was generated, the tax is not unconstitutional on that basis.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner recipient challenged a determination by the respondent Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services pursuant to which her family's Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) grant was reduced by 10 percent in order to recoup an overpayment previously made. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) confirmed the Commissioner's determination. The recipient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient contended that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a)(22) and 45 C.F.R. &sect; 233.20 (a)(13), as well as N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 106-b and N.Y. Const. art. XVII &sect; 1 permitted the Commissioner to recoup overpayment only from her pro rata share of the AFDC grant and prohibited recoupment of the overpayment from the entire assistance unit which included her minor children, unless there had been a prior demonstration that the needs of the children had also diminished. She also claimed entitlement to attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 because the reduction in the family's AFDC benefits constituted a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a)(22), cognizable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court found nothing in the laws or constitution that required recoupment of an AFDC overpayment to have been made from the proportionate share of the individual recipient, rather than from the family unit. Nor was there any requirement that there must have been a prior determination that the needs of the children had diminished before such recoupment could have been made from the grant to that family unit. Thus, the court rejected the recipient's challenges and affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Neither 42 USC &sect; 602 (a) (22) nor 45 CFR 233.20 (a) (13) requires that recoupment of an overpayment of Aid to Families with Dependent Children only be made from the proportionate share of the individual recipient, rather than from the grant to the family unit. Although a State is given the option to obtain the entire sum from the individual receiving the overpayment or to reduce the amount of aid payable to the family or &quot;assistance unit&quot; at a rate of recovery not exceeding 10% of the monthly grant, nothing in the language of the statute requires a State to recoup the overpayment from the pro rata share of the overpaid individual in the first instance. Moreover, a State is not required to demonstrate, before recouping the overpayment from the family unit, that the needs of the child or children have diminished.</SPAN></P>

Social Services Law &sect; 106-b, which mandates that social services officials &quot;take all necessary steps to correct any overpayment or underpayment to a public assistance recipient&quot;, does not require that recoupment of an overpayment of Aid to Families with Dependent Children only be made from the proportionate share of the individual recipient of the overpayment, rather than from the grant to the family unit, or that there must be a prior determination that the needs of the children of a family unit have diminished before such recoupment can be made from the grant to that family unit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Social Services Law &sect; 106-b, which provides that the Commissioner of Social Services must establish procedures for correcting overpayments of public assistance that are designed to minimize adverse impact on the recipient, and to the extent possible avoid &quot;undue hardship&quot;, and its implementing regulation which permits a recoupment rate of only 5% in cases where it is established that a 10% rate would produce undue hardship (18 NYCRR 352.31 [d] [2]), were not violated by respondent State Commissioner of Social Services imposing a recoupment rate of 10% against petitioner's family unit to recover an overpayment of Aid to Families with Dependent Children on behalf of petitioner without having first determined that the needs of the children in the family unit have diminished. Social Services Law &sect; 106-b does not require respondent to guarantee that there will be no undue hardship in all cases; rather, it requires that the procedures be designed to minimize adverse impact and to the extent possible avoid undue hardship. 18 NYCRR 352.31 (d) (2) is consistent with and appropriately effectuates the statutory requirement to minimize the adverse impact of such recoupment. Moreover, petitioner was provided an opportunity to establish her undue hardship claim at a fair hearing as provided by the regulation, and respondent's determination that she failed to meet her burden so as to be entitled to an application of the lower recoupment rate is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Inasmuch as respondent State Commissioner of Social Services' recoupment of an overpayment of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) by a temporary 10% reduction of the AFDC grant to the family unit, rather than from the proportionate share of the individual recipient, and without a prior determination that the needs of the children of the family unit have diminished, does not violate 42 USC &sect; 602 (a) (22), petitioner is not entitled to an award of attorney's fees pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1988. </SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed on the basis of decisional caselaw, which required that discharged civil servants be afforded a pretermination hearing.

Petitioner's discharge implicated contested questions regarding his physical condition and whether his ability to perform the desk job he had filled for the preceding 10 years constituted an ability &quot;to perform the duties of his position&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 73.

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), issued judgments for the governor and others.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The settlement agreement at issue was entered into so that the power authority could acquire a nuclear power plant and close it. The nuclear power plant was plagued with a number of problems and it was hoped that the closure of the plant would result in lower electricity rates for customers. The Long Island Power Authority Act (Act), created the power authority to achieve the desired results of the plant's closure and lower electricity rates. The governor signed a settlement agreement that provided the power plant would be sold to the power authority. The individuals, business groups, and interest groups argued that the settlement agreement contravened the Act and that the governor, power authority, and others exceeded their statutory authority. The court found that the governor, power authority and others acted within the purpose articulated and intended by the Act, the closure and decommissioning of the power plant. The legislature wanted the power plant closed and decommissioned, and it expressly declared its legislative policy that the power authority's acquisition, closure and decommissioning of the plant would accomplish an objective of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

The language of the LIPA Act and its legislative history cogently portray the Act's objectives: LIPA's acquisition and closure of Shoreham, or LIPA's takeover and replacement of LILCO as a utility provider, or both, dependent only on control of rates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Public Authorities Law &sect;&sect; 1020-a, 1020-h).  The only condition attached to LIPA's decision to acquire any or all of the assets or stock of LILCO is LIPA's determination that such acquisition would result in rates to LILCO's customers not higher than LILCO would have charged had there been no such acquisition (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-h [2], [4], [10]).  Once that threshold is satisfied, LIPA is empowered -- but not required -- to make any such acquisition. No provision can be found anywhere in the LIPA Act which expressly or by reasonable implication requires that LIPA must exert its full acquisition authority contemporaneously with the acquisition and decommissioning of Shoreham itself.  Thus, in making the Settlement Agreement, the respondents acted within their respective constitutional and statutory authority and effected a properly delegated discretionary policy and purpose articulated and intended by the LIPA Act.</SPAN></P>

A &quot;Settlement Agreement&quot; (the Agreement) made by respondent Governor and various executive agencies, providing essentially for the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) to acquire the Long Island Lighting Company's (LILCO) Shoreham Nuclear Plant and to close and decommission that plant, did not violate the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8 [SEQRA]) on the ground that respondents failed to produce Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) before making or approving the Agreement, since the decommissioning of Shoreham was a &quot;ministerial act&quot; expressly exempt from SEQRA </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL 8-0105 [5] [ii]; 6 NYCRR 617.2 [x]).  The LIPA Act declares that LIPA's acquisition of LILCO's assets or stock is not State &quot;action&quot; subject to SEQRA, and that SEQRA &quot;shall not be applicable in any respect to such acquisition or any action of [LIPA] to effect such acquisition.&quot; (Public Authorities Law &sect; 1020-s [2].) When it passed the LIPA Act, the Legislature -- inescapably aware of the inherent environmental consequences of Shoreham's shutdown -- necessarily judged for itself the propriety of closure and decommissioning and mandated such action (Public Authorities Law &sect;&sect; 1020-a, 1020-h [9]).  LIPA's nondiscretionary action in complying with the Legislature's mandate that Shoreham be decommissioned was a ministerial act.  It was not up to LIPA to produce an EIS to evaluate the propriety of the legislative policy choice of decommissioning because, in this case, mandating SEQRA review would have the effect of overriding the Legislature's express exemption (6 NYCRR 617.2 [q] [5]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A &quot;Settlement Agreement&quot; made by respondent Governor and various executive agencies, providing essentially for the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) to acquire the Long Island Lighting Company's (LILCO) Shoreham Nuclear Plant and to close and decommission that plant, did not violate the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8 [SEQRA]) on the ground that respondent Power Authority of the State of New York (PASNY) failed to do a SEQRA review before it agreed to aid LIPA in decommissioning Shoreham and constructing alternative generating facilities for LILCO, if requested.  PASNY's agreement to aid LIPA concerns proposed actions which had not reached the point at which SEQRA review is required at the time the Settlement Agreement was made.  No decommissioning plan had been proposed or selected; no plans to build generating plants to replace Shoreham had been proposed or formulated; and no decision even to build such plants had been made.  The subsequent selection of a specific decommissioning method has already received full environmental review, culminating in a Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement.  PASNY's construction of facilities -- if ever undertaken -- will be subject to independent SEQRA review when a specific project plan is actually formulated and proposed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent employee was charged with misconduct by appellant city environmental department and subsequently was dismissed from his employment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Civil Service Law &sect; 76, which provides that the Civil Service Commission's decision on an appeal to it by an aggrieved employee from a determination in a disciplinary proceeding &quot;shall be final and conclusive, and not subject to review in any court&quot; (&sect; 76 [3]), precludes judicial review of the merits of a determination of respondent New York City Civil Service Commission reversing the determination of petitioner New York City Department of Environmental Protection rendered in an employee disciplinary proceeding. The Legislature is permitted to restrict the availability of judicial review of administrative determinations, and the language in section 76 is clear and unambiguous in its intent to preclude judicial review of Commission decisions.  Further, despite the fact that the Commission disregarded the credibility determinations of the Administrative Law Judge, there is no showing that this was unconstitutional, illegal, or outside the Commission's jurisdiction.  The Commission's determination should be treated, therefore, in all respects as final and conclusive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that modified a judgment convicting defendant of two counts of first-degree robbery and sentencing him as a second violent felony offender under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed an order that modified a judgment convicting defendant of two counts of first-degree robbery and sentencing him as a second violent felony offender under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.04. The modification consisted of vacating the finding that defendant was a second violent felony offender and remanding the matter for resentencing. The appellate court held that defendant's most recent prior conviction, which was vacated and the indictment dismissed, could not toll the 10-year limitation period of section 70.04. Therefore, because the sentence on defendant's other prior conviction was imposed more than 10 years before the current felony was committed he could not be sentenced as a second violent felony offender. According to the court, when a repeat felony offender statute provided that incarceration &quot;for any reason&quot; extended the limitations period, it contemplated at least that defendant had not been imprisoned without reason or unconstitutionally. Defendant's prior conviction, for rape, was vacated after new evidence revealed that the complainant had psychiatric problems. According to the appellate court, defendant was imprisoned without reason.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For purposes of enhanced sentencing of second violent felony offenders, the 10-year limitation on the time between imposition of sentence on the prior felony and the commission of the felony on which defendant currently is being sentenced (Penal Law &sect; 70.04 [1] [b] [iv]) is not tolled pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.04 (1) (b) (v) during a period of incarceration when the conviction on which the incarceration was based was vacated for newly discovered evidence under CPL 440.10 (1) (g) and the indictment subsequently dismissed on the District Attorney's affirmation that the People would not be able to establish defendant's guilt on a new trial. Section 70.04 (1) (b) (v), which excludes from the 10-year limitation period any period of time that the defendant was incarcerated &quot;for any reason&quot; between the time of commission of the previous felony and the commission of the current felony, should not be literally interpreted to mean that incarceration for any reason at all other than for an unconstitutional conviction tolls the limitation period; such a position is plainly unreasonable.  The statute was not intended to be employed to permit the State to extend the 10-year limitation on prior violent felonies for an unjustified period of incarceration resulting from a flawed conviction under an indictment which was ultimately dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school districts appealed from the orders of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Department (New York), which reversed judgments of the trial court and granted defendant town supervisors' motions to dismiss the school district's complaints for failure to state a cause of action for money had and received on the grounds that the school districts had received the principal amounts owned under the Suffolk County Tax Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the school districts' contention that the statutory scheme was self-executing and that a town's obligation to make each payment by the cut-off date as determined by the statute arose automatically. Thus, when a town failed to make a payment by the required date it became liable in an action for money had and received, without the necessity of a demand and refusal, for the principal amount of the tax withheld with interest from the date of the improper withholding. Moreover, the town could not absolve itself from the automatically accruing liability for interest on the amounts improperly withheld simply by paying off the principal sum before the district could commence a lawsuit. The court likened the situation to a contract in which a debtor had agreed to pay interest on overdue amounts. In that situation, the receipt of partial payments applied on the principal did not relieve the debtor of the obligation to pay interest. The court held that from the moment the town failed to pay amounts due under the statute it was liable for both the principal and accumulated interest in the same way that the debtor who agreed to pay interest on overdue sums was liable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where defendant towns failed to disburse collected school tax moneys to plaintiff school districts at the times required by Suffolk County Tax Act &sect; 13 (a) and &sect; 14, the school districts may maintain a cause of action for money had and received to recover the unpaid accumulated interest notwithstanding their prior acceptance of the principal amounts of the taxes owed belatedly paid over to the districts by defendants on which that interest became due.  The statutory scheme is self-executing and a town's obligation to make each payment for the apportioned amount and by the cut-off date as determined by statute arises automatically. Thus, when a town fails to make a payment by the required date it becomes liable in an action for money had and received -- without the necessity of a demand and refusal -- for the principal amount of the tax withheld with interest from the date of the improper withholding. The school districts' right to the interest under the self-executing provisions of the Act survives their late receipt of the principal sums and it would be contrary to the statutory scheme and to the equitable principles underlying an action for money had and received to hold otherwise; such a result would permit the towns to enjoy the use of the districts' money interest free provided only that they have succeeded in paying the principal amounts before suit.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to recover from the government those unclaimed federal income tax refunds which, it alleged, had escheated to the State by operation of article XII-A of the Abandoned Property Law. The lower court found in favor of the government and the State appealed. The court affirmed and held that the challenged law was within Congress's constitutional powers and that Congress's evident intention to override the states' rights of escheat without reservation was to be given full effect. The State argued that the government had no interest in the funds once it determined that those funds represented overpayments that should be refunded to the taxpayers. The court held that the Omnibus Act, 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6408, was a permissible exercise of Congress's powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 18, because it implemented Congress's authority under the Sixteenth Amendment to lay and collect income taxes. Inasmuch as the statute had no exception for unclaimed refunds that may have already become subject to the State's escheat laws, the appeals court was correct in concluding that the State's petition should have been dismissed in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (26 USC &sect; 6408 [Omnibus Act]), which operates to nullify the States' formerly existing escheat rights to certain unclaimed Federal income tax refunds, was a permissible exercise of Congress's powers under the Necessary and Proper Clause of the US Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl 18) since it implements Congress's authority under the Sixteenth Amendment to &quot;lay and collect&quot; income taxes.  Accordingly, under the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution, the Omnibus Act must be recognized as a valid limitation on New York State's escheat rights to certain unclaimed Federal income tax refunds owed to New York citizens established by article XII-A of New York's Abandoned Property Law.</SPAN></P>

The language and legislative history of the statute demonstrate clearly that application of the statute to all of the unclaimed funds now held in the United States Treasury was precisely what Congress intended, and that intention ought to be given full effect. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an order that held that royalties from a book had to be deposited into escrow because the book was subject to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 632-a (1), petitioners, publisher and corporation sought review, contending that respondent board erred in finding the book subject to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 632-a (1). Petitioners argued that respondent board violated procedural due process. The court found that the statute was content-based and imposed a direct burden on speech, it singled out a category of speech based on subject matter and imposed special burdens on that category. Thus, the court reasoned that the statute had to be strictly scrutinized and unless it served a compelling governmental purpose and was narrowly tailored to accomplish that purpose, it was invalid. The court held that it was apparent from the preliminary negotiations that petitioner publisher believed the book's commercial value rested on the subject matter within the statute. The court concluded that the book was a publication subject to N.Y. Exec.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Crime Victims Board reasonably concluded that a book authored by a woman convicted of second degree murder is subject to Executive Law &sect; 632-a, which governs the distribution of moneys owing to a criminal or her representatives pursuant to contract with respect to reenactment or depiction of the crime, because the book contains her version of the killing and expressions of her &quot;thoughts, feelings, opinions or emotions&quot; regarding the crime of which she was convicted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &sect; 632-a [1]), in addition to a compilation of letters written by the children of imprisoned mothers.  It is apparent the publisher believed the book's commercial value rested on subject matter within the statute.  Before accepting the book, the publisher urged the author to expand it to include the crime and, before publishing it, the publisher advised the trade that the author's soon to be released book was &quot;a spellbinding story of her life in and out of prison,&quot; that the author kept a diary in prison &quot;full of new facts about her relationship with [the victim], her lover for over a decade whom she ultimately murdered,&quot; and stated that &quot;[the author] comes to terms with herself [in prison] and recounts why she murdered her lover.&quot; Press reports originating from the publisher characterized the book as &quot;the crime of the century -- by the woman convicted of committing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In concluding that a book authored by a woman convicted of second degree murder is subject to Executive Law &sect; 632-a because it contains her version of the killing and expressions of her &quot;thoughts, feelings, opinions or emotions&quot; regarding the crime, the Crime Victims Board did not violate procedural due process by failing to give petitioners, the publisher of the book and the author's assignee, proper notice of the offending passages.  The proposed determination issued by the Board contained a statement of the issues involved in the controversy, a detailed account of the facts which formed the basis for the Board's proposed determination, including page references to various passages in the book, and stated that the passages were found to contain &quot;both detailed reenactment as well as numerous expressions of [the author's] thoughts, feelings, opinions and emotions regarding the crime for which she was convicted.&quot; These preliminary findings were made available to petitioners prior to the administrative hearing and were sufficient to apprise them of the Board's claims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In concluding that a book authored by a woman convicted of second degree murder is subject to Executive Law &sect; 632-a, the Crime Victims Board did not violate procedural due process on the ground that the Board improperly acted as both prosecutor and Judge by investigating the facts, issuing a proposed determination and order, holding a hearing on that determination and, ultimately, upholding it.  The practice of combining investigative, prosecutorial and adjudicative functions in a single administrative agency or board is not improper and, without more, does not violate due process by creating an unconstitutional risk of bias.  The petitioners here must demonstrate that because of the practice the Board has been prejudiced by its investigation or for some reason is disabled from hearing and deciding the matter on the basis of the evidence, and the record in this case contains no evidence of such prejudice or disability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Executive Law &sect; 632-a, which requires the escrow of any profits paid to criminals for reenactment or depiction of their crimes for the benefit of the victims or legal representatives of the victims of the crimes, is content-based and imposes a direct burden on speech.  If the subject matter being addressed by the criminal's work falls within the terms of the statute, the statute imposes a burden on the criminal's speech by regulating the financial aspects of it.  Although the law does not foreclose the speaker's message, it imposes an economic disincentive or penalty for delivering it.  Accordingly, to withstand a constitutional challenge under the First Amendment, the statute must be strictly scrutinized and be shown to serve a compelling State interest and to be narrowly tailored to achieve that purpose.</SPAN></P>

Executive Law &sect; 632-a, which imposes a burden on speech by requiring the escrow of any profits paid to criminals for reenactment or depiction of their crimes for the benefit of the victims or legal representatives of the victims of the crimes, serves compelling State interests.  The statute provides not only a method for victims to obtain compensation and to place the burden of compensating the victim on the criminal whenever possible, but it is a codification of the fundamental equitable principle that criminals should not be permitted to profit from their wrongs and an expression of the penological concept which provides that victims expect and are entitled to &quot;retributive satisfaction&quot; from the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>

Executive Law &sect; 632-a, which imposes a burden on speech by requiring the escrow of any profits paid to criminals for reenactment or depiction of their crimes for the benefit of victims or legal representatives of the victims of the crimes, is narrowly tailored to meet the State's compelling interest in securing a victim's equitable right to be compensated from moneys earned by a criminal as a result of victimization. It creates a unique and identifiable resource and preserves it for the benefit of victims directly injured by a crime to compensate them for the damages sustained, gives them priority over the criminal's other creditors and extends the time within which a claim to the proceeds may be asserted by a victim.  The statute regulates only the criminal's receipt of money, not the right to speak about the crime and it does not impose a forfeiture of all profits -- it merely delays payment (&sect; 632-a [11] [e]).  Moreover, the statute does not prohibit anyone else from telling or publishing the criminal's story.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Executive Law &sect; 632-a, which requires the escrow of any profits paid to criminals for reenactment or depiction of their crimes for the benefit of the victims or legal representatives of the victims of the crimes, is not void for vagueness since the statute clearly delineates the class of individuals within its scope, the events that trigger its application, and the acts required for compliance and enforcement.  Moreover, the statute is not vague because questions exist as to its applicability to victimless crimes or to material which contains only a fleeting reference to the crime.  The Constitution does not require that a law be drafted with such specificity that it leaves no room for interpretation nor is it void for vagueness merely because situations may exist in which it should not be applied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Executive Law &sect; 632-a, which requires the escrow of any profits paid to criminals for reenactment or depiction of their crimes for the benefit of the victims or legal representatives of the victims of the crimes, does not violate the Free Speech Clause of the State Constitution (art I, &sect; 8) on the ground that there is lacking a &quot;genuinely close fit&quot; between the statute and its purpose because it is seriously underinclusive and inadequately designed to address the general problem of victim compensation.  The statute is not designed to compensate all victims, only those who possess claims to the proceeds earned by the criminal as a result of their victimization. Moreover, assuming without deciding, that article I, &sect; 8 does require some type of &quot;genuinely close fit&quot; between the statute and its purpose, this requirement is no more burdensome than requiring that the statute be narrowly tailored to meet its objective and section 632-a satisfies this test.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the former mortgagee alleged that it had been denied due process in that it was not given notice reasonably calculated to apprise it of the pendency of the foreclosure action. The court held that the former mortgagee's petition was time-barred because it had actual notice of the foreclosure within the statutory period and the city's statutory scheme for giving notice to property owners met the requirements of due process. The court determined that the former mortgagee had actual notice of the foreclosure action well within the two-year limitation period and was precluded from challenging the conclusive presumption raised by a properly recorded foreclosure deed.

The two-year Statute of Limitations applicable to petitioner mortgagee's constitutional challenge to New York City's &quot;notice-by-request&quot; procedure for in rem tax foreclosure actions (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 11-412 [c]) was not tolled by petitioner's pursuit of the New York City Board of Estimate procedure for release of forfeited property (Administrative Code &sect; 11-424 [a]).  Petitioner was free to bring its constitutional challenge regardless of its decision to pursue a release, and pursuit of that course should therefore have no tolling effect.</SPAN></P>

A challenge to the constitutionality of a notice provision, where the party had no timely notice, is not barred by the Statute of Limitations.  Moreover, the burden is on the party charged with giving notice, regardless of whatever &quot;fault&quot; may be assigned to the delinquent taxpayer; knowledge of delinquency in the payment of taxes is not equivalent to notice that a tax sale is pending.  Inasmuch as the status of owner is immaterial to the Statute of Limitations analysis, plaintiffs are not deemed to have had actual knowledge of the foreclosure action because such action is the logical sequel to tax delinquency. </SPAN></P>

The court held that pursuant to N.Y. Ins.

The state could neither appropriate the earnings to itself nor deprive the fund of assets that would generate income. The court's decision rested on the constitutionally based protection against legislative interference with vested rights.

The rights granted, which enjoy the constitutionally based protection against legislative interference with vested rights, attached to all contributions made to the fund while that legislation remained in effect, and thus the State may neither appropriate those earnings to itself nor deprive the fund of assets that would generate such income.  Accordingly, Laws of 1979 (ch 503), which provided that all of the income earned on all fund assets was to be credited to the fund and that, if the net value of the fund exceeded $ 240 million, the excess was to be credited to the State's general fund, and Laws of 1982 (ch 55), which required the transfer of $ 87 million of the fund's corpus to the State's general fund in exchange for a &quot;dry appropriation&quot; in an amount equal to or greater than the amount transferred, are invalid to the extent that they deprive the Property and Liability Insurance Security Fund of income on contributions made by insurers pursuant to the 1969 legislation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, L 1979, ch 503, &sect; 4; L 1982, ch 55, &sect;&sect; 90, 92 [4]; Insurance Law &sect; 7603).  When, as here, the Legislature grants to contributors property rights in the income of a fund and pledges the &quot;full faith and credit of the State of New York&quot; for the safekeeping of that fund it cannot simply ignore the pledge and abrogate those vested rights.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the State must account to the fund for the lost income and, until the moneys are returned to the fund, must continue to pay interest on the amount transferred at a rate equivalent to that which could be earned by the fund if those moneys were invested as authorized by Insurance Law former &sect; 333 (6).  As long as those moneys are generating a reasonable level of income for the fund, and as long as they are made available for the fund's purposes if that should become necessary, their use by the State does not offend the contributors' rights or breach the State's obligations and, thus, there is no need to order their immediate return.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother each owned 50 percent of the shares in a corporation which owned a tavern. Defendant was also the president of the corporation. Defendant's brother sold alcoholic beverages at the tavern to two individuals who were under the age of 19. The state charged defendant and his brother with violating N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect; 65(1). After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A denial of leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals by an individual Judge or Justice does not represent a determination on the merits barring further litigation of any claims which could have been litigated had the appeal been permitted.  Accordingly, on an appeal to the Court of Appeals from an Appellate Term order which affirmed defendant's conviction under a theory of vicarious liability of selling alcoholic beverages to minors (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &sect; 65 [1]; &sect; 130 [3]), defendant is not foreclosed from raising the vicarious liability question because his prior application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, which concerned the same issue, following Appellate Term's reversal of a pretrial order dismissing the charges, was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Intoxicating Liquors -- Sale to Minors -- No Vicarious Liability in Criminal Prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Section 65 (1) of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors, and section 130 (3), which makes a violation of that prohibition a misdemeanor, do not create a crime of &quot;vicarious liability&quot;, permitting conviction of a natural person for the acts of another solely because of the parties' business relationship. In the face of legislative silence on the point, a legislative intent to authorize prosecution of one person for another's criminal conduct will not be inferred.  Accordingly, an Appellate Term order which affirmed a judgment convicting defendant, a 50% shareholder and president of the corporate licensee, of violating section 65 (1) is reversed, and the complaint dismissed, where the evidence at trial established only that defendant's brother, the other 50% shareholder, had sold beer to two underage individuals on the licensed premises, and there was no proof that defendant was present during, or had any other connection with, the illicit sales for which he was charged.  </SPAN></P>

The tollway authority and officials contended that &sect; 2804(2) was unconstitutional. The court noted that although N.Y. Const. art. X, &sect; 5 provided that every public corporation should be subject to the supervision of the comptroller, the comptroller's authority to supervise their accounts was entirely discretionary. The court determined that N.Y. Pub. Auth.

The court stated that the fact that the State guaranteed the tollway authority's bonds and its power to issue nonguaranteed bonds was limited did not transform its funds into &quot;money under control of the State,&quot; and that the State's &quot;major concern&quot; in the tollway authority's business did not serve to justify the impermissible interference with the comptroller's discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) entered an order reversing a trial court order that dismissed a petition to annul a determination of appellant Board of Trustees of the Village of Pelham Manor (board) that denied respondent property owner's application to reconstruct a nonconforming dwelling that was destroyed by fire.

The court held that 1) the law disfavored nonconforming uses, rendering the property owner's burden high, 2) the proper test to evaluate a claim of reestablishing a nonconforming use after substantial destruction was functional interdependence, and 3) the issue of whether the combination of buildings functioned as a single, integrated, nonconforming use was one for the board, not the courts.</SPAN></P>

The petition in a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging a determination of appellant Village Board of Trustees, denying a property owner's application to reconstruct one of two nonconforming multiple-family dwellings, located on a single tax lot, that was destroyed by fire, based upon the Board's application of a Village Zoning Ordinance provision, which prohibits rebuilding of a nonconforming structure if it is damaged to the extent of more than 50% of its value, to the destroyed building alone rather than to the entire property, is dismissed.  The Board's determination that the combined apartment property was not devoted to a single, integrated, nonconforming use under the governing ordinance, and thus failed to qualify for the narrow exception recognized in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bobandal Realties v Worthington</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (21 AD2d 784, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">affd without opn</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;15 NY2d 788), was not arbitrary or capricious or an abuse of discretion.

The trial court dismissed contractor's complaint and rejected contractor's motion to amend its pleading to assert it later obtained the required license. The Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, and the court affirmed the judgments of the lower courts. The court held that N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant elected officials were indicted for violating various penal laws based on having assigned their staff employees to work on election campaigns and on having permitted &quot;no show&quot; employees to receive compensation from the state. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the counts related to the campaign workers, but sustained the counts concerning &quot;no show&quot; employees and both sides sought review. The court affirmed, ruling that when the activities at issue occurred, the legislature was aware that its members were using staff employees in political campaigns, but had not restricted the practice. For the purposes of a criminal prosecution, the controlling factor was that there was no law, which either expressly or as interpreted by the courts, declared such acts to be criminal. The court ruled that the Speech or Debate Clause of the N.Y. Const. did not immunize defendants from liability for larceny based on having filed false payroll statements for employees who were never intended to do anything but receive state monies. The allegations were sufficient to sustain these criminal counts under N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 155.30, 155.35, 175.35.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislature -- Immunity from Prosecution for Legislative Acts -- Acts Not Declared Criminal by Law -- Assignment of Senate Employees to Work on Political Campaigns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Minority Leader of the State Senate may not be prosecuted criminally for having assigned employees of his Senate staff, largely during the year 1986, to work on political campaigns for members of his party seeking election or reelection to the Senate, since, at the time when the activities at issue occurred, there was no law which, either expressly or as interpreted by the courts, declared the acts to be criminal.  Moreover, it cannot fairly be said that the Legislature otherwise forbade the conduct so that it could serve as a predicate for a conviction under general Penal Law provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislature -- Immunity from Prosecution for Legislative Acts -- Constitutional Prohibition against Use of State Moneys for Private Undertakings Not Predicate for Criminal Prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. NY Constitution, article VII, &sect; 8, which prohibits the use of State moneys for &quot;private undertakings&quot; and which has been construed to include partisan causes, does not support a criminal prosecution of the Minority Leader of the State Senate for having assigned employees of his Senate staff, largely during the year 1986, to work on political campaigns for members of his party seeking election or reelection to the Senate.  The constitutional prohibition limits the power of the Legislature to appropriate, but it does not create a hidden limitation in every appropriation so that any expenditure which is facially valid, but constitutionally prohibited, can be deemed an unauthorized expenditure and therefore a predicate for a criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislature -- Immunity from Prosecution for Legislative Acts -- No Immunity for Placing &quot;No-Show&quot; Employees on Senate Payroll</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Minority Leader of the State Senate and other defendants may be prosecuted criminally for having placed on the Senate payroll &quot;no-show&quot; employees, persons who did no work and were not expected to do anything to earn their salaries, on the theory that defendants filed false instruments when they certified on the payroll records that these employees performed &quot;proper duties&quot;, and committed larceny when they induced the State to rely on the false statements.  The allegations that these employees did nothing, that the defendants knew this, and that the defendants also knew that they had no duties are sufficient to sustain these criminal counts (Penal Law &sect;&sect; 155.30, 155.35, 175.35).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislature -- Immunity from Prosecution for Legislative Acts -- Separation of Powers -- Prosecution for Placing &quot;No-Show&quot; Employees on Senate Payroll</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The indictment and prosecution of the Minority Leader of the State Senate and other defendants for having placed on the Senate payroll &quot;no-show&quot; employees, persons who did no work and were not expected to do anything to earn their salaries, does not constitute an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of the Legislature in violation of the separation of powers doctrine on the ground that it will permit the executive and the courts to determine what are proper duties for legislative staff. No such inquiry is necessary in this case if, as alleged, these staff members did nothing and were not expected to perform any duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Legislature -- Immunity from Prosecution for Legislative Acts -- Speech or Debate Clause of State Constitution -- Prosecution for Placing &quot;No-Show&quot; Employees on Senate Payroll</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The prosecution of the Minority Leader of the State Senate and other defendants for having placed on the Senate payroll &quot;no-show&quot; employees, persons who did no work and were not expected to do anything to earn their salaries, is not prohibited by the legislative immunity granted pursuant to the Speech or Debate Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art III, &sect; 11).  No matter how far such immunity may extend under the State Constitution, it cannot be said that it was intended to provide a sanctuary for legislators who would defraud the State by knowingly placing on its payroll employees who were never intended to do anything but receive State moneys.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer working on an undercover narcotics operation observed another officer buy cocaine from defendant and defendant left before he was arrested. Subsequently, the officer who tried to buy the drugs from defendant observed him and sent the officer who observed the attempted transaction to identify defendant. Prior to trial, the prosecution did not serve defendant with a notice notifying him of their intention to introduce at trial testimony from the officer who previously identified him as required by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 710.30. At trial, the officer was allowed to testify and defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree. The intermediate appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that notice under &sect; 710.30 was required because the officer's second encounter was a police arranged identification. As it was an error to admit the officer's testimony because no hearing or notice was given, the court reversed, granted motion to suppress, and ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the intermediate appellate court affirming of defendant's conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Identification of Defendant -- Previous Identification by Police Officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An undercover police officer's November 18, 1986 identification of defendant as the suspect she observed taking part in an October 21, 1986 sale of a controlled substance to another undercover officer, which identification was made after she was directed to defendant's location by the other officer, who had fortuitously spotted defendant, constitutes a previous identification within the meaning of CPL 710.30 and, therefore, the officer's testimony as to that identification should have been precluded at defendant's trial since the People did not serve a CPL 710.30 notice with regard to that testimony.  The prior identification of defendant was police-arranged inasmuch as the identifying officer was specifically pointed to defendant's location by the other undercover officer. Further, since the prior identification cannot be said to have constituted the completion of an integral police procedure, and because of the significant lapse of time between the initial viewing and the later identification, the November 18th identification was not within the category of confirmatory identifications not ordinarily burdened or compromised by forbidden suggestiveness. Consequently, this case presents precisely the type of special circumstances which call for a CPL 710.60 (4) hearing and therefore implicate the notice requirements of CPL 710.30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Identification of Defendant -- Notice of Intention to Introduce Previous Identification by Police Officer -- Prior &quot;Knowledge&quot; of Suspect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A police officer's prior &quot;knowledge&quot; of a suspect, who she identified as the defendant, which derived from her viewing the person for only a few minutes and from a distance of no closer than 50 feet, cannot be said to be other than distant and fleeting and, thus, does not excuse the People's failure to give notice of intention to introduce at trial testimony regarding that police officer's previous identification of defendant pursuant to CPL 710.30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harmless and Prejudicial Error -- Erroneous Admission of Prior Identification Testimony</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the prosecution of defendant, who was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, the trial court's error in admitting a police officer's prior identification testimony into evidence despite the People's failure to serve a CPL 710.30 notice with regard to that testimony is not harmless.  Once that testimony is excluded, the People's case against defendant is left to depend almost entirely on the testimony of another police officer whose testimony was based upon an identification which occurred 28 days after that officer encountered the suspect.  In light of the possible effects this passage of nearly a month's time may have had on the jury's assessment of the reliability of that officer's testimony, it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that had the erroneously admitted testimony, which tended to significantly bolster that officer's testimony, been excluded, the outcome would not have been different.  </SPAN></P>

Rather, the section is neutral in its application and the burden it imposes on certain high officeholders does not depend upon political affiliation or political viewpoint.

Section 2604 (b) (15) is intended to eliminate conflicts of interest that arise when high public officials are simultaneously subject to the demands of both their constituencies and their political parties, to broaden opportunities for political and public participation, to reduce the opportunities for corruption inherent in dual officeholding, and, through all of these methods, to increase citizens' confidence in the integrity and effectiveness of their government.  These are legitimate governmental purposes and have been identified as such both judicially and legislatively.

The section is entirely neutral on issues involving party politics and does no more than prohibit the holding of both high political office and high public office at the same time.  It does not deprive political parties or their members of the right to associate with the individuals of their own choosing or the right to identify the people who constitute a political party. Nor does it prohibit political parties from expressing their opinions or selecting their own style of internal organization.  Section 2604 (b) (15) leaves political parties free to organize and participate in the election process without constraint.</SPAN></P>

Section 2604 (b) (15) permits city officials to engage in a broad range of personal or financial activity in support of a candidate or cause.

Section 2600, which sets forth the guiding purpose of the Charter's conflict of interest provisions (NY City Charter ch 68) and section 2603 (a), which delegates to the Board the general power to make such rules as are necessary under chapter 68, together provide reasonable standards to govern the Board's action in a limited and specified field for a stated purpose.  Thus, the conferral of authority upon the Board to promulgate those rules is not an unconstitutional delegation of rule-making authority.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. CPL 255.20 (4), which provides that any pretrial motion may be referred to a Judicial Hearing Officer (JHO) to hear and report, is not facially unconstitutional on the ground that it undermines or diminishes the County Court's exclusive power to decide in violation of NY Constitution, article VI, &sect;&sect; 10 and 11, which provide essentially for the organization and jurisdiction of County Courts.  The core of the statutory authorization retains for the Trial Judge the sole authority to &quot;determine&quot; all issues referred to a JHO by expressly withholding from the JHO the power to &quot;determine&quot; anything.  Nor do sections 10 and 11 of article VI of the NY Constitution expressly or impliedly prohibit referrals to JHOs to conduct suppression hearings.

While the suppression Judge did not personally listen to the witnesses' testimony, the court &quot;heard&quot; the motion in a customary juridical sense of that phrase.  Defendant's opportunity to present evidence and testimony to a neutral fact finder selected by the Judge who will decide the case and all its issues, coupled with the Trial Judge's de novo review powers and options, provides process that is due.  Moreover, the investigative and empirical record also manifest a substantial State interest in the objective of CPL 255.20 (4) to lessen delay, a recognized evil to the fair administration of the criminal justice system, which is furthered by the discretionary statutory procedure.</SPAN></P>

A lower appellate court affirmed. Upon review, the court affirmed the lower courts. The court held that the special law was constitutional because it did not require a home rule message under N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(2) where the law was not an act in relation to the property, affairs, or government of the city. The court found that there was no state interference with the city because the special law did not authorize secession, it did not authorize the voters of the borough to decide the secession issue, and it did not initiate seccession or commit the state to support it. The court noted that the special law merely allowed the borough to explore its publicized interest in secession, and any decision made by the borough was without force until further act of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

There is no State interference in New York City property, affairs or government.  Chapter 773 does not authorize secession; it does not authorize the voters of Staten Island to decide the secession issue; it does not initiate secession, or commit the State to support it; it does not represent any relinquishment by the Legislature of any power it may have with respect to secession; and it in no way circumscribes whatever protections exist in the State Constitution home rule provision with respect to an act formally triggering secession. Moreover, the legislative choice to allow Staten Island voters to express their views as to whether, and how, they might wish to separate from New York City -- while affording them no unilateral right to do so -- is a reasonable classification based on the distinct interest of that subdivision of the State and, therefore, does not violate equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated appeals, appellants, in one case adoptive parents and in the other a natural father, challenged the orders of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) which determined a biological unwed father's rights in adoption proceedings pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;111(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two adoption proceedings involving out-of-wedlock children whose birth mothers consented to their adoption by strangers were consolidated for appeal. The court analyzed the cases in light of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;111(1) which stated that an unwed father's consent to the adoption of his under-six-month-old child was required only where he had openly lived with the child or the mother for six continuous months immediately preceding the child's placement for adoption and had met other requirements. The court held that the &quot;living together&quot; requirement of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect;111 (1) (e), which cut off unwed fathers' parental interest by imposing as an absolute condition an obligation only tangentially related to the parental relationship, rendered the statute unconstitutional. One appellate division order, which denied the petition for adoption because respondent father did as much as possible to fulfill the statutory requirements and therefore was entitled to veto the adoption, was affirmed. The other order allowing adoption was reversed because the appellate division did not review the facts necessary to a determination of appellant father's parental responsibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the &quot;living together&quot; prong of New York's adoption statute rendered the statute unconstitutional, and affirmed the appellate division opinion which held that respondent father had a substantial parental interest entitling him to veto the adoption. The other appellate division order, which was entered against appellant father and in favor of the adoptive parents, was reversed and remitted for further review of the facts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father -- Constitutionality of Consent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Requiring Father to Live with Mother</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The requirement of Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e) that an unwed father openly live with his child's mother for six continuous months before the child's placement for adoption, as a condition to the father's right of consent to adoption, renders the statute infirm under the Federal Constitution.  The &quot;living together&quot; requirement of the statute, directed as it is principally to the father-mother relationship, neither legitimately furthers the State's substantial interest in adoption nor sufficiently protects the fundamental interest in a parental relationship of an unwed father who has promptly taken every available avenue to demonstrate that he is willing and able to enter into the fullest possible relationship with his infant child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father -- Right to Continued Parental Relationship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an adoption proceeding by strangers, an unwed father who has been physically unable to have a full custodial relationship with his infant child is entitled to the full measure of protection of his interest in the child under the Federal Constitution -- the right to a continued parental relationship absent a finding of unfitness -- so long as he promptly avails himself of all the possible mechanisms for forming a legal and emotional bond with his child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father -- Constitutionality of Consent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Requiring Father to Live with Mother</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e), which provides that an unwed father's consent to the adoption of his under-six-month-old child is required only where he has openly lived with the child or the mother for six continuous months immediately preceding the child's placement for adoption, openly acknowledged his paternity during such period, and paid reasonable pregnancy and birth expenses in accordance with his means, is unconstitutional in its entirety.  Although section 111 (1) (e) is challenged only as to the &quot;living together&quot; requirement, which renders the statute unconstitutional as neither legitimately furthering the State's interest in adoption nor protecting the father's interest in a parental relationship with the child, the format of the existing statute as well as contemporaneous expressions of intent indicate that the Legislature would not have wished to have the unchallenged portions of the statute stand alone as the sole measure of an unwed father's commitment to the child, entitling him to veto an adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father -- Criteria for Determining Right of Consent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In light of the declaration of unconstitutionality of Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e), and until there is new legislation, an unwed father seeking to establish the requisite interest in a parental relationship for a right of consent to the adoption of his infant child must demonstrate a willingness himself to assume full custody of the child -- not merely to block adoption by others, and a prompt manifestation of parental responsibility.  With respect to the former, any unfitness or waiver or abandonment would be considered by the courts, as they would whenever custody is in issue.  As to the latter, the father's manifestation of responsibility for the child is to be assessed in the six continuing months immediately preceding the child's placement for adoption; judicial evaluation of the unwed father's conduct in this key period may include such considerations as his public acknowledgement of paternity, payment of pregnancy and birth expenses, steps taken to establish legal responsibility for the child, and other factors evincing a commitment to the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Unwed Father -- Consent Required</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. An unwed father established the requisite interest in a parental relationship for a right to veto the adoption of his infant child under the applicable criteria prescribed by the Court of Appeals for the interim between that court's declaration of unconstitutionality of Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e) and new legislation, where the father himself seeking full custodial responsibility virtually from the time he learned of the mother's pregnancy, did everything possible to manifest and establish his parental responsibility.  The father's conduct included persistent and uniformly rebuffed expressions of concern, offers of support and requests for custody, as well as his efforts to establish paternity and secure custody -- within the six months preceding the infant's placement for adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father -- Determination of Requisite Interest in Parental Relationship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In light of the Court of Appeals declaration that Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e) is unconstitutional due to the statute's &quot;living together&quot; requirement, and its prescription of criteria to be considered by courts, until there is new legislation, in determining whether an unwed father has established the requisite interest in a parental relationship for a right of consent to the adoption of his infant child, a proceeding involving the adoption of an unwed father's infant child is remitted by the Court of Appeals to the Appellate Division for further review of the facts necessary to that determination of a requisite interest, since the Appellate Division, in concluding that the father had no right to veto the adoption because he failed to satisfy the statute's &quot;living together&quot; requirement, explicitly did not complete a review of the necessary facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- When Marriage Confers Automatic Right of Consent upon Father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In order for marriage to confer upon a father an automatic right of consent to adoption of his infant child, the marriage must take place by the time the child is born (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 24 [1]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee, who worked for third-party defendant construction company, brought suit against defendants contractor and owner after being injured at a construction site. He challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that he could not conduct ex parte interviews of current construction company employees under N.Y. Jud. App., Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-104(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Stating that a disciplinary rule did not have the force of law, the court wrote that in interpreting it, it was entitled to make its own decision in the interests of justice. Writing that the issue was which corporate employees should be deemed to be parties under the rule, which prohibited communications with represented parties, the court stated that the blanket rule against any contact with corporate employees adopted by the lower court was too broad, while the &quot;control group&quot; test, defining &quot;party&quot; to include only the most senior management exercising substantial control over the corporation, was too narrow. It concluded that the test that best balanced the competing interests was one that defined &quot;party&quot; to include corporate employees whose acts or omissions in the matter under inquiry were binding on the corporation or imputed to the corporation for purposes of its liability, or employees implementing the advice of counsel. Such a test, it stated, was consistent with the purpose of the rule, was rooted in developed concepts of the law of evidence and the law of agency, and was similar to that adopted by courts and bar associations throughout the country.</SPAN></P>

All other employees may be interviewed informally by adversary counsel.  With respect to the actual conduct of such interviews, it is assumed that attorneys would make their identity and interest known to interviewees and comport themselves ethically.  Accordingly, in a personal injury action, plaintiff's counsel is permitted to conduct ex parte interviews of employees of the corporate defendant who were merely witnesses to the underlying accident.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the commissioner of education (the commissioner), and intervenor-defendant, a teachers' association, appealed a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed an order that upheld plaintiff school administrators' constitutional challenge to N.Y.

The regulation excluded from eligibility for supplements those who, while also teaching, were primarily administrators and compensated under an administrative or supervisory salary schedule. Plaintiffs, certain school principals and other administrators (collectively, the administrators), who also taught classes, successfully challenged the regulation on grounds that it violated state and federal constitutional equal protection rights. That determination was upheld by an appellate court. On appeal, the court reversed the ruling that invalidated the regulation. The court held that the regulation drew a rational categorization that served the objectives of the program, which was to ensure salary supplements for under-paid teachers. The court held that the regulation permissibly reduced the diversion of limited program funds away from the needy teachers to relatively more highly compensated administrators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;8 NYCRR 175.35 (e) (1) (i), which, in defining an &quot;eligible teacher&quot; for purposes of salary supplements under the Excellence In Teaching (EIT) program (Education Law &sect; 1950 [15] [a]; &sect; 3602 [27] [a]), includes anyone who teaches class and is compensated under teachers' salary schedules, but excludes those who, while also teaching, are primarily administrators compensated under an administrative or supervisory salary schedule, is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11) as it draws a rational categorization serving the objectives of the EIT statute.  The regulation creates a functional and economic predicate for EIT eligibility which is authorized and consonant with the statutory language and the legislative intent which spurred the creation of EIT.  The line drawn between those paid as administrators and those paid as teachers, based on the categorical compensation method, is a distinction keyed at least somewhat proportionately to empirical data and is designed to assure that the essential statutory purpose of providing supplements to the salaries of teachers, as underpaid educators, is achieved.  Moreover, this distinction also preserves the residual EIT funds for the &quot;teachers-in-general&quot; group and reduces the diversion of these limited funds away from needy targeted teachers, paid as such, to relatively more highly compensated school administrators, paid as such.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The policy of the New York Public Service Commission authorizing utilities to pass along to ratepayers part of the cost of corporate charitable contributions is violative of the First Amendment of the US Constitution.  Under the First Amendment the ratepayers are entitled to protection against forced financial support for causes and messages personally distasteful to them, because that would render those individuals faithless to their own beliefs.  The extracted payments impose on the ratepayers, in some measure actually and in their estimation subjectively, particular and objectionable expressions and causes of a host of organizations.  Moreover, the utilities have not fulfilled their burden of demonstrating a compelling State interest for the imposition on their ratepayers, rather than on their shareholders, of the bill for their selected philanthropy.</SPAN></P>

The contract was not profitable and respondent tried to reform the contract price. The lower courts granted respondent's petition and directed reformation of the contract. The court reversed and held that the N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 66-c(1) did not require reformation of the contract because it was executed before the enactment of the statute. Appellant public service commission thus could not have &quot;required&quot; the contract pursuant to the then-nonexistent statute, nor dictated any of the contract's terms and conditions, including the conditioned statutory minimum payment. The contract was private, so the public service commission had no input on the terms or conditions of the contract.

The court held that the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2601 et seq., was likewise inapplicable because that regulatory scheme was not intended to affect contracts in place before the promulgation of the regulations, as this contract was.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioner, a private hydroelectric producer, who contracted to provide electricity for 20 years to New York State Electric and Gas Corporation at an agreed price structure, is not entitled under Public Service Law &sect; 66-c (1) to reformation of the contract to incorporate the statute's higher rate of payment, where the contract was executed by the parties more than 1 1/2 years before the enactment of section 66-c (1).  The statute provides that the Public Service Commission (PSC) &quot;shall require&quot; utilities &quot;to enter into long-term contracts&quot; with alternate energy producers &quot;under such terms and conditions as the [PSC] shall find just and economically reasonable&quot;; then, the mandatory minimum price is limited to purchased electricity referable to a contract the PSC initially &quot;required&quot; and whose terms it affected.  Since the parties' contract was executed prior to the enactment of section 66-c (1), the PSC could not have &quot;required&quot; it pursuant to the then-nonexistent statute, nor could the Commission have dictated any of the contract's &quot;terms and conditions&quot;, including the conditioned statutory minimum payment.  Moreover, the contracting parties' intent under this contract is clear and is therefore controlling.  No cause for judicial contractual reformation, bestowing new additional benefits under the statute, is shown on the ground that the deal did not turn out to be as advantageous as petitioner had hoped.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 73(8) was not retroactive as it prohibited a class of employees from engaging in certain activity after the statute's effective date. The court found that the legislative intent was that &sect; 73(8) applied to the employees who had left service prior to January 1, 1989 as the statute covered former employees, as well as other who would become former employees. The court found no disparate treatment as the employees did not prove absence of a rational basis for the disparities, identify a suspect class, or that they had a fundamental right to engage in the unrestricted practice of their professions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Retroactivity of &quot;Revolving Door&quot; Provisions of Public Officers Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Application of the strengthened &quot;revolving door&quot; provisions of Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which impose new and expanded restrictions on the business and professional activities of certain former government employees following their separation from State service, to plaintiffs, former State employees who left State service before the statute's January 1, 1989 effective date, does not render the statute &quot;retroactive&quot; in any true sense of that term.  As construed by New York State Ethics Commission Advisory Opinion 88-1, the statute merely prohibits a class of individuals from engaging in certain specified business and professional activities after the statute's effective date. A statute is not retroactive when made to apply to future transactions merely because such transactions relate to and are founded upon antecedent events.  Thus, the principles of statutory construction which require clear expression of a legislative intention to make a new provision retroactive are inapplicable in plaintiffs' actions challenging the opinion of the Ethics Commission that the new &quot;revolving door&quot; provisions were intended to apply to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Postemployment Business and Professional Activities -- Ex Post Facto Effect of &quot;Revolving Door&quot; Provisions of Public Officers Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), whose strengthened &quot;revolving door&quot; provisions impose new and expanded restrictions on the business and professional activities of certain former government employees following their separation from State service, does not constitute an ex post facto law in violation of U.S. Constitution, article I, &sect; 10, cl (1), with respect to plaintiffs, former State employees who left State service before the statute's January 1, 1989 effective date. A statute is not retroactive when made to apply to future transactions merely because such transactions relate to and are founded upon antecedent events.  Thus, in plaintiffs' actions challenging the constitutionality of section 73 (8), the court need not consider whether the restrictions on professional activities imposed by the statute are within the class of punitive measures contemplated by the Ex Post Facto Clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Postemployment Business and Professional Activities -- Applicability of &quot;Revolving Door&quot; Provisions of Public Officers Law to Executive Branch Employees Leaving State Service before Effective Date of Provisions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Legislature intended the new &quot;revolving door&quot; rules set forth in Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which impose new and expanded restrictions on the business and professional activities of certain former government employees following their separation from State service, to be applicable to plaintiffs and other former executive branch employees who left State service before the January 1, 1989 effective date of the statute.  The statutory prohibitions, which were to become effective on that date, were made applicable to any &quot;person who </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">has served as a state officer or employee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; (Public Officers Law &sect; 73 [8]).  Thus, on its face, the new statute encompassed employees who had previously served the State, as well as those who would become &quot;former&quot; employees in the future.  Further, the express exemption for legislative employees who left State service before January 1, 1989 (L 1987, ch 813, &sect; 26 [a]) furnishes strong proof that other State workers whose employment was terminated before that date </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">were</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intended to be included.  In addition, the absence of a savings clause -- or at least a specific legislative provision for a separate set of rules to govern former executive branch employees whose service was severed at some earlier point -- further supports the conclusion that such employees were intended to be covered under Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Officers -- Conflicts of Interest -- Postemployment Business and Professional Activities -- Application of Lifetime Ban on Certain Activities to Attorneys Who Left State Service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The new provisions of Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8), which impose a lifetime ban on former State officers or employees appearing or otherwise practicing before their former agencies in connection with a matter in which they directly participated during their State tenure, is not harsh or unreasonable as applied to plaintiff attorneys, former State employees who left State service prior to the statute's effective date and entered private practice.  The ban is designed to prevent former public servants from falling prey to one form of conflict of interest, or to the appearance of a conflict, and from taking unfair advantage of their insider's knowledge and contacts.  All admitted attorneys within this State, including plaintiffs, have long been subject to such a restriction under DR 9-101 (B) of the Code of Professional Responsibility.  The new provisions of section 73 (8) merely extend this reasonable limitation to nonattorneys formerly employed within the executive branch.  Furthermore, any hardship resulting from plaintiffs' prior engagement on forbidden matters has been mitigated by the Legislature's decision to postpone the statute's effective date for almost 17 months after its enactment, thereby enabling individuals such as plaintiffs, as well as their clients, to make suitable alternative arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Rational Basis Test -- Restrictions on Practice of Law by Attorneys Formerly Employed in Executive Branch of State Government -- Different Treatment of Former Legislative Branch Employees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Statutes or rules imposing reasonable restrictions on the right of admitted attorneys to practice law are subject to review, but only under the least exacting constitutional standard requiring a rational basis for the restriction.  Accordingly, plaintiffs, attorneys who were formerly employed in the executive branch of State government, and are subject to the strengthened &quot;revolving door&quot; provisions of Public Officers Law &sect; 73 (8) restricting the postemployment business and professional activities of certain former State employees, must demonstrate the lack of a rational basis for the statute's disparate treatment of former employees of the executive branch, as distinguished from those of the legislative branch who are subject to less stringent postemployment restrictions, in order to succeed in their argument that such disparate treatment violates their rights to equal protection under the State and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff interested individuals challenged an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of defendant city officials and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint alleging that defendants had violated the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act in approving an urban renewal project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city officials entered into a source agreement with a private builder to develop an urban renewal area, and the project underwent several levels of municipal approval before it could be implemented. After an environmental impact statement was prepared, the city departments designated as co-lead agencies for the project concluded that it would not trigger significant secondary displacement of local residents. Plaintiff interested individuals filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and the appellate division affirmed the supreme court's grant of defendants' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendants' lead agency had taken the required hard look at the issues concerning the project's potential impact on the secondary displacement of local residents and that its action in approving the project could not be characterized as arbitrary and capricious or as an abuse of discretion. The issue of secondary displacement had been raised at every level of the New York State Environmental Quality Review Act's process, and the court refused to substitute its judgment for the agencies' as to the accuracy of the data presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant city officials after finding that the comprehensive review taken with respect to an urban renewal project included the requisite hard look at the issue of secondary displacement of local residents.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In approving a proposed urban renewal project, the Board of Estimate of the City of New York (BOE), as the lead agency for purposes of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8), took the required &quot;hard look&quot; at the issues concerning the project's potential impact on the secondary displacement of local residents and made a &quot;reasoned elaboration&quot; of the basis for its determination that the project would not trigger significant secondary displacement; therefore, the BOE's action in approving the project cannot be characterized as arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.  Although the &quot;protected housing study&quot; submitted to the Department of City Planning (DCP), a co-lead agency, in response to that agency's request for additional information on the specific concerns about secondary displacement did not provide all the specific information requested by DCP, it cannot be said that the BOE's acceptance of the study's analysis in support of the conclusion that the project would not trigger significant secondary displacement was irrational; nor can the court substitute its judgment as to the accuracy of the data presented.  Further, although the study did not provide all current information on every dwelling unit in the study area, it did provide a basis for a reasoned consideration of the secondary displacement issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. With respect to the Board of Estimate of the City of New York's approval of a proposed urban renewal project, the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8) was not violated because the raw data of a &quot;protected housing study&quot; concerning the potential impact of the project on the secondary displacement of local residents was not included in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS).  There is no requirement that the FEIS contain all the raw data supporting its analysis so long as that analysis is sufficient to allow informed consideration and comment on the issues raised.  The FEIS analysis for this project, which emphasized that the project would not alter the already established displacement trends in the study area, was sufficient to allow such informed consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Consideration of Secondary Displacement Effect of Urban Development Project on Low-Income Housing -- Consideration of Other Unrelated Development Projects in Same Geographic Area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In approving a proposed urban renewal project, the failure of the Board of Estimate of the City of New York, as the lead agency for purposes of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8), to consider the cumulative impact on secondary displacement of the proposed project and other, unrelated development projects in the same geographic area does not render the agency's consideration of the issue of secondary displacement deficient.  While it was within the agency's discretion to consider the cumulative impact of such unrelated projects, the agency was not required to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation -- Environmental Quality Review -- Approval of Urban Development Project by Lead Agency -- Propriety of Designation of Non-Decision-Making Agencies as Co-Lead Agencies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In approving a proposed urban renewal project, the Board of Estimate of the City of New York (BOE) properly acted as lead agency for purposes of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8 [SEQRA]), notwithstanding the BOE's designation of two non-decision-making agencies -- the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Department of City Planning (DCP) -- as co-lead agencies.  The BOE reviewed and evaluated the draft environmental impact statement and the final environmental impact statement (FEIS), conducted public hearings on the FEIS, determined that the project would not have a significant impact on the environment, and ultimately made the final decision to approve the project.  Although the DCP and DEP were undeniably involved in the SEQRA review process, the BOE merely relied upon the expertise of these agencies, while fully retaining and exercising its role as the lead agency assessing the environmental impact of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Zoning Amendments -- &quot;Well-Considered Plan&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Land use changes approved for an urban renewal project by the Board of Estimate of the City of New York, as the lead agency for purposes of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (ECL art 8), were in accordance with a well-considered plan for the City of New York despite the project's failure to provide for low-income housing. Such zoning amendments meet the general requirement for a well-considered plan when, as here, they are carefully studied, prepared and considered and are adopted for a legitimate government purpose.  Moreover, there is no requirement that a particular development project include low-income housing. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff ADC recipients filed suit against defendants, State of New York and New York City Commissioners of Social Services, alleging that the shelter allowances they received were inadequate.

On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the appellate court. The court examined the legislative intent of N.Y. Soc. Serv.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services -- Aid to Dependent Children -- Duty of State Commissioner of Social Services to Establish Shelter Allowances Bearing Reasonable Relation to Cost of Housing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social Services Law &sect; 350 (1) (a), which requires the State Commissioner of Social Services to establish &quot;adequate&quot; shelter allowances for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (ADC), imposes a statutory duty on the State Commissioner to establish shelter allowances that bear a reasonable relation to the cost of housing in New York City.  Section 350 (1) (a), as well as sections 344 (2) and 350-j (3) of the Social Services Law, manifest the Legislature's determination that family units should be kept together in a home-type setting and impose a duty on the Department of Social Services to establish shelter allowances adequate for that purpose.  A schedule establishing assistance levels so low that it forces large numbers of families with dependent children into homelessness does not meet the statutory standard. Accordingly, a claim by plaintiffs, recipients of public assistance in the form of ADC residing in New York City whose shelter costs exceed the maximum allowance payable to them under the Department of Social Services schedules (18 NYCRR 352.3), that the State Commissioner has failed to perform that duty presents a justiciable controversy involving the alleged failure of the executive branch of government to comply with the directions of the legislative branch and, therefore, an Appellate Division order granting motions by defendants, the State and City Commissioners of Social Services and plaintiffs' landlords, to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action is reversed, and the motions are denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county justice sought review of a determination of respondent state judicial conduct commission that petitioner should have been removed from the office of county justice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent state judicial conduct commission found that petitioner county justice issued a warrant of arrest pertaining to a dishonored check given to petitioner's husband, the complainant, by an offender. Despite her relationship to the complainant, petitioner refused to disqualify herself, committed the offender to jail in lieu of bail, and failed to appoint counsel at arraignment. Respondent also found that petitioner improperly issued an order directing an offender charged with harassment to pay child support, sent personal communications on court stationary, and struck an offender across the face with a book. Respondent determined that the sanction of removal from office was appropriate. On review, the court accepted the determined sanction. The court did find that the proof was insufficient to sustain a finding of misconduct under the count charging her with ordering the child support. However, the court found that petitioner's other contentions regarding her guilt were without merit. The court also found that the sanction was not too severe.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) reversing dismissal of indictment for promoting a sexual performance by a child pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant procured child pornography from an undercover officer, and was charged with promoting a sexual performance by a child pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 263.15. Trial court threw out the charge, finding that the statute punished the distribution of child pornography, and not its acquisition for personal use, but lower court reinstated charge. Court found that the statutory language of &quot;promoting,&quot; which was defined to include &quot;procuring,&quot; included defendant's actions, reading the statute according to its plain language and the legislative history, which indicated the legislature was not concerned solely with punishing persons who profited from the distribution of child pornography. Statute was not unconstitutional, as defendant was not charged merely with possession of the material.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Affirmed, as defendant was not charged merely with the possession of child pornography, and because statute was to be read according to its plain meaning and in view of its legislative history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Indictment -- Promoting Sexual Performance by Child -- What Constitutes &quot;Procurement&quot; -- Acquisition of Child Pornography for Personal Consumption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The procurement of child pornography for personal use falls within the ambit of Penal Law &sect; 263.15, which criminalizes the promotion of a sexual performance by a child.  Although the term &quot;procure&quot; is not defined in the Penal Law, the leading definition commonly assigned to the term is &quot;to get possession of: obtain, acquire * * * esp: to get possession of by particular care and effort&quot;.  Understood in this sense, the term &quot;procure&quot; as used in Penal Law &sect; 263.00 (5) defines &quot;promote&quot; for the purposes of Penal Law &sect; 263.15 as simply the acquisition of child pornography, whether for personal consumption or for distribution to others.  Moreover, the legislative history of Penal Law article 263 indicates that the Legislature intended to employ broad measures to eradicate child pornography in all its forms -- that history contains no suggestion that the consumers of such material were to be excluded from the reach of those measures.  Consistent with its efforts to eradicate the social evil of child pornography, Penal Law &sect; 263.15 is directed at the consumers of child pornography as well as at its manufacturers and distributors.  Accordingly, the Appellate Division correctly reinstated the indictment charging defendant with promoting a sexual performance by a child in violation of section 263.15 based on allegations that defendant, knowing the contents thereof, procured child pornography through the mail, and procured child pornography in his home from an undercover officer. </SPAN></P>

In a proceeding to review a determination of the State Tax Commission sustaining a corporate franchise tax assessment imposed against petitioner, which publishes magazines for distribution nationwide, a judgment of the Appellate Division, which annulled the determination and granted the petition, should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the opinion thereat, which concluded that the difference in treatment between the print media and the broadcast media under 20 NYCRR 4-4.3 (f) (2), whereby the latter were permitted to allocate receipts for advertising according to the percentage of listeners or viewers they had in each State, while the print media were required to treat all advertising revenues as originating in New York if the commercial contracts were executed in New York, violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press; that a tax that singles out the press for differential treatment is presumptively unconstitutional; that a taxing scheme which taxes some members of the press but exempts others does not escape First Amendment scrutiny even if businesses outside of the press are also not exempt; that given the different treatment between the two types of media, it was incumbent upon respondent Commission to show that the regulation was necessary to serve a compelling State interest, and that respondent failed to make such a showing.</SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as respondent Commission has not established that requiring repayment to petitioner of almost $ 1.75 million in taxes, interest and penalties would impose any undue burden, the court's decision, based upon amendment to the Commission's rules and a session law (L 1981, ch 103, &sect; 1), may be applied retroactively, notwithstanding that the methodology for assessing the tax had been approved prior to the statutory and regulatory changes, since precluding repayment would leave petitioner virtually remediless. After the rule was changed, petitioner had little reason to pursue this expensive and lengthy litigation except to recover the sums improperly charged against it.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to coercion in the first degree, conspiracy in the fifth degree, attempted coercion in the second degree, official misconduct, attempted bribe-receiving in the second degree, and perjury. The appellate court affirmed convictions of the trial court, and defendants sought review and contended that the New York State Organized Crime Task Force (NYSOCTF) lacked authority to be an applicant for eavesdropping warrants. Pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Act), 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510 et seq., minimum constitutional criteria were imposed upon the states for electronic surveillance. The Act limited those who could apply for eavesdropping warrants to the principal prosecuting attorney or any subdivision thereof, under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2516(2).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. CPL 700.05 (5), in expressly including the Director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force (OCTF) as a law enforcement officer authorized to apply for eavesdropping warrants, is consistent with its Federal enabling statute (18 USC &sect; 2516 [2]), which limits those who may be applicants for court-authorized eavesdropping warrants to &quot;[the] principal prosecuting attorney of any State, or the principal prosecuting attorney of any subdivision thereof, if such attorney is authorized by a statute of that State&quot;.  The CPL 700.05 (5) authorization of the Deputy Attorney-General in charge of the OCTF does not impermissibly broaden the literal letter and the overarching purpose of 18 USC &sect; 2516 (2).  The State and Federal statutes are specific and in harmony and, therefore, the New York applicant authorization statute is valid.  Accordingly, in light of the State statute's validity, and since there was no infirmity in the statute's utilization to secure eavesdropping warrants obtained by OCTF's Director in accordance with the valid State statute and procedures as part of the OCTF's investigation into organized crime infiltration of Long Island's refuse-carting industry, evidence garnered pursuant to those warrants was properly held admissible and not suppressible in the prosecution of defendants for coercion and conspiracy arising out of the OCTF's investigation.</SPAN></P>

The sealing of six eavesdropping tapes was accomplished &quot;immediately&quot; within the intendment of CPL 700.50 (2) where, although the tapes were not sealed immediately upon the expiration of the warrant periods, the prosecutor in each instance made alternative arrangements in advance with court approval and directions.  On five of these six occasions, the period expired at midnight on a Saturday night and, in preexpiration meetings, the issuing Justice directed that the tapes be presented for sealing on the first business day after expiration. In the sixth instance, the prosecutor immediately presented the tapes for sealing but was informed by court officials of the issuing Justice's unavailability at that particular moment.  The prosecutor complied with the issuing Justice's direction to return the next day and the tapes were then sealed. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) vacated an ex parte order of the trial court that granted appellant medical center authorization to administer blood transfusions to respondent patient against her express refusal of such transfusions. The medical center appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was a Jehovah's Witness and indicated on her admission forms that she expressly refused any treatment that included blood transfusions. Subsequent to a Caesarian birth and complications, the patient again refused blood transfusions. The medical center sought a court order granting permission to administer blood transfusions. The trial court granted the order and the medical center administered the blood transfusions. The court held that the trial court order violated the patient's rights to due process and the patient's right to refuse consent to medical treatment. Because the patient had a right to refuse medical treatment, the court did not consider the patient's constitutional right to religious freedom. The patient was a competent adult who had a right to determine the course of her own treatment, including the right to decline blood transfusions. There was no showing that the State had a superior interest in preventing the patient from exercising her right to consent to medical treatment.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Supreme Court should not have signed an order authorizing a hospital to administer blood transfusions to a patient over the patient's personal objections, without giving the patient or her husband notice and an opportunity to be heard.  Applications for court-ordered medical treatment affect important rights of the patients and should generally comply with due process requirements of notice and the right to be heard before the order is signed.  The patient's condition was not so grave that there was no opportunity for prior notice and a hearing.  In addition, the patient's medical file recorded a long-standing unequivocal personal decision to decline transfusions. Since three hours elapsed between the time the application was made and the time the order was signed and an additional six hours passed before it was executed, there was ample time to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing, however informal.  Moreover, the emergency doctrine, which permits a doctor or a hospital to provide treatment to a patient in need of immediate medical attention, who is unconscious or otherwise unable to consent, without first obtaining a court order, is inapplicable here because the patient clearly stated before admission to the hospital and throughout her stay that she would not consent to blood transfusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals and Asylums -- Right of Competent Adult Patient to Decline Blood Transfusions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A competent adult has a personal common-law and statutory right (Public Health Law &sect;&sect; 2504, 2805-d) to determine the course of his or her own medical treatment. This right is not absolute, however, and may have to yield to superior State interests in certain circumstances.  Accordingly, Supreme Court should not have authorized a hospital to give blood transfusions to an adult Jehovah's Witness who refused to consent to blood transfusions prior to the delivery of her baby and who persisted in the refusal after losing a substantial amount of blood following the birth of the child.  The patient, as a competent adult, had a right to determine the course of her own treatment, which included the right to decline blood transfusions, and there is no showing that the State had a superior interest in preventing her from exercising that right because she is a young, otherwise healthy person facing a risk of death which could be completely eliminated by the transfusion, or because she is a parent.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New Car Lemon Law alternative arbitration mechanism (General Business Law &sect; 198-a [k]) does not violate NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 2 by depriving automobile manufacturers of their right to a trial by jury with respect to the statute's remedy of a refund of full purchase price of a vehicle (General Business Law &sect; 198-a [c] [1]).  The constitutional guarantee of a jury trial in article I, &sect; 2 applies to all cases afforded a jury trial under the common law prior to 1777, i.e., those in which the nature and substance of the relief requested was legal as opposed to equitable, and to all cases to which the Legislature extended a right to a jury trial prior to 1894. The Lemon Law refund remedy is an action seeking a rescission and restoration of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">status quo ante</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, similar to an action for restitution, and is equitable in nature.  It would not have been triable under the common law and is not entitled to a jury trial under NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 2.

The constitutional guarantee of a jury trial in article I, &sect; 2 applies to all cases afforded a jury trial under the common law prior to 1777, i.e., those in which the nature and substance of the relief requested was legal as opposed to equitable, and to all cases to which the Legislature extended a right to a jury trial prior to 1894.  The replacement remedy provided by the Lemon Law is analogous to specific performance; it is designed to produce, as nearly as practicable under the circumstances, the same performance promised under the contract.  The remedy is equitable in nature and would not be subject to a jury trial under common law. Accordingly, plaintiffs are not entitled to a jury trial under NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 2 when the consumer seeks the replacement remedy under General Business Law &sect; 198-a (c) (1).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The compulsory arbitration mechanism implemented by the New Car Lemon Law (General Business Law &sect; 198-a [k]) does not abridge the constitutionally guaranteed jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 7 [a]) insofar as it limits the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to CPLR article 75 review when a consumer elects compulsory arbitration in the first instance.  The Supreme Court has lost no jurisdiction as a result of General Business Law &sect; 198-a (k) because the jurisdiction secured to it by the Constitution does not attach until a claim is made litigable, that is, made the subject of a suit or litigation in a court of law.  If the consumer chooses to litigate a Lemon Law claim, the Supreme Court has full jurisdiction to adjudicate it.  If the consumer chooses arbitration, the claim becomes litigable when either party seeks review of the award.  Although the type of adjudication differs when a consumer elects arbitration, the statute does not withhold or abridge the court's &quot;general original jurisdiction&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment upon a verdict convicting defendant of attempted rape, attempted sodomy, and sexual abuse of a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the validity and application of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 65, which authorized a trial court, under specified circumstances in certain sex crime cases, to permit a child witness to testify from a testimonial room over live, two-way, closed-circuit television. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 65 was constitutional on its face, but only when the presumption of constitutionality was applied, and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 65.20(10) was read as embodying the additional requirements of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 65.10(1), which included that the likelihood that the child witness, as a result of &quot;extraordinary circumstances,&quot; would suffer severe mental or emotional harm if required to testify at a criminal proceeding without the use of live, two-way, closed-circuit television must be established by clear and convincing evidence. The court concluded that it was reversible error for the trial court to allegedly make such a finding based only on its observations of the witness over a two-hour period during which she was in the courtroom, without other evidence relating to the witness's mental or emotional response to the alleged incident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order affirming the judgment convicting defendant was reversed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Face-to-Face Confrontation between Defendant and Witness -- Use of Closed-Circuit Television for Certain Child Witnesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. CPL article 65, which authorizes a trial court, under specified circumstances, in certain sex cases, to permit a child witness to testify from a testimonial over live two-way closed-circuit television in defendant's absence, does not necessarily violate the defendant's constitutional right of confrontation. Face-to-face confrontation with the defendant is not an absolute requirement under either the Federal or State Constitution.  A defendant's right of confrontation must occasionally give way to considerations of public and the necessities of the case.  The use of closed-circuit television technology is permitted where an appropriate individualized showing of necessity is made, and the infringement on defendant's confrontation rights is kept to a minimum.  This rule strikes a proper balance between the State's manifest interest in protecting the child witness in child sexual abuse prosecutions and the defendant's right to confront adverse witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Face-to-Face Confrontation between Jury and Witness -- Use of Closed-Circuit Television for Certain Child Witnesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. CPL article 65, which authorizes a trial court, under specified circumstances, in certain sex crime cases, to permit a child witness to testify from a testimonial room over live two-way closed-circuit television is not facially invalid because it permits the child to testify from a place removed from the courtroom and thereby avoid face-to-face confrontation with the jury.  A statute which tolerates some infringement of the witness-jury confrontation right can meet constitutional requirements provided it contains sufficient limitations and safeguards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Constitutionality of Statute Permitting Use of Closed-Circuit Television for Certain Child Witnesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. CPL article 65, which authorizes a trial court, under specified circumstances, in certain sex crime cases, to permit a child witness, who has been declared by the court to be vulnerable (CPL 65.20 [1], [10], to testify from a testimonial room over live two-way closed-circuit television, does not, on its face, offend the defendant's rights under the State or Federal Constitution to have the witness confront the jury or the defendant, but only when the presumption of constitutionality is applied and CPL 65.20 (10) is read as embodying the additional requirements of CPL 65.20 (1).  The Legislature in drafting article 65 provided for a two-way simulcast of the child witness's testimony so that the curtailment of defendant's confrontation rights would be minimized.  Moreover, article 65 was drawn to require an individualized showing of necessity for use of the procedures based on clear and convincing evidence; the standards for an individualized showing of necessity are sufficiently stringent to meet the facial attack on article 65.  When the determination of vulnerability is sought on a motion made before trial, the requirements for a showing of necessity for the determination of vulnerability contained in CPL 65.10 (1) are clearly adequate on their face to satisfy constitutional mandates.  However, when the determination of vulnerability is sought during the course of a trial, CPL 65.20 (10), if read literally, appears to authorize a court to make its determination solely from its &quot;own observations&quot;.  To avoid the constitutional infirmity that such a literal construction of CPL 65.20 (10) would produce, that section can and should be construed as requiring the same findings by clear and convincing evidence </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPL 65.10 [1]) as required for a determination of vulnerability made pursuant to a pretrial motion under CPL 65.20 (1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Witnesses -- Use of Closed-Circuit Television for Certain Child Witnesses -- Determination of Vulnerability -- Clear and Convincing Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. For purposes of permitting a child witness to testify from a testimonial room over live two-way closed-circuit television (CPL art 65), CPL 65.10 (1) and its procedural requirements apply to all determinations of vulnerability under CPL 65.20.  Thus, a determination of vulnerability, either under CPL 65.20 (1) or (10), must be supported &quot;by clear and convincing evidence&quot; and the &quot;severe mental or emotional harm&quot; must be the &quot;result of extraordinary circumstances&quot; (CPL 65.10 [1]).  Accordingly, the requirements of the statute were not satisfied where the trial court's determination of vulnerability under CPL 65.20 (10) was based solely on its observations of the child witness over the two-hour period she was in the courtroom and no other evidence relating to the child's mental or emotional response to the alleged incident had been adduced.  The court's subjective impressions, in this case, provide an insufficient basis for a factual finding required to be predicated on &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot;.  There was no legal proof in the record from which an appeals court could determine whether the disputed finding of &quot;severe mental or emotional harm&quot; was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Moreover, the substantive requirements of the statute -- i.e., what must be found for a determination of vulnerability -- were not met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Harmless and Prejudicial Error -- Permitting Use of Closed-Circuit Television for Testimony of Child Victim in Sex Crime Case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In the prosecution of defendant for attempted rape and related crimes involving a four-year-old, the trial court's error in allowing the victim to testify using CPL article 65 procedures without having a sufficient basis to make the required threshold determination of vulnerability (CPL 65.10 [1]; 65.20) was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  On this record, it cannot be concluded that there is no reasonable possibility that the error in permitting the jurors to view the victim's televised testimony of the intimate details of the alleged sexual abuse contributed to defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Witnesses -- Expert Witness -- Sex Crime Case Involving Child Victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In the prosecution of defendant for attempted rape and related crimes involving a four-year-old girl, the trial court acted within its discretion in permitting the testimony of an expert witness in the fields of child sexual abuse and child development as to her diagnosis of the victim and the reactions of child sexual abuse victims to courtroom procedures, and in ruling that the reactions of a four-year-old victim of sexual abuse are not within the ken of a typical juror, and are thus a proper subject for expert testimony. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the owner of a state-financed housing project until the property was lost in foreclosure. Respondent, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, established the rental rates to be charged to the project's low-income tenants. Appellant filed the instant claim alleging that the rental rates established since the project's opening in 1975 resulted in its inability to pay its mortgage and constituted a &quot;taking&quot; of the property. The trial court ruled that the claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. The court affirmed, holding that the instant claim accrued, at the latest, in 1988 following the last rental rate determination which appellant challenged, and the nearly simultaneously commenced mortgage foreclosure action. The alleged deprivation of the economically viable use of the property was certainly reasonably ascertainable by that time. Thus, the claim, filed over eight years later, was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of a determination of respondent Tax Appeals Tribunal (New York), which denied petitioner's claim for a refund of a corporation tax assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought tax refunds, contending it was subject to tax as supplier under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 186. Division of Taxation denied refund claims, finding petitioner did not qualify as transportation corporation because it derived over 50 percent of gross receipts from sale of natural gas as merchant. On administrative review to respondent, petitioner additionally argued that if it was subject to taxation under &sect; 186, that provision was unconstitutional as applied because statute imposed franchise tax upon petitioner's unapportioned gross receipts. Respondent affirmed findings and petitioner appealed, arguing gross receipts tax under &sect; 186 was constitutionally flawed because tax was not fairly apportioned and violated dormant Commerce Clause. The court affirmed, holding statute was internally and externally consistent, because it imposed tax only upon gross earnings from all sources within state, and petitioner did not show tax reached beyond portion of value fairly attributable to economic activity within state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 186 imposed a tax only upon gross earnings from all sources within state and there was thus no risk of multiple taxation, and petitioner failed to demonstrate tax reached beyond portion of value fairly attributable to economic activity within state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Tax on Natural Gas Suppliers - Commerce Clause - Internal and External Consistency </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petitioner, an out-of-State corporation which was required to pay franchise taxes as a gas supplier pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 186 for the years 1989 through 1991 because the gross receipts from its sales of natural gas as a merchant exceeded the gross receipts from its transportation of natural gas for third parties as a common carrier through its interstate pipeline system, has failed to meet its heavy burden of demonstrating that Tax Law &sect; 186 is facially unconstitutional.  A tax satisfies the requirement of the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]) that it be &quot;fairly apportioned&quot; if it is both internally and externally consistent.  Internal consistency is preserved when the imposition of a tax identical to the one in question by every other State would add no burden to interstate commerce that intrastate commerce would not also bear.  External consistency looks to the economic justification for the State's claim upon the value taxed to discover whether a State's tax reaches beyond that portion of value that is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing State.  Tax Law &sect; 186 satisfies the internal consistency test, since the statute imposes a tax only upon &quot;gross earnings from all sources&quot; within the State and does not seek to tax petitioner's gross earnings regardless of the out-of-State activity that contributed to those earnings. Furthermore, petitioner has also failed to demonstrate that the tax imposed by the statute is externally inconsistent.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction for criminal contempt and aggravated harassment in the Supreme Court, Monroe County (New York), appellant argued that his prosecution on the contempt charges constituted double jeopardy in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 40.20(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for criminal contempt and aggravated harassment arose from having telephoned his ex-wife on five occasions, in violation of an order of protection. Appellant argued his criminal prosecution for disobeying the City Court order of protection was a subsequent prosecution for the same offense of which he was previously found guilty in the Family Court proceeding, which constituted double jeopardy. Respondent, the People, contended that the criminal charge of contempt in the first degree contained an additional element, which set it apart from the Family Court charges. The court reversed, stating that the reasonable doubt standard in Fam. Ct. Act art. 8, combined with a subsequent incarceration, rendered the Family Court proceeding so punitive in nature that it could not be viewed as civil in nature. However, there was no need to join the aggravated harassment charges with the contempt charges because those crimes had different elements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction reversed, because the reasonable doubt standard in the Family Court act, combined with a subsequent incarceration, rendered the Family Court proceeding so punitive in nature that it could not be viewed as civil in nature, and the subsequent prosecution in City Court violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Former Jeopardy - Criminal Contempt Prosecution Based upon Same Underlying Conduct Involved in Prior Family Court Contempt Proceeding - &quot;Same Elements&quot; Test </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's criminal contempt prosecution (Penal Law &sect; 215.51 [c]) for having violated a City Court order of protection by making five harassing telephone calls to his ex-wife violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy where defendant had previously been found guilty of contempt in a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 846-a, resulting in the imposition of a six-month jail term, for having willfully violated a Family Court order of protection based upon the same underlying conduct.  For double jeopardy purposes, the incarceration penalty in article 8 of the Family Court Act must be viewed as a criminal prosecution. In addition, since the same conduct that provided the basis for the Family Court proceeding also formed the basis of the criminal contempt prosecution, the two criminal prosecutions must be deemed to be for the same offense under the &quot;same elements&quot; double jeopardy test.  Consequently, defendant should not have been tried in criminal court for criminal contempt subsequent to the Family Court finding that he violated a court order of protection.  Once defendant was found guilty of the lesser included Family Court offense, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited the subsequent prosecution for the greater offense. Furthermore, the fact that the criminal contempt charges stem from a City Court order of protection does not remove the double jeopardy bar, since the criminal contempt and the Family Court contempt proceedings still involved the same statutory elements being applied to the same conduct.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Former Jeopardy - Statutory Double Jeopardy Bar - Criminal Contempt Prosecution Based upon Same Underlying Conduct Involved in Prior Family Court Contempt Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant's criminal contempt prosecution (Penal Law &sect; 215.51 [c]) for violating a City Court order of protection by making five harassing telephone calls to his ex-wife violated the statutory prohibition against double jeopardy ( CPL 40.20 [2] [b]) where defendant had previously been found guilty of contempt in a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 846-a, resulting in the imposition of a six-month jail term, for having willfully violated a Family Court order of protection based upon the same underlying conduct.  Under the statutory double jeopardy bar, a &quot;person may not be separately prosecuted for two offenses based upon the same act or criminal transaction unless: ... [e]ach of the offenses as defined contains an element which is not an element of the other, and the statutory provisions defining such offenses are designed to prevent very different kinds of harm or evil.&quot; Defendant's prosecution on the criminal contempt charges satisfies both prongs of the statutory test.  The Family Court and City Court orders of protection were designed to prevent precisely the same &quot;kinds of harm or evil,&quot; to wit, harassment of defendant's ex-wife by prohibited contact with her as well as vindicating the authority of the court that issued the order.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Former Jeopardy - Separate Prosecution of Jointly Prosecutable Offenses - Aggravated Harassment and Criminal Contempt </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Although defendant's criminal contempt prosecution (Penal Law &sect; 215.51 [c]) for violating a City Court order of protection by making five harassing telephone calls to his ex-wife violated the constitutional and statutory ( CPL 40.20 [2] [b]) prohibitions against double jeopardy where defendant had previously been found guilty of contempt in a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 846-a based upon the same underlying conduct, thereby requiring reversal of defendant's conviction of five counts of criminal contempt in the first degree, defendant's separate conviction of five counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [2]) should be affirmed.  The People were not required to join the harassment charges with the contempt charges pursuant to CPL 40.40, since the harassment charges require proof of different elements than the criminal contempt charges.  Consequently, the two types of charges did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Moreover, although defendant raised the issue of multiplicity at trial, he failed to contend that the indictment was invalid due to the missing times of the phone calls or to contend that the indictment failed to give him notice of the cause of the accusation.  Thus, his present contention that the indictment was insufficient to give notice of the time of each phone call is unpreserved for appellate review.  Furthermore, since the five charges of aggravated harassment were each based on a separate phone call, regardless of their closeness in time, it was not improper for the District Attorney to charge defendant with five counts rather than one.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a nuisance abatement proceeding plaintiff City sought to prevent the reopening of defendant's adult establishment pursuant to the &quot;substantial portion&quot; language of New York, New York Zoning Resolution &sect; 12-10.

Under the 60-40 rule, a substantial portion of an adult eating or drinking establishment is devoted to adult use and the establishment must, therefore, conform to the Zoning Resolution when at least 40 percent of the floor and cellar areas accessible to customers are available for adult performance and viewing purposes.  Here, the club clearly remains an integrated adult enterprise of the type that was intended, under the Zoning Resolution, to be removed from residential City areas.  The front area requires a cover charge and there is no separate entrance or cover charge for the topless-dancing area.  Even without performers, the downstairs area cannot reasonably be seen as anything but a staging area used in the course of attracting customers to the upstairs performances.  There is still no conceivable reason why anyone uninterested in topless dancing would choose defendants' club over the many other nightclubs, bars and restaurants in the zoning district.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 2-126 was violated by expenditures made by appellant, Erie County Republican Committee, on behalf of its endorsed candidate for office of Erie County Executive before petitioner filed a designating petition seeking the Republican Party's nomination. On appeal, the court held that the statute was not violated because until petitioner filed a designating petition, which triggered the necessity for a primary election, the endorsed Republican candidate was not a person to be voted for at a primary election. Thus, expenditures made on his behalf by appellant prior to that time did not violate the statute. Further, the expenditures made by appellant before petitioner filed a designating petition were not made in aid of the nomination of the endorsed candidate against a primary.

Appellant contended that he was deprived of his right to be sentenced without unreasonable delay pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 380.30(1). Appellant was originally sentenced five years prior to the action. Yet, due to a federal parole violation, the sentencing judge ordered that he be released to federal custody for sentencing and that the sentences run concurrently. The order was not followed at that time. On appeal, the court held that where there was an extended delay, but plausible reasons are offered to explain it, the court must balance the factors involved before determining whether dismissal was warranted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Public Service Commission proposed a plan to promote competition in retail electric markets by allowing consumers to purchase electricity from private electric service companies. It planned to exempt such companies from the Home Energy Fair Practices Act, N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect;30 et seq., which afforded protections to customers in their relationship with utilities. Petitioners, utility project and others, claimed that the lightened regulation of private electric service companies was not authorized by statute and was illegal. They commenced a proceeding seeking to invalidate the plan, asserting they had standing under N.Y. Fin. State Law &sect;123-b and also common law. Respondent's motion to dismiss petitioners' claims was denied by the trial court. On cross appeals by both parties, the court reversed. Petitioners did not have standing under the finance law, which addressed expenditure of funds, not the extent of the regulatory authority in issue. Petitioners also lacked common law standing, as they failed to allege facts demonstrating that they would suffer direct harm different from that suffered by the public at large.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecution sought review of the decision of the Onondaga County Court (New York) which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the second count of the indictment charging defendant with first degree felony murder based on the allegation that he commanded the death of the victim or intended victim. Trial court held that term &quot;command,&quot; as found in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27(1)(a) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was incarcerated and awaiting trial, he allegedly directed a gang member to murder the complainant. A hit squad led by the gang member entered the complainant's home to kill him and instead they two children and an elderly woman in the head, execution style. Defendant was indicted for the crime of murder in the first degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27(1)(a)(vii). Pursuant to &sect; 125.27(1)(a)(vii), a person could not be convicted of first degree felony murder without committing the homicidal act unless that person &quot;commanded&quot; another person to cause the death of the victim or intended victim. The trial court dismissed the indictment on grounds the term &quot;commanded&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. Upon the state's appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court erred by not affording the term its commonly understood meaning in order to avoid a constitutional challenge. The court ruled that the trial court erred in analyzing the constitutionality of &sect; 125.27(1)(a)(vii) from a U.S. Const. amend. VIII perspective. Because this was not a death penalty case, defendant's vagueness argument should have been measured instead by due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's dismissal of the second count of the indictment on grounds term &quot;command&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, was reversed. The court concluded that as applied to this defendant, the limitation on accomplice liability was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the trial court erred by not affording the term its commonly understood meaning in order to avoid a constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - First Degree Felony Murder - Term &quot;Command&quot; Not Unconstitutionally Vague </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statutory limitation on Penal Law &sect; 20.00 accomplice liability for first degree felony murder and death penalty eligibility to only those accomplices who actually &quot;commanded&quot; the death of the victim or intended victim (Penal Law &sect; 125.27 [1] [a] [vii]) is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's noncapital felony murder prosecution for having allegedly directed a member of his street gang to murder complainant, which resulted in the execution-style shooting death of a woman in complainant's home.  County Court erred in refusing to afford the term &quot;command&quot; its plain meaning and determining that, in the absence of a statutory definition, the limitation on accomplice liability is unconstitutionally vague. Since the prosecutor failed to seek the death penalty (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 250.40), defendant's vagueness challenge should be measured by due process, not Eighth Amendment standards.  For due process purposes, Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii) is sufficiently definite to serve as the statutory definition of a crime.  A determination that the statute is sufficiently definite to serve as the basis for a criminal prosecution is not inconsistent with a determination that it is not sufficiently definite to serve as the basis for the imposition of the death penalty. Furthermore, County Court also erred by failing to accord the statute the strong presumption of constitutionality to which it is entitled and not construing the statute to preserve its constitutionality.  In the absence of a specific statutory definition, the term &quot;command&quot; should have been given its commonly understood meaning in order to avoid the constitutional challenge, especially since defendant's actions fall plainly within the ambit of the statute.  There was sufficient evidence before the Grand Jury to establish the existence of the gang, defendant's authoritative position within the gang and that defendant summoned a gang member to jail to make arrangements to &quot;take care&quot; of complainant's family to keep complainant from testifying.  Such evidence, if believed, establishes that defendant did not merely request, solicit or importune someone to kill complainant but acted as a boss-accomplice to order a member of his gang to commit the crime.  Accordingly, the first degree felony murder count of the indictment is reinstated and the matter is remitted to County Court for further proceedings.  </SPAN></P>
