</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the sentence imposed by a trial court (Pennsylvania) under the Mandatory Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9712(a) (1997), after he was convicted of robbery and possession of an instrument of crime. Defendant claimed that the &quot;weapon&quot; he used was a wooden plate holder and a hubcap nut remover fashioned to look like a gun and was not a replica of a firearm under the provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the item used for the threat did not constitute a replica of a firearm under the Act and that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the Act was properly applied. Whether defendant was or was not skilled in fashioning his simulated gun, he wanted his victim to think it was a real gun. The witnesses testified that the way defendant brandished the simulated weapon they believed that it was a firearm. Replica of a firearm was defined as an item that could reasonably have been perceived to be a firearm. The testimony established that defendant possessed a replica of a firearm and that the victim thought it was a gun. Therefore, the Act was properly applied. The constitutionality of the Act was never contested at trial or at sentencing. Because that issue was not raised during trial or sentencing it should be considered waived. Even in the event that the issue was properly preserved, the Act was constitutional. Although the use of the word &quot;item&quot; as used in the definition of replica of a firearm covered a broad spectrum of articles it provided sufficient limitation to those situations where there was a reasonable belief a real firearm was brandished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes. He filed a motion to preclude the introduction of victim impact testimony during the sentencing phase of his case under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9711 and to declare the section unconstitutional. The court granted the motion as to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9711(c)(2). The court found that the defendant had met the heavy burden of persuasion necessary to find a statute unconstitutional. The court found that the United States Supreme Court had found that victim impact testimony could be included in the sentencing phase, but the court found that this conclusion had to be combined with the Supreme Court's ruling that the discretion of the sentencing body had to be directed and limited. The court concluded that because the sentencing phase used a structure of aggravating and mitigating circumstances to reach the sentence, but under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9711(c)(2) the victim impact testimony was introduced without any guidance as to where it fit within the structure, it would result in unconstitutional subjectivity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised his claims under the U.S. Const. amends. I, III-VI, IX, XIV and provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Defendant asserted that the Act subjected him to punishment under a bill of attainder by declaring that all persons who had committed a predicate offense were &quot;sexually violent predators.&quot; The court held that the Act merely designated an offender with certain characteristics. It was up to the sentencing court to determine whether any particular offender possessed those characteristics. The court also held that the protections afforded under the Double Jeopardy Clause were not violated by the statute and that the registration and notification provisions of the Act did not violate defendant's right to privacy because a registrant had no constitutional protections from the state's disclosure of his criminal record. Also, the Act provided sufficient guidelines and was not void for vagueness. However, the procedures contained in &sect; 9794 of the Act violated defendant's right to due process under state and federal Constitutions because lengthy interviews by members of the board assessment violated defendant's right to be protected from self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for extraordinary relief challenging the constitutionality of the sexually violent predator provision of Pennsylvania's Megan's Law, 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and one count of corruption of minors. The involuntary deviate count was a predicate offense requiring registration under the Law. Defendant was sentenced to a five-year imprisonment term. The court held that the primary registration requirements under the Law were constitutional. However, the court determined that the provision that required mandatory enhanced sentencing for all offenders, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9794, unconstitutionally imposed punitive consequences without the requisite due process safeguards. Lastly, the court held that the provisions of the Law, which required a defendant to carry the burden of persuasion that he was not a sexual predator, was unconstitutional. The court determined that the Commonwealth was better equipped to prove its case against an offender than an offender was to prove its case against the Commonwealth. The court held that the sexually violent predator provisions of the Law were unconstitutional both as to enhanced sentencing and enhanced notification and registration. The court declined to apply the unconstitutional provisions to defendant's sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. The primary issue that defendant raised on appeal dealt with the constitutional aspects of the mandatory sentence as provided for in the &quot;Three Strikes&quot; legislation. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his Batson challenge to the Commonwealth's exclusion of African-Americans from the jury panel. On appeal, the court found that the prosecutor reasonably inferred that a juror would have been an unwilling juror and, therefore, properly exercised a peremptory challenge. Defendant next argued that the trial court erred in permitting certain physical evidence to go out with the jury for deliberation purposes. He contended that evidence was not properly marked, introduced, or admitted into evidence. The court found that the Commonwealth's exhibit was properly introduced and admitted into evidence. The court determined that the offense was grave and the penalty was not disproportionately harsh. A review of the record revealed no due process violation. Because the issue of defendant's liberty had already been decided upon his conviction, a fundamental liberty interest was not involved, and strict scrutiny was not required.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that, constitutionally, it was difficult to deny a foster home residential zoning where the foster home did not differ from other family homes in any substantial way. However, in the case at bar, the court affirmed and found that the foster home in question did not fit the zoning requirement because it was a medical foster home for young children whose care required medical providers and specialized equipment that would interfere with the residential nature of the area.</SPAN></P>

Defendant brought a motion to transfer proceedings to juvenile court and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to have the direct file legislation of the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa. Cons.

The court ruled that in the event that the evidence did not affirmatively demonstrate that the accused would likely benefit from the special features and programs of the juvenile court system, and when no special reason existed for sparing him from adult prosecution and punishment, jurisdiction necessarily remained within the criminal court system. Further, the court held that a legislative enactment enjoyed a presumption in favor of its constitutionality and was not declared unconstitutional unless it clearly, palpably, and plainly violated the constitution. The court denied both the motion to transfer proceedings to juvenile court and the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, concluding that the risk of failure in the juvenile system was too great, and that the Juvenile Act was not violative of defendant's constitutional due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer challenged the assessed value of an office building. The common pleas court first reduced the assessed value to $ 32 million. Then, on a further appeal, the taxpayer won a reduction in the assessed value to $ 25 million. Based on the latter amount, a refund was paid. However, when the Board held that the taxpayer was entitled to interest only from the date of the ruling setting the $ 25 million value, the taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed. On the taxpayer's further request for review, it again found that the taxpayer was entitled to interest only from the date of the lower assessment. In so holding, the court applied the rule that the Board was entitled to an order affirming its finding unless one of the three causes in 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 754(b) was found. Further, where, as here, a court had reduced a taxpayer's real estate tax assessment, the taxpayer was entitled to interest on tax overpayments only as of the date on which the assessment was reduced. In so ruling, it rejected a claim that the taxpayer was entitled to interest pursuant to Pa. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a complaint for child support, and an order of support was entered against the father pursuant to the parties' property settlement agreement. One year after the father's first motion to modify support was denied, the father filed another motion to modify support on the grounds that his daughter had graduated from high school and that his son had withdrawn from college. At that time, the trial court terminated the father's support obligation of his son and slightly increased the father's support obligation of his daughter. The father then filed another petition to vacate, which was denied by the court. Thereafter, the father filed his motion for reconsideration of the court's order denying his petition to vacate. After the court denied his motion for reconsideration, the father appealed. The court affirmed its decision, holding that even if the mother had waived her right to strictly enforce the parties' property settlement agreement, it was proper to compel the parties' compliance with the terms of their child support arrangement because such arrangement was in the best interests of the children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant unions sought review of an order entered by the court, which granted plaintiff city's motion for disposition on the merits and entered judgment for the city in an action to determine the rights of the parties after the enactment of Act No. 5, which purported to amend portions of the First Class City Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 13133(c), so as to make the provisions of the Heart and Lung Act, 53 P.S. &sect; 637, applicable to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Heart and Lung Act provided that injured police officers and fire fighters would receive full pay while on temporary work-related disability. Act No. 5 sought to make the Heart and Lung Act applicable to the city. The city claimed that Act No. 5 could not be retroactively applied to its existing collective bargaining agreements, which provided for 80 percent of pre-disability gross pay, whereas Act No. 5 was for payment of 100 percent of gross pay. The court held that the judgment for the city should stand. The purpose of Act No. 5 was to impose the provisions of the Heart and Lung Act upon cities of the first class. The intent was to keep the injured worker on the same financial plane as they were prior to the injury. That would infer that for the amount to be full, it had to be equivalent to that which the worker received in his pocket, after taxes, before the injury. Disability payments under the Heart and Lung Act were not taxable. To require the city to pay an injured worker 100 percent of his gross pay, where such pay was not subject to tax, would result in a windfall to the injured worker. That clearly was not the intent of the legislature when Act No. 5 was passed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the father owed the mother and daughter a certain sum for college expenses incurred during the daughter's junior and senior years along with one-half of her postgraduate expenses. The father responded with preliminary objections. The father alleged that the claims were barred by res judicata, that the daughter lacked standing to sue, and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court denied the objections. The claims were not barred by res judicata. A prior ruling on the father's support obligation was based on a different legal theory. The daughter was an interested party to the agreement because the amount in controversy consisted of her tuition and other educational expenses. The interest was immediate because the daughter was presently enrolled in college. Finally, the father's argument that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the postgraduate expenses were anticipatory lacked merit. The expenses also addressed college expenses from the past, which were not anticipatory. Also, an actual controversy existed because the daughter was in her last semester of college and considering graduate school.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment of the court denying the taxpayer's appeal from and affirming a ruling of appellee Tax Review Board (Pennsylvania). At issue was the period of time for which the taxpayer was entitled to be paid interest by appellee city on account of an overpayment of real estate taxes. The overpayment claim had been resolved by means of a settlement between the taxpayer, the Board, the city, and a school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Though the taxpayer paid the taxes, it challenged the valuation underlying the assessment. When the parties later settled the taxpayer's claim, the city refunded the overpayment. However, the city paid interest thereon only from the date of the settlement agreement. The taxpayer challenged the interest calculation, claiming that it was entitled to interest from the date of payment, not the date of settlement. The Board rejected the claim, and the court upheld the Board's ruling, both initially and on appeal. In so ruling, the court held that the Board properly applied the rule that where a court had reduced a taxpayer's tax assessment, the taxpayer was entitled to interest on tax overpayments effective only upon the date on which the assessment had been reduced. That was because the only issue was the amount of the refund, not the validity of the underlying tax. Because the validity of the underlying tax was not challenged by the taxpayer in the instant case, the taxpayer was only entitled to interest from the date of the settlement of the claim. Holding that the Board's ruling in that respect was correct, the court affirmed its earlier judgment sustaining the Board ruling.</SPAN></P>

The court held: (1) the term &quot;public interest&quot; as used in the transfer status in Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6322 and 6355 was not unconstitutionally vague because the legislature made it clear whenever possible, its provisions should control in matters pertaining to juveniles; (2) while the Act envisioned instances where its provisions would be inadequate and the more drastic remedies of the criminal court must be employed, it was clear that the preference was to treat the juvenile delinquent as a juvenile offender; and (3) a transfer back to juvenile court was in the &quot;public interest&quot; under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6322 when, considering all the criteria enumerated in 42 Pa. Cons.

The driver appealed, contending that the suspension violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and U.S. Const. amend. V. The court found persuasive the argument that the driver had a viable double jeopardy challenge because the remedial benefit from license suspension was not clear when the violation of the drug act bore no link to a motor vehicle. However, based on precedent upholding every constitutional challenge to every suspension imposed under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1532, the court was constrained to affirm the suspension.</SPAN></P>

The father filed a petition to modify support, alleging that the children's expenses and tuition expenses had increased. The mother filed a petition to reduce support. A master held a hearing. Between the time that the master heard the cause and the date she issued her proposed order, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declared Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 4327, which allowed for college support, unconstitutional. Accordingly, the master's recommendation did not include support for one daughter's college expenses. The court decided that the stipulation did not constitute a contract and therefore found that the mother could not be required to pay for college support. The father filed an appeal. The court affirmed its memorandum and order. The finding that the parties' stipulation did not create an independently enforceable contract was proper because the stipulation involved child support only and did not involve a comprehensive postnuptial or property settlement agreement. Thus, the stipulation did not rise to the level of agreements enforced as contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners of a parcel of land that had a gas station on it leased the property to an oil company. When the lessors were forced to pay the clean up costs arising from a storage tank leak, they claimed that the lessee oil company was liable for the clean-up costs pursuant to a term of the lease. The lessors also brought a private action under the Act. The lessors filed for summary judgment, and the court denied it part and granted it in part. The court held that the lease's terms regarding clean-up liability were ambiguous and would have to be determined at a hearing by parol evidence. However, the trust agreement under which one-half of the land was owned failed to give the alleged trustees the power to bring the action, and so the cause of action as to them was dismissed. The court held that under the Act, a private cause of action to compel compliance and to seek damages did exist, but not if, as in the present case, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Regulation (DER) had already initiated enforcement proceedings because the purpose of the Act was being adequately served by the DER.</SPAN></P>

The subcontractor filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the action was barred by the Pennsylvania statute of repose, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5536.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subcontractor contended that the owners' claim was barred by &sect; 5536 because it was filed more than 12 years after completion of the construction of the property. The owners contended that &sect; 5536(a)(4) was inapplicable to their indemnification claim and that they were not barred from proceeding under a general breach of contract theory. The court disagreed and held that: 1) the statute of repose was applicable to the owners' claims because the work done by the subcontractor constituted improvement of the real estate where it added value to the property and was performed to enhance its utility; 2) the Pennsylvania statute of repose encompassed both tort and contract actions; 3) the statute of repose applied to the owners' contract claims because the damage alleged stemmed from injury to the property itself; and 4) even if the indemnification action was not barred, it would not apply to the owners' defective product argument because there was no assertion that the subcontractor knew or had reason to know that the paint contained asbestos, as required by the indemnification clause.</SPAN></P>

The wife stated she would be better off dead. Defendant retrieved a loaded pistol from his nightstand and handed it to his wife, who shot herself and died. Defendant claimed that the charging statute was unconstitutional, arguing that the law of Pennsylvania recognized an all-encompassing right to die. The court rejected this claim, holding that the recognized right to die did not render unconstitutional the provision of Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2505(b) that prohibited causing or aiding suicide. The court also rejected the claim that &sect; 2505(b) was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that defendant caused a suicide or an attempted suicide if it was shown beyond a reasonable doubt that &quot;but for&quot; defendant's conduct, the suicide or attempted suicide would not have occurred. Further, the court held that there was sufficient evidence at the preliminary hearing because, at this stage, the Commonwealth only had to prove the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court refused to suppress defendant's statements made to the police because he was read Miranda warnings and signed a waiver of rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of several criminal offenses involving sexual activity with a 12-year-old victim. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by refusing to allow evidence of the victim's prior homosexual activity and by admitting photographs of the victim. Defendant also argued that his statement should have been suppressed. Finally, defendant argued that the court erroneously failed to inform the jury that he would be sentenced to a mandatory jail term if convicted and that sentences for involuntary sexual deviate intercourse and indecent assault should have merged. The court rejected defendant's arguments. The court noted that defendant's evidence of the victim's prior homosexual activity was barred by 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3104(a) and (b). The photographs of the victim were correctly admitted, as they were not inflammatory. The court, then, found that the refusal to tell the jury about the sentencing ramifications of a conviction was correct, as punishment was the sole province of the court. Also, the occurrence of the indecent assault offenses prior to the involuntary deviate sexual intercourse convictions did not merge for sentencing purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth filed a motion to vacate defendant's sentence upon a conviction for two violations of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, one count of criminal conspiracy, and one count of violating the Uniform Firearms Act. The mandatory minimum sentence under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7508 was not imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Previously, defendant entered into a plea bargain with the Commonwealth whereby he would plead guilty to the charges in exchange for the Commonwealth not pursuing the mandatory minimum sentence. Defendant later withdrew his plea and went to trial. Immediately following a jury's verdict of guilty, the Commonwealth announced its intention to seek the mandatory minimum sentence. After a hearing upon post-verdict motions, the court refused to impose the mandatory minimum sentence. The Commonwealth's motion to vacate the sentence was denied. In so ruling, the court stated that the district attorney's office unconstitutionally infringed upon defendant's right to due process by vindictively seeking imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence to punish defendant's exercise of his right to a jury trial. Even if 18 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 7508 granted the prosecutor the unfettered discretion to invoke the terms of mandatory sentencing provisions, the court stated that the district attorney abused the discretion. The district attorney admitted that it was the policy of his office to always seek mandatory minimums when there had been a trial.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the Commonwealth did not meet its burden to prove compliance with 67 Pa. Code &sect; 77.24(d). Defendant's motion was denied.

The court conducted an independent review and determined that the evidence could not establish that defendant had caused the death of his father, thus, dismissal with prejudice was proper. As to defendant's request to expunge his arrest record, the court noted that the Commonwealth could not prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; therefore, defendant was innocent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business requested a permanent injunction to enjoin defendants, a city, a mayor, and members of the city council, from enforcing Erie, Pa., Ordinance 75-1994 (1994). The court had temporarily enjoined defendants from enforcing the ordinance until it rendered its decision, but it later denied the business's motion for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business provided adult entertainment to its patrons in the form of nude dancing. The business contended that Ordinance 75-1994, which made nude dancing or the promotion of such illegal, was unconstitutional. The court agreed and entered an injunction to enjoin its enforcement. The court found that Ordinance 75-1994, as drafted, violated Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. amend. I in that it was overbroad as it prohibited all nudity, whether or not said nudity was related to adult entertainment. The ordinance was impermissibly applicable to other types of protected speech, which contained nudity, such as theatrical performances. It was of no consequence that defendants agreed not to enforce the ordinance against theatrical groups because there was no guarantee future administrations would do the same. Also, the provision prohibiting nudity was so interwoven with the entire ordinance that it was not severable because to remove the provision would negate the legislative intent in enacting the ordinance, that being to restrict businesses, which provided adult entertainment. Thus, the entire ordinance was invalid for overbroadness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued the permanent injunction in favor of the business.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs contended that the application of &sect; 7114 violated the Equal Protection Clauses of both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions by allegedly creating different rights for mentally ill patients as compared to non-mentally ill patients. The court affirmed its prior order, concluding that &sect; 7114 did not violate any constitutional provisions and was enacted with the state legislature's intention of furthering the legitimate governmental objective of assuring the availability of adequate treatment to mentally ill patients. The court noted that the limited liability afforded by &sect; 7114, by requiring plaintiffs to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the providers committed gross negligence, was a legitimate means to assure that adequate treatment was provided to all mentally ill patients as required by Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 75 Pa. Const.

It also issued a five-year revocation under 75 Pa. Const. &sect; 1542(d), for the licensee's having been found to be a habitual offender. The Department also issued 27 consecutive two-year revocations pursuant 75 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 1542(e), for the additional offenses that he committed within a five-year period. Some convictions were for receiving stolen property. The court ruled that the licensee was denied substantive Due Process as a result of the revocations. The court held that although the State had an interest in regulating the use of its highways, the purpose of the Habitual Offender's Statute,&nbsp;75 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 1542, was not served by denying the licensee the right to drive for 61 years. The court held that the Statute was meant to punish persons who repeatedly violated motor vehicle laws. The court concluded that the license revocation was so intrusive into the licensee's private affairs that it was not justifiable by the State's interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant drive past a stop sign and upon pulling him over, administered three field sobriety tests which defendant failed. The court found that due to the fact that defendant failed to stop prior to entering the intersection, the officer had probable cause to pull him over and detain him. The court determined that the charges in the information were clear and explicit, and properly put defendant on notice as to what he must specifically defend against. The court ruled that not only had the legislature gone beyond its limits in enacting 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(5), but it had enacted a law which did not accomplish the intended purpose, was not a valid exercise of the police power, affected different people in a randomly unfair manner, eliminated a standard by which criminal conduct could be measured, and failed to give notice to the public of the conduct proscribed. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss count II because the statute upon which it was based was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and a deprivation of due process. The court held that the Commonwealth was precluded from amending the information at this stage.</SPAN></P>

For ten years prior to the diagnosis of a brain tumor, she was treated by the two internists and a psychiatrist. In 1989, she filed an action against all three doctors, claiming that they failed to timely diagnose her brain tumor, and as a result of the delay in surgery, she went blind. The neurosurgeon told plaintiff's daughter that plaintiff's psychiatric problems were from the tumor, but the daughter did not tell plaintiff this news because of her mother's condition and the high level of medication she was under. In 1988, the daughter told plaintiff that her doctors had erred in not attributing her symptoms to organic causes. Plaintiff filed her action in 1989, more than two years from the diagnosis of a brain tumor but less than two years from the time plaintiff was told by her daughter that her tumor might have been diagnosed earlier. The court denied the doctors' motion for summary judgment, finding that it was for a jury to determine whether a reasonable person would have known that there was malpractice in the late diagnosis of the brain tumor.</SPAN></P>

Arguments were made on behalf of both the Republican and the Democratic candidates followed by a decision that watchers for each district and for each candidate would be instructed as to the proper challenge procedure used for any allegedly improperly cast absentee ballots. Thereafter, challenges were made to several absentee ballots for which no evidence in support thereof was presented. Subsequently, no appeal was filed or stay obtained in relation to the ballots and they were included in the vote count.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case came by way of post-trial motions filed by defendant corporations following plaintiff victim's successful tort action. Defendants contended that certain evidence ought to have been admitted at trial, that plaintiff's expert was wrongly permitted to testify regarding certain matters, that the verdict was excessive and based on insufficient evidence, and that defendants were wrongfully denied the right to reopen their case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff victim filed a tort action against defendant corporations stemming from an injury he received. The court denied defendants' motion for post-trial relief, finding that a surveillance tape presented by defendants was properly excluded from evidence because its presentation would have resulted in prejudice and surprise to plaintiff. Similarly, the court found that the testimony of plaintiff's expert witness was properly admitted into evidence because plaintiffs had access to his notes and, therefore, they were able to prepare a defense against his testimony under Pa. R. Civ. P. 4003.5. The court determined that the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence and held that the verdict was not excessive because it did not shock the conscience of the court. Although defendants sought to reopen the case, the court found that they were properly denied this right because their request to reopen was neither in the interest of a more accurate adjudication nor because of their inadvertence to admit evidence. The court found no evidence suggesting that Philadelphia Local Rule 212 was unconstitutional or that jury instructions were inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendants' motion for post-trial relief, finding that a surveillance tape presented by defendants corporation was properly excluded from evidence and that plaintiff's expert witness was properly allowed to testify because defendants had access to his notes. The court also held that the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence and did not shock the court and that defendants were properly denied the right to reopen the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a bargaining agent for a police department, filed an application to obtain a review of an arbitration award entered by an arbitration panel that was appointed pursuant to the Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, No. 111, para. 1 et seq; Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 43, &sect; 217.1 et seq (Act 111). The agent sought an order vacating the award, vacating an interim award, directing the parties to convene a new panel, and staying and enjoining the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agent and respondent city were parties to a collective bargaining agreement that governed wages, hours, and conditions of the city's police officers represented by the agent. Prior to the termination of their existing agreement, the parties exchanged proposals for changes in the agreement. They were unable to agree on most issues. Because the parties had reached an impasse and stalemate in the collective bargaining process and because police officers were deprived of the right to strike, a request was made for the appointment of the panel. The panel issued an interim award and a final award. The agent contended in part that the awards were contrary to law, unjust, inequitable, unconscionable, and in excess of the power of the arbitrators. Denying the application with one exception, the court held (1) that there were no improper contacts between any of the parties and the neutral arbitrator; and (2) that with the exception of the disability provisions contained in an appendix, which violated Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 54, &sect; 637, the final award was not illegal and compelled no illegal conduct. Although the city prevailed on most issues, fairness was not the proof of unconscionability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With the exception of a temporary disability clause, the court denied the agent's petition.</SPAN></P>

The court held that to allow a procedural rule to defeat the rights of the child was not in her best interest. The court found that the new statute, by retroactively depriving the father of the benefits of the prior judgment to bar the mother's new claim through res judicata, did not violate the ex post facto prohibition and deprive him of his right to rely on the prior judgment. The court held that the decision rendered the prior statute of limitations for paternity actions wholly void. If was as if it were never enacted. The court held that the prior statute of limitations was void ab initio and the judgment rendered pursuant to the statute had no effect. The court further held that the public policy of promoting the best interests of the child prevailed over procedural rules. The court denied the father's post-trial motions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police found two stolen cars on the street more than 200 feet away from a garage. Defendants were in the driveway of the garage with two other vehicles that were not stolen. The garage had an overhead door, which was closed, and a personal door, which was open. While one officer talked to defendants about permission to look around, the other officer went into the garage through the open door and wrote down vehicle identification numbers of stolen cars. The officers then called for a search warrant and seized the cars. The court held that the officers did not have the requisite probable cause, or even a suspicion reasonable enough to support their entry, into the garage. The officers' search of the garage was not reasonable and was violative of the Fourth Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Accordingly, all of the evidence subsequently seized pursuant to the search was suppressed. Additionally, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6308(c), which allowed warrantless administrative searches of commercial garages, was unconstitutional on its face as a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment and Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs submitted a subdivision plan, which the township rejected. Later, the court of common pleas held that the plan was deemed approved. Defendants filed an equity action, which they won. Plaintiffs brought suit and alleged that the equity action was arbitrary, vexatious, and in bad faith. The court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. Defendants had a right to take legal action on the advice of the township solicitor and were entitled to the defense of official immunity. There was no evidence of misuse of process and willful misconduct. The course of litigation between the parties did not establish purposeful discrimination in violation of &sect; 1983. There was nothing in the record averring facts that could have established that defendants' actions constituted unconstitutional discrimination. All of the litigation arose over interpretations of the facts and the law. Finally, the cause of action as to the township was barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs did not give the township notice of the suit within six months of the date that the township filed the equity action, which was necessary. The action against the commissioners was also time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent became involved in a dispute with his employee, who called the police and reported that the decedent had a gun.

In the wife's negligence suit, the jury found in her favor. When asked to reconsider its denial of the city's motion for post-trial relief, the court stood by its order. The court held that Philadelphia, Pa., Code ch. 21-700 waived the city's immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903(a)(1). Defendant filed a motion in arrest of judgment on the grounds of the de minimus nature of his conduct. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 5903(a)(1), asserting that it was vague and confusing, and hence resulted in a denial of due process under both the Pennsylvania and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was selling videotapes at a flea market. The tapes were sexually orientated. They were placed on end so that only one edge was visible, however the edges depicted pictures of nude female torsos. Minors walking by defendant's booth could see these depictions. Defendant claimed that there was no evidence that the tapes were viewed by minors, that he had not engaged in any criminal conduct deliberately, and that the police had not warned him or given him an opportunity to cease the illegal activity. The court rejected defendant's motion in arrest of judgment on the grounds of the de minimus nature of his conduct. The court also determined that the information was not defective. It was not necessary for the Commonwealth to become embroiled in definitions of obscene materials in a prosecution under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5903(a). Thus, any failure to include the requirement relating to knowledge of the obscene nature of the material as propounded by defendant constituted harmless error. As such, it was insufficient grounds for an arrest of judgment. In addition, the court held that the Pennsylvania courts had previously determined that &sect; 5903 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a prior ruling of the court (Pennsylvania), which bound his case over for trial following a preliminary hearing. Defendant was charged with driving under the influence to a degree which renders a person incapable of safe driving, in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(1), and driving while the amount of alcohol by weight in the blood is 0.10 percent or greater, in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in finding that the Commonwealth established a prima facie case against him and that the charges should have been dismissed. The court granted defendant's request and dismissed the charges against him. In so holding, the court found that: (1) the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of establishing at least prima facie that defendant drove, operated, or was in actual physical control of the movement of the vehicle in which he was found; (2) defendant was asleep when a police officer approached him, and his feet were on the driver's side of the seat; (3) the vehicle in which defendant was located did not have the engine running nor were the lights on; and (4) to have required, as the Commonwealth contended, defendant's keys to have been removed from the ignition and thrown from the car would have been the height of legal casuistry and flown in the face of common sense.</SPAN></P>

The claimant filed a motion for delay damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the claimant was injured when the pole fell on him, he filed a suit against the city for damages. When a jury awarded damages to the claimant, the city filed a motion for a new trial. The claimant filed a motion for delay damages. The court denied the city's motion and added the delay damages to the jury's award. The claimant testified that the bases of all the poles were rusted and two were leaning, one of which struck the claimant. A pole had previously fallen, and weeks later another fell. The pole that fell on the claimant did so because it had rusted through in the same area, above the base, as had other poles on the playground. The pole had split at the rusted base. The city had notice of the condition of the poles, but did nothing. The condition of the poles both before and after the accident was probative to the issues of foreseeability and notice. There was clearly a common causation element. In addition, there was evidence that city workers had played basketball there before the accident. The evidence was more than adequate to permit the jury to find that the city had constructive, if not actual, notice as indicated by a work order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from his arrest for violating a curfew ordinance, specifically Reading City, Pa., Ordinance art. 725.01. In seeking a new trial, defendant asserted that his arrest was unlawful for lack of probable cause. The court disagreed and also concluded that the search of defendant at the police station was incident to a lawful arrest. The court noted that Reading City, Pa., Ordinance art. 725.05 specifically granted police the authority to arrest for a curfew violation, with or without a warrant. However, the court determined that the warrantless search of defendant's leather bag was invalid because defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag and no exigency occurred at the police station that justified the warrantless search of the leather bag. The court observed that the bag was discovered when defendant was stripped searched, which was more than an hour after he was arrested. The bag was immediately removed from defendant and placed in a separate room. The officers involved in the search were not concerned about the possibility of defendant being dangerous, or the possibility that the bag contained weapons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injury victims sought damages from the manufacturers for injuries sustained from occupational exposure to the manufacturers' asbestos containing products. The jury entered a verdict against the manufacturers. The injury victims sought delay damages and the manufacturers filed motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On appeal, the court denied the manufacturers' motion for a new trial because the statement by the injury victims' counsel was not inflammatory and was not prejudicial. Further, the jury verdict did not indicate an inflamed jury. The court rejected the manufacturers' request for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and held that there was sufficient evidence of asbestos related conditions and increased risk and fear of lung cancer. From the evidence, the jury was able to reasonably determine the degree to which future consequences of present injury were probable. The court granted the injury victims' motion for an award of delay damages. Because the manufacturers' offer was not in writing, it did not relieve the manufacturers from their obligation for delay damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condemnor contended that the condemnee was not entitled to delay compensation because it retained physical possession of the property and continued to use it for storage. In awarding interest to the condemnee at simple interest, prime plus one percent, from March 24, 1972, the court found that the condemnee was entitled to delay compensation. Although the condemnee continued to use the property for storage after condemnation, it was deprived of the full and normal use of its property. The condemnee did not have the required possession within the meaning of &sect; 611 of the Eminent Domain Code so as to bar it from receiving delay compensation. Since the condemnee was entitled to delay compensation, a set-off for rent could not be given to the condemnor. A condemnor could receive rent if delayed compensation was not owed. Delay compensation was to be calculated from March 24, 1972, the date on which estimated just compensation was paid into court. Until the condemnor paid estimated just compensation, it could not have taken possession of the property. Additionally, delay compensation was to be paid at a commercial loan rate of prime plus one percent. It was not to be compounded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At an administrative law hearing, a license holder admitted that a large number of minors attended a teen night, that the minors circulated freely between two establishments via a stairway and fire door, that no adults other than employees supervised the minors, and that unlocked cabinets and coolers containing alcohol were present at both locations. The court agreed with the Liquor Control Board that permitting such a large group of minors to gather without providing proper supervision and without properly locking up the alcoholic beverages constituted a statutory violation. The court pointed out that the license holder not only acquiesced to the presence of the minors, but invited them and then failed to institute the statutory safeguards for supervising the underage guests. The court concluded that where the number of minors was small and/or they were not invited onto the premises, it would clearly be inappropriate to find that a single visit supported a charge of permitting frequenting, but where the number of minors was large, and they were invited onto the premises, it was inappropriate to deny that the license holder permitted minors to frequent the establishments.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a petition to suppress the evidence that was gathered against him at the sobriety checkpoint.

When the congestion would diminish, the officer would again institute a stop and examination of the operators. The officer agreed that he had waived cars through when the traffic became congested. The court denied defendant's petition. The court found that defendant's interpretation of the procedure was misunderstood in that all vehicles were in fact stopped as they approached the checkpoint. The fact that many of them were then waived through when congestion occurred did not render the system flawed. Waiving vehicles through to diminish congestion was permissible. The court found that the system was systematically implemented. The court concluded that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, defendant entered a negotiated guilty plea and was sentenced to the term of four to 23 months.

Defendant then filed a successful pro se petition for early parole. In the third case, defendant pleaded guilty before the court and sentenced to a prison term. Defendant was subsequently granted a good time parole. In the last case, defendant was convicted and sentenced to not more than 23 months. Defendant was granted a good time parole. In each of the case, the Commonwealth claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant parole because the sentence upon which the court granted parole was one which had by operation of law been aggregated with other sentences so as to place it under the state parole board's jurisdiction. The court had jurisdiction to grant parole because the lumping requirement did not relate to sentences of less than two year which were to be served in the county prison where the court had not indicated specifically on the record that the sentences should be so aggregated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver brought a demurrer to plaintiff fiancee's complaint. The complaint sought to recover damages for extreme emotional distress because the fiancee saw his fiancee killed by the driver who was intoxicated and operating his motor vehicle at a dangerous and reckless rate of speed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reasoned that a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer could only have been sustained in cases that clearly and without a doubt failed to state a claim for which relief could have been granted. The pleadings did not clearly and without a doubt establish that the fiancee was not located near the scene of the accident. A factor/element of the tort was whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon the fiancee from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident. The court held that the pleading was sufficient as to this element. The third element was whether the fiancee and the victim were closely related. The parties agreed that this was a case of first impression because the fiancee and the victim were not married. The only contact averred was an engagement that could have been broken by either party at any time without any sanction directly related to the contract of a mere engagement. The court concluded that granting marital tort rights to the fiancee of a victim would constitute an unnecessary as well as an undesirable expansion of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the demurrer. The court dismissed the fiancee's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mandatory sentencing statute made the minimum sentence of five years the same period of confinement as the drug statute's maximum sentence. The court determined that the statute was in total derogation of Pennsylvania's sentencing scheme. A sentence of confinement where the minimum exceeded one-half the maximum had long been held to be illegal. The court also decided that the mandatory sentencing statute failed to guard against the capricious and frightening prospect that a sentencing judge might decide the maximum sentence was or should be outrageously high. The statute was void for vagueness and denied defendant due process of law. The court concluded that the provision of the statute that required the imposition of a fine was neither inapplicable nor violative of due process because the legislature provided the court with an explicit and definite monetary amount of the fine to be assessed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant administrator was substituted as defendant. After the court entered judgment for plaintiffs, plaintiffs filed a motion for delay damages; the court granted the motion and denied defendant's subsequent motion for reconsideration. The court wrote an opinion in support of the orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiffs' action was filed, defendant driver's insurer made a settlement offer of $ 46,000 plus plaintiffs' out-of-pocket expenses. Defendant driver died during the pendency of the action. On the eve of trial, the administrator was appointed and substituted as defendant. Plaintiffs sought delay damages under Pa. R. Civ. P. 238. In response to plaintiffs' motion for delay damages, the administrator alleged, among other things, that delay damages should not have been awarded against him and that delay damages, if imposed at all, should not have been imposed for the period of time after which the insurer had offered $ 46,000. The court held that delay damages were properly assessed against the administrator because the administrator was responsible for defendant driver's legal liabilities, under Pa. R. Civ. P. 2354. The provision in Pa. R. Civ. P. 238(b)(1) that ended delay damage interest on the date of a written offer of settlement for a &quot;specified sum&quot; that amounted to at least 80 percent of the eventual recovery applied only to an offer of a specific monetary amount. The insurer's offer of $ 46,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses was not a specific sum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15202, created the Authority and authorized it to develop, finance, construct, maintain, operate, and lease convention centers, either by itself or in conjunction with others. The Authority derived revenue from a hotel room rental tax and financial support from the Commonwealth and the city where a project was to be built. Plaintiffs sued the city to prevent it from entering into a lease and service agreement with the Authority. The court held: (1) where &sect; 16214(b) of the Act provided that the city's obligation to pay a grant to the Authority was not a debt within the meaning of any constitutional provision, and was only payable to the extent current revenues were available, the grant was not a debt that violated Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect; XII; (2) &sect; 16214(b) empowered the city to make grants from current revenues to the Authority and to assist in defraying the cost; (3) &sect; 16214(b)(10) allowed the Authority to issue bonds to finance the project, and although the city was also permitted to do so, it was not required; and (3) plaintiffs' challenge to the ordinance adopting the agreement was untimely.</SPAN></P>

The litigants also alleged that the individual actively practiced law without a license in violation of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2254. The litigants asked for fees and costs incurred in the defense of that action. The litigants also requested damages in a related federal action. The litigants asked the court to impose a civil penalty on the individual for the wrongful use of civil proceedings, as authorized by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6355. Rule 11 was almost identical to 42 Pa Cons. Stat. &sect; 8355. The individual was a pro se plaintiff. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, pro se litigants were not immune from Rule 11 sanctions. A movant had a greater burden in bringing a Rule 11 motion against a non-lawyer, but liability could be held against pro se plaintiffs. Rule 11 sanctions could be imposed in cases that were clearly harassment and where the litigant should surely have known that the complaint had no hope whatsoever of success.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that a school tax in excess of 25 mills could not have included employee and fringe benefits since fringe benefits were not &quot;salary or increments&quot; as provided for in &sect; 6-672. In addition, the taxpayer argued that the tax rate at issue was illegal and, as such, that the taxes could not have been collected. On the other hand, the district argued that fringe benefits were a part of the salary exception to the 25-mill limitation. In the alternative, the district argued that if the fringe benefits were a part of salary, then &sect; 6-672 was unconstitutional. On consideration of the issues, the court first held that the statute was clear. As a result, after looking at the provisions of the statute, the court determined that the term &quot;salary&quot; did not include the many benefits provided in addition to salary. Secondly, the court stated that it did not consider &sect; 6-672 to have been in violation of the Pennsylvania Constitution.

The Pennsylvania legislature repealed the six-year statute of limitations period and extended it to 18 years. On appeal, the supreme court held that the six-year limitations period applied. The Pennsylvania legislature then amended 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4343(b) to provide for unlimited retroactive application of the new 18-year statute of limitations. The mother commenced suit and sought a paternity test and an order of support. The father claimed res adjudicata and filed a motion to dismiss. The paternity tests were stayed pending the motion. The court denied the motion and lifted the stay. The court held that Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4343(b)(2) applied to the case. The court opined that Pa. Cons.

The trial court sustained the Commonwealth's demurrer regarding defendant's assertion that indigent members of the community were underrepresented in the county's jury selection. The court also determined that pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The co-beneficiary made her claim under a will, which the register refused to probate. Section 2502(2) established the appropriate procedures when wills were signed by mark and required that the name of the marking testator be subscribed before or after he made his mark in his presence. The co-beneficiary contended that the legislative authority was exceeded in the strict language of &sect; 2502(2) and was such an arbitrary exercise of legislative power as to have violated the due process guarantee of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The court held that &sect; 2502(2) was not unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 2502(2) represented the appropriate legislative discretion in mandating safeguards to carry out the intention of the testator and eliminate fraud when wills were signed by mark.</SPAN></P>

The workers brought actions in two cases against the manufacturer and other defendants. The jury returned verdicts in favor of the workers.

The court denied the manufacturer's post-trial motions and granted the workers' motions for delay damages. The jury's reduction to seven people was commonplace. The court ruled that it properly charged that the workers had one day in court to prove their compensable injuries. The jury was adequately instructed on proximate cause. The court ruled that the manufacturer's motion for remittitur was denied because the jury's verdict exhibited no unfairness, mistake, partiality, or prejudice, nor did it shock the court's conscience. The manufacturer's rights were protected because it could bring a future contribution action against any defendant who emerged from bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, defendant filed post-sentence motions for modification of sentence and applied for bail pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 4010B(2). In upholding the sentence, the court held that when &sect; 3735 of the Vehicle Code was enacted, the legislature was aware of case law that one criminal act beget one sentence, irrespective of the number of victims. The court held that for this reason, the legislature made &sect; 3735 a mandatory sentence and clearly addressed &quot;death of another person&quot; and made no distinction as to the number of victims in the one incident. The court held that under &sect; 3735, the act rather than the victims merged. As such, the court held that the imposition of a three-year minimum sentence on each victim was not only proper but mandatory.

Defendants moved for a new trial on the grounds that the trial court erred, inter alia, in denying their motion for a continuance. Plaintiffs moved for a new trial on the grounds that the trial court erred in refusing to apply the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 73, &sect; 201-1 et seq. The court denied both parties' motion for a new trial. There was no abuse of discretion in denying defendant's motion for a continuance because it was uncertain that a continuance would have insured one defendant's presence at trial when defendant was in another country. The court found that the expert called by plaintiffs, who was a doctor specializing in dermatology, was properly allowed to testify as to defendants' negligent application of electrolysis because the expert had a reasonable pretension to specialized knowledge of the field. The court found that the Unfair Trade Practices Act was not applicable because statements made by defendants did not fall within any of the prohibited acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent executed a will that left one-third to his first wife, one-third to his stepfather, and one-third to his aunt. The decedent was divorced from his first wife. After only being married to his second wife for two months, the decedent died leaving no issue or parents. The decedent did not make a new will after his divorce. Pursuant to 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2203, the second wife filed an election against the will. The executor, in making his accounting, followed 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2507(3), which provided that if a testator died after making a will, the surviving spouse received a share as if the decedent died intestate. The court dismissed the objections, finding that &sect; 2507(3) was not unconstitutional under the 5th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution. The beneficiary did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to the decedent's estate, but only had an expectation. Thus, the beneficiary did not have a property interest in her share of decedent's estate. The court found that &sect; 2507(3) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it was rationally related to the protection of surviving spouses not provided for in a decedent's will.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint on the ground that a &quot;wrongful birth&quot; cause of action was barred in Pennsylvania by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8305. On appeal of the dismissal, plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred when it held that &sect; 8305 was applicable to all of plaintiffs' several causes of action and that &sect; 8305 was unconstitutional. The court ruled that &sect; 8305 did not prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion but simply prevented her from filing suit claiming that but for the act or omission of a physician, a person once conceived would not or should not have been born. The court held that &sect; 8305 did not operate to the disadvantage of a suspect class or impinge upon a fundamental right.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate sued the asbestos companies for injuries arising from the decedent's exposure to the asbestos products. The asbestos companies contended that the action was time-barred because the decedent knew or should have known of his asbestosis when he filed a disability claim for a severe lung condition due to exposure to silica and asbestos. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the estate. The court denied the asbestos companies' motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial and granted the estate's motion for delay damages. First, the court held that whether or not the decedent used due diligence in attempting to discover that he had asbestosis was a jury question. Filing the workers' compensation claim form was not a conclusive presumption of knowledge of its contents. There was evidence to support the jury's findings of due diligence. There also was evidence to support the jury's finding that the absence of warnings by the asbestos companies caused the decedent's injuries. Finally, the court held that the estate was entitled to delay damages, to be paid by the asbestos companies only on the shares of the verdict on which each was found liable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was fined $ 75 under the Motor Vehicle Code, $ 10 under the Emergency Medical statute, court costs, and $ 150 under the Catastrophic Loss Benefits Continuation Fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the Catastrophic Loss Benefits Continuation Fund surcharge imposed after his summary conviction. He contended that &sect; 4 of Act No. 1989-24 (Pennsylvania) was unconstitutional because it amounted to an excessive fine and that the law was improperly enacted. The court rejected the arguments and upheld the statute. The court ruled that the surcharge was related to the use of an overweight vehicle, and it applied without exception, irrespective of the overweight amount. Treating the surcharge as an additional monetary penalty was not in violation of the Pennsylvania Constitution in that it was not excessive when considered in regard to the interest of the Commonwealth in making whole those injured on its highways. The history of the act did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 because the primary purpose of the bill was intact throughout its history, was not altered by either body of the legislature without the other having knowledge of the amendment, and ultimately both bodies concurred in the amendments.</SPAN></P>

Upon defendant's appeal, the court filed a supplemental opinion in support of a sentence imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to his second offense of driving under the influence of alcohol. Defendant unsuccessfully sought the court's consideration of a sentence to an inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program. Pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(e), the court sentenced defendant to serve not less than 30 days in a county prison, pay a $ 450 fine, and pay a $ 100 CAT fund fine. Defendant was released and continued on bail on his own recognizance pending a final determination of his appeal of his sentence. In support of the sentence imposed upon defendant, the court opined that, as a second-time offender, defendant had to necessarily serve the mandatory minimum sentence in prison pursuant to &sect; 3731(e). As time served in an inpatient alcohol treatment program did not constitute service of a statutorily mandated minimum sentence of imprisonment, the court was required to sentence defendant to 30 days in prison and not to an inpatient alcohol program. Given the legitimate concerns of the legislature in preventing and punishing drunk driving, the mandatory sentencing provisions of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731 were not arbitrary and constitutionally authorized the $ 100 CAT fund fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grand jury concluded that an investigation of the township's finances was warranted. A special auditor prepared a financial report, which directed the auditor to assess surcharges for financial discrepancies where appropriate. Pursuant thereto the auditor assessed surcharges against movants, who were not officials, officers, or employees of the township, or persons who had control over its funds. Movants sought to strike the surcharge, contending that under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 56001 such a surcharge could be assessed only against a person who had power or control over township funds. The court struck the surcharge, finding that the surcharge could only be assessed against municipal officers, officials, employees, or other persons who had access to or control over funds in the township's treasury. The contention of the special auditor that he had authority to assess the surcharge against any person irrespective of their relationship to the township was erroneous, as such an interpretation would give the power to assess the surcharge as a substitute for initiating a civil lawsuit against persons who were not officers or agents of the township and in control of its funds.</SPAN></P>

The putative daughter also filed a petition under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6133, part of the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity, seeking blood samples to establish paternity. At issue was whether the petition for blood samples was time-barred under 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4343(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intestate passed away. The putative daughter petitioned under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6133 to obtain blood samples held by the county in order to test them to establish whether the intestate was her father. Section 6133 permitted courts to order blood testing to establish paternity. The estate argued that the blood sample petition was time-barred under 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4343(b), an 18-year statute of limitations. The court granted the putative daughter's petition for blood samples. 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4343 was in a chapter entitled &quot;Support Matters Generally.&quot; Therefore, it was evident that &sect; 4343 was meant to protect putative fathers from support actions after a certain time and not meant as a defense against probate claims. In cases seeking relief other than support, Pennsylvania did put a time limit on paternity determinations. Further, 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3538 expressly provided that children born out of wedlock and children born in wedlock were subject to the same time limits. As a result, the putative daughter had the right under 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2107(3) (1982), part of the intestacy statute, to try to prove paternity with clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

The allegations sounded in assumpsit, but the essence of the claims actually disputed the telephone company's rates. The PUC specifically had exclusive jurisdiction and the service provider was required to first exhaust its administrative remedies under the Public Utilities Law, 66 P.S. &sect; 1101 et seq., before seeking a judicial remedy, even though it requested both legal and equitable relief against the telephone company.</SPAN></P>

The minor, who had been issued a citation for underage drinking, contended that the penalties imposed by 18 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor contended that &sect; 6310.4 was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating against him because of his age. He claimed there was no rational relationship between the penalties imposed by &sect; 6310.4 and the harm sought to be avoided. The court stressed that the United States Supreme Court had not held that a classification based upon age was a suspect classification warranting review under the strict scrutiny test. Furthermore, the minor failed to establish that driving was a fundamental right requiring review under the strict scrutiny test. The court found that the classification, i.e., status as a minor, served the Commonwealth's legitimate government interest in controlling alcohol use and abuse among minors. Because operating a vehicle on state roads was a privilege and preventing operation of vehicles by drivers under the influence promoted public safety, a rational basis could be found between underage drinking and traffic safety. In denying the appeal, the court held that the minor should have addressed his conviction for underage drinking within the criminal appeals process rather than collaterally attacking his license suspension.</SPAN></P>

There was competent evidence to uphold the jury's verdict that the executor timely filed his action in that the decedent knew or should have known that he had an asbestos-related injury or disease in 1980. Moreover, a new trial was not appropriate because the verdict was not contrary to the weight of the evidence, and the trial court's failure to charge on apportionment was proper because any apportionment would have been a result of speculation.

The words &quot;possessed&quot; and &quot;deadly weapon&quot; in &sect; 303.4 were not unconstitutionally vague, and the application of the enhancement did not deprive defendant of due process or equal protection rights. Application of the enhancement to a murder in the third degree charge was proper because the Pennsylvania Sentencing Commission was vested with power to promulgate the guidelines. No double punishment occurred because a third degree murder could be accomplished without use of a deadly weapon, and defendant's acquittal of the possession of an instrument of crime charge did not prevent the enhancement.</SPAN></P>
