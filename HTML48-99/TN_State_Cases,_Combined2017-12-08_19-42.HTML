</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the grandparents and great-grandparents of respondent mother's son, challenged the juvenile court's grant of summary judgment to respondent as to petitioners' suit seeking visitation rights under the Grandparents Visitation Rights Act (GVRA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-6-306 (1997). The child's father, petitioners' son and grandson, had never married respondent; he was subsequently killed in an automobile accident. On appeal, the court followed precedent set by another panel of the appeals court holding that the GVRA was an unconstitutional invasion of privacy rights under the Tennessee Constitution because the statute permitted grandparental visitation without a prior evaluation of whether the child's best interests would be harmed by a cessation in the grandparental relationship. The court affirmed the dismissal of petitioners' suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, convicted of murder, appealed an order from the Chancery Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which dismissed his request for a declaratory judgment. As applied to felonies committed prior to the enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-20-112, which made all felonies infamous crimes, plaintiff claimed that the provisions of the statute violated the ex post facto prohibitions of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of murder. On the date the crime was committed, murder was not an infamous crime. Subsequently, the Tennessee legislature amended Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-20-112 to make all felonies infamous crimes resulting in a loss of the right to vote. Plaintiff sought a declaration that the law, as applied to him, violated the ex post facto provisions of Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Plaintiff also relied on Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5 and its guarantee of the right of suffrage. The trial court granted defendant state's motion to dismiss, disagreeing with plaintiff's argument that his crime must have been infamous at the time it was committed. The court held that plaintiff's act could be declared infamous as it was committed before enactment of the statute and prior to his conviction. The court also found that the laws disenfranchising convicted felons were simply remedial statutes that did not increase criminal penalties. Accordingly, the court held that such laws were not ex post facto laws within the prohibition of the state or federal constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting defendant state's motion to dismiss, and remanded. Defendant's murder offense could be declared infamous where it was committed prior to enactment of the statute making all felonies infamous crimes. Laws disenfranchising convicted felons were remedial statutes that did not increase criminal penalties. Because the laws were not criminal statutes, ex post facto prohibitions did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city and defendant city council appealed an order of the Hamilton County Chancery Court (Tennessee) vacating defendants' denial of plaintiff development company's rezoning petition and requiring defendants to rezone the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff development company requested defendant city and defendant city council rezone a tract of land. Defendants' order denying plaintiff's request was vacated by the trial court and defendants sought review. The court held that the trial court properly treated plaintiff's initial appeal of defendants' actions as a declaratory judgment action, admitting all evidence relevant to defendants' denial of plaintiff's rezoning request. But the trial court improperly determined that defendants' action was illegal, arbitrary, or capricious. Defendants' denial of plaintiff's rezoning request was not an abuse of discretion and was supported by several reasons. The trial court could not reverse defendants' decision merely because it disagreed with defendants' reasoning. Defendants did not have to provide the best use of the property and properly used their discretion to zone as they felt proper. Because there were beneficial uses available for the property at issue, there was no basis for a finding that there would be an unconstitutional taking of property absent rezoning. The court thus reversed the order vacating defendants' decision and reinstated their finding.</SPAN></P>

Further, there was no basis for a finding that there would be an unconstitutional taking of the property absent rezoning.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner contended that the Act, though passed following the imposition of his sentences, should have been applied retroactively to his case and would have provided a reduced sentence and an opportunity to receive good time jail credit. Respondent denied the request and the lower court affirmed. The court of appeals also affirmed, finding that petitioner was not entitled to retroactive application of the Act. The purpose of the Act was to address the issue of overcrowding and specifically limited application to persons who were not previously sentenced.

Appellant challenged the constitutionality and application of the child support guidelines. The trial court entered judgment against appellant, applied the child support guidelines, and denied appellant relief on the grounds that he had come into court with unclean hands. The appellate court concluded that the matter should be remanded to the trial court for consideration of the new regulations. Changes in the child support guidelines became effective after a trial on the petition for increase in support, but prior to entry of the trial court's final order. The appellate court held the matter should be remanded in the interests of judicial economy. The doctrine of unclean hands, per se, was not sufficient to deny appellant the right to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, rule or regulation or its application. An unconstitutional statute or an amendment to a constitutional statute was void ab initio.

Defendant industrial development board counterclaimed against plaintiff to rescind the option to purchase and filed a summary judgment motion on the issue. Plaintiff appealed the grant of summary judgment arguing improper joinder of claims. The court agreed with plaintiff noting that the claims were different in nature because defendant's claim was a normal action as opposed to plaintiff's appeal of a denial of a zoning request by writ of certiorari.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother filed a petition to establish appellant father's paternity of her unborn child. Testing showed that appellant was the father to a near certainty. Appellant requested the juvenile court to dismiss the action because the paternity statutes violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. His motion was denied and an order was entered establishing his paternity and directing payment of child support. On appeal of the denial of appellant's motion, the court recognized the constitutional protection afforded the right to procreate. However, the court found that that right was irrelevant to paternity actions, which resulted from the private acts of the biological parents and that any private wrong interfering with a man's procreational autonomy did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Rejecting appellant's claim that paternity actions violated equal protection guarantees, the court found that any different treatment accorded women after conception stemmed from the operation of nature rather than state law. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the paternity statutes did not violate the right to privacy or equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the juvenile court establishing appellant father's paternity of appellee mother's son. The court held that appellant's motion to dismiss on Fourteenth Amendment grounds was properly denied because the paternity statutes did not violate his rights to equal protection or to privacy.</SPAN></P>

The Chancery Court of Maury County at Columbia, Tennessee denied defendants' motion to dismiss, and they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county commission ratified and set the tax, but it later declared that it would not be imposed at that time. The commission set the tax rate at $ 0.00 for both residential and non-residential development, and no tax had been collected under the Tax Act. The association filed its action under the Declaratory Judgment Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-14-101 to 113. Defendants maintained that the challenged tax had never been imposed, that there was no real threat that it would be imposed, and that the case did not involve a justiciable controversy. The court found that before the tax could be collected, it had to first be set above a rate of zero by the commission. There was no indication in the record that the commission would choose to raise the rate above zero and enforce the tax statute. The challenged tax had not been imposed, and there was no indication in the record that it would be imposed. Therefore, at the time of the lawsuit, a controversy existed only in a theoretical sense. Consequently, there was no justiciable controversy under the Tennessee Declaratory Judgment Act. The trial court erred in denying defendants' motion to dismiss, and the decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff and defendant were competitors. Plaintiff alleged that defendant interfered with its contractual relations by actively soliciting plaintiffs employees and by misrepresenting that the restrictive covenants, which plaintiff had its employees sign, were unenforceable. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and issued an injunction. The injunction enjoined defendant from inducing former employees to breach the restrictive covenants in other states, from misrepresenting facts concerning the enforceability of the covenants, or from litigating or assisting others in litigating in other states regarding the enforceability of the restrictive covenants. On appeal, the court reversed the injunctive order, finding that the enforceability of the covenants depended on the factual circumstances and the laws and public policy of the state in which the employee was located. Consequently, the court determined that if defendant expressed the view that the covenant were not be enforceable in a given situation, the truth of the statement depended on the factual circumstances and the law in the state involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contended, inter alia, that &sect; 36-6-306 was unconstitutional because it authorized courts to order grandparent visitation upon a finding that such visitation was in the &quot;best interest&quot; of the child without first requiring the finding of a danger of substantial harm to the child. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court. The court observed that parents possessed a constitutional right of privacy in parenting decisions not subject to interference from the state absent a showing of substantial harm to the child. The court reasoned that there was no real difference between the rights of a single parent and both parents. The court held that the language of &sect; 36-6-306, allowing reasonable visitation rights to grandparents upon a finding of the best interest of the minor child, constituted an unconstitutional invasion of privacy rights under the Tennessee Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of two counts of rape of a child and sentenced to two concurrent 20-year terms. The inmate did not present any disputed facts, and his plea for relief rested on conclusions of law alone. Just as there was no requirement or need for a prior factual inquiry, there was no reason to remand the case to the Department. The inmate failed to demonstrate that he had standing to raise any issues related to the governor's pardoning power; the record did not reveal that he applied to the governor for leniency, and he did not allege that the governor had been prevented from pardoning him by virtue of the workings of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-523. The inmate was not entitled to have the challenged statute examined under the strict scrutiny standard; he was not a member of any suspect class by virtue of his post-1992 conviction of rape, and he had at least temporarily forfeited his fundamental right to personal liberty by virtue of a valid conviction and sentence, imposed through due process of law. The application of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-13-523 to the inmate's sentence was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the law created a new right for adopted persons, so it was a substantive change in the law and not a procedural or remedial one.

The court held that the trial court improperly modified and interpreted the applicable statutory language. The court held the hospitalization requirement for pregnancies more than three months along was not unduly burdensome. The court held the statute's requirements that only the attending physician could provide patients with mandatory counseling, which had to include all of the options, available assistance agencies known to the physician should the patient chose to give birth, and risks associated with the abortion procedure, were not unduly burdensome. The court held that, in and of itself, the mandatory two day waiting period was not burdensome. However, the court held that the combined effect of the physician only counseling and the mandatory waiting period operated to unconditionally burden a woman's exercise of her procreational rights. The court also held that the medical emergency exceptions to the abortion regulations were unconstitutionally narrow because they failed to provide protection for a woman's health and only covered circumstances threatening a woman's life.</SPAN></P>

The lower court awarded the doctors summary judgment and enjoined the district from operating PPOs and companies in which it owned stock. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the district's conduct was not prohibited under Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 29, 31 because the district was not a county, city, or town, but was a quasi-municipal entity, and because the word &quot;state&quot; could did not include an arm of the state. Nor was the conduct prohibited under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because there was no law forbidding the district from operating a PPO, the doctors had no vested right to employment with the district, and the district had a rational economic basis for terminating the doctors' contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment for appellee doctors because appellant hospital district's conduct was not unconstitutional. The district was not forbidden from operating a preferred provider organization because it was not a county, city, or town, and the word &quot;state&quot; did not encompass an arm of the state. The doctors had no vested right to work for the district, which had a rational basis for ending the doctors' contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge filed an action to enjoin an election for judicial seats under the Tennessee Plan, alleging that its provision for selection and retention of state judges was unconstitutional and that it virtually insured the name of the incumbent on the ballot, which eliminated the right for appellate judges to be elected by the qualified voters. The trial court held that the Tennessee Plan was unconstitutional because it drastically limited the group of persons who could become appellate judges. The Coordinator was permanently enjoined from following the procedures of the Tennessee Plan in conducting elections for the seats. Both parties appealed. The court reversed the decision, holding that the Plan was not unconstitutional. The Plan did not drastically limit the group of persons who could become appellate judges, it simply structured an application procedure designed to insure the quality of the judges while minimizing the politics of the process. The court also found that the Plan contained requirements that the incumbent serve satisfactorily in order to be on the ballet, which eliminated the automatic right to be included on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

The petition, filed under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-322, urged that the petitioner had accumulated enough good time credits to be eligible for immediate release from prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was sentenced to 99 years in prison for first degree murder. After over 20 years in prison, he filed a petition for declaratory relief with the state Department of Corrections. Petitioner argued that under three different sentence credit programs, he had accumulated enough good time credits to be released. The department denied the petition, and the chancery court affirmed the department's decision. Petitioner argued on appeal that he was entitled to both good and honor time credits available when he was first incarcerated, as well as to the good conduct sentence credits authorized by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-229. The court explained that &sect; 41-29-229 replaced the older systems of earning sentence credits. Petitioner was entitled to the good and honor time credits earned before enactment of &sect; 41-29-229 and to good sentence credits under the new statute thereafter. Petitioner's argument that the recalculation of his sentence violated the Ex Post Facto clause was meritless, because &sect; 41-29-299 decreased petitioner's sentence. Finally, the court found that the department had correctly calculated petitioner's good and honor time. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners purchased residential property and sought a zone change so that the property could be used for mini-warehouses. The planning commission recommended the change but apprised the owners of the fact that the ordinance would have to pass three readings before the board of mayor and aldermen. The ordinance passed the first two readings, but when moved for passage on third and final reading, it failed for lack of a second. The trial court found that the city's denial of the requested zoning change was supported by the record. On appeal, the owners argued that the board's action should be set aside because the board refused to re-zone the property solely on the basis of neighborhood opposition, and that the caselaw Hoover standard made the board's decision arbitrary. The appellate court held that the owners' reliance on the Hoover standard was fundamentally flawed, as it involved a board acting in an administrative or quasi-judicial capacity. The legislators of the city were not to be condemned for doing their job, and the common law writ of certiorari was not the appropriate vehicle by which to review the &quot;purely legislative&quot; acts of the legislative body.</SPAN></P>

The building official ordered that each of the structures be demolished pursuant to the Kingsport, Tenn. Code &sect; 6-323(c). The trial court affirmed the building official's order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Portions of the town were located in three counties. The town's city court was located in Roane County. The officials would prosecute criminal cases in the city court regardless of which county they were committed in. The chancery court concluded that the officials could continue to prosecute state cases arising in Anderson County provided that it first obtained a waiver of the right to venue from each defendant. The attorney general contended that a criminal defendant did not possess a general, unconditional right to waive venue. He argued that a change or waiver of venue may only be accomplished pursuant to Tenn. R. Crim. P. 21(a) or Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-214, and when neither of these provisions applied, offenses committed in the Anderson County portion of the town must be tried in Anderson County. The court reversed the judgment. The court held that the town's blanket policy and practice of trying Anderson County cases in Roane County, premised, as it was, on the false proposition that a defendant had an absolute right to waive venue, constituted an unlawful expansion of a defendant's right to waive venue beyond that permitted by the provisions of Rule 21(a) and &sect; 40-35-214.</SPAN></P>

The chancery court dismissed both actions. The candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senatorial candidate argued that the Tennessee law applied because U.S. Const. amend. X reserved certain powers to the states, including the right to oversee elections within their borders. The court held that Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), 2 U.S.C.S. &sect; 431 et seq., controlled the issue along with the Supremacy Clause. The court found that Congress intended FECA to control and preempt state laws in the arena of federal elections. In affirming, the court held that U.S. Const. amend. X did not reserve to the states the power to regulate campaign financing for federal elections. The court held that the power to do so was specifically assigned to Congress, and Congress chose to exercise its power in the federal election arena to the exclusion of all other governments. The court held that a valid and legal contribution allowed by FECA could not be prohibited by state law, just as such a contribution made illegal by FECA could not be made legal by state law.</SPAN></P>

The Chancery Court of Lincoln County at Fayetteville (Tennessee) dismissed the property owners' complaint and granted the county officials' counterclaim to enjoin the owners from willfully allowing their cattle to roam at large along the road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners raised cattle. They placed stock gaps (cattle guards) at the point where the subject road crossed their property. Because the pastures on both sides of the road were unfenced, the cattle crossed the road at will, especially when they were fed near the road. The county officials passed a resolution that required all property owners in the area to remove the cattle guards. The property owners refused to abide by the resolution because they argued that the road was private, and the county had no right to regulate it. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the road was a public road under the theories of either an implied dedication and acceptance by the county and/or a prescriptive right obtained by adverse use for more than 20 years. The court found that the record contained ample evidence of twenty years of continuous, open, visible and uninterrupted use of the road by the public and by the employees and agents of the county. The court also held that the county had the right to require the property owners to keep their cattle off of the road.</SPAN></P>

The Law Court of Sullivan County (Tennessee) dismissed the violation of statute claim and granted summary judgment on the remaining causes of action. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was a 17 year old minor when she contracted for an abortion. Section 39-15-202, a criminal statute, required that if a person was under 18 years of age that the attending physician would inform that person's parents of the contemplated procedure two days prior-to the abortive procedure being performed on the minor. The trial court held that portions of &sect; 39-15-202 were unconstitutional. Plaintiffs appealed the grant of summary judgment on their malpractice and battery claims. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that under the rule that an appellate court will only consider constitutional issues if the matter may not otherwise be resolved, no private civil right of action existed for the alleged violations of the remainder of the statute. Summary judgment in favor of defendants was proper for the battery and malpractice claims because: (1) plaintiffs failed to rebut the doctor's affidavit regarding the applicable medical standard of care, and (2) plaintiffs failed to rebut the presumption, for the battery claim, that the daughter was presumed to have the capacity to consent to the abortion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proprietor contended that &sect; 4.2, which prohibited the practice of bringing your own alcoholic beverage into restaurants and clubs during certain business hours, was invalid. The court held that the authority over beer and other beverages not falling within the definition of &quot;alcoholic beverage&quot; might have been controlled and regulated by local governmental agencies. In reversing and remanding, the court held that &sect; 4.2 placed the onus upon a proprietor of an affected business to ascertain whether his customers were in possession of alcoholic beverages upon entering the business premises. Intent or knowledge that a customer was in possession of alcohol was not a part of the ordinance. Therefore, simple possession by a patron of an alcoholic beverage or beer on the premises of the business subjected a proprietor to liability. Thus, the court concluded that &sect; 4.2 as written was overly broad to the extent that it was unduly and overly vague. The ordinance did not establish minimal guidelines or for that matter any guidelines for its enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The issues were: 1) whether a party can bring an action pursuant to the Act against the State; 2) whether a party can bring a declaratory judgment action against TBP; and 3) whether a party must comply with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-225(b) before filing an action for a declaratory order. The court found that the chancery court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because there was no evidence that the Tennessee General Assembly affirmatively authorized suits against the State when it enacted the Act. The court held that the inmate could not bring a declaratory judgment action against TBP under either the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-106(c), or the Act.

The petition for termination of parental rights was to be filed where the children and the foster parents intended to reside. That county was the one in which the original removal petition had been brought. There was insufficient evidence to prove that the children resided in the county where the juvenile court was located except temporarily.

The court held that the proper procedure for a state employee to obtain an authoritative answer to the question of his employment status was the filing of a declaratory order with the commissioner pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-223. The employee was given 30 days to comply with the proper procedure. The court also held that there was no basis for a &sect; 1983 action until there had been a determination that the employee was a career service employee with a federally secured property interest in his position.

The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners asserted that the ordinance was invalid, as it touched the municipality boundaries only on the area of a right-of-way previously annexed. Hence, the annexation of their property was invalid, as their property did not adjoin the municipal boundaries. Additionally they charged that the annexed area contained no &quot;residents,&quot; as required by the enabling legislation and that, as the county elected to adopt a &quot;home rule charter&quot; form of government, it was a municipality within the meaning of the enabling statute, and thus, its territories were not subject to annexation. The appellate court held that, as counties, home-rule or otherwise, were not included in the definition of &quot;municipality&quot; or &quot;municipalities&quot; in the definitions section of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51, which related solely to changes in municipal boundaries, it seemed clear that there was no merit in the contention of the property owners that the county was a municipality, as that term related to annexation. To hold otherwise would have meant that municipalities located within a county that adopted home-rule government would be proscribed from exercising any annexation authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court ruled in favor of the ex-wife and psychologist. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision, with the exception of the father's claim for libel. The court held that the psychologist was required by law to report her suspicions of child abuse and was immune from such a lawsuit based on the allegations of her report of suspected sexual abuse. There was no evidence of bad faith or malicious intent, nor of outrageous conduct, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and interference with their constitutionally protected right to a familial relationship based on the immunity granted. However, because the psychologist sent copies of her letter to two other parties, the court reversed on the libel count, and the court tolled the statute of limitations because the father was unable to obtain a copy of the letter.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, the court held that the amendment was valid as long as it was passed in accordance with the super-majority requirements of the metropolitan charter and, accordingly, remanded the case for a definitive factual determination of that issue. The court stated that any zoning ordinance that conflicted with the general plan or that had been disapproved by the planning commission was nevertheless valid if it was enacted in accordance with the super-majority requirements of Nashville, Tenn., Metro. Charter &sect; 18.02. The court vacated and remanded to determine whether the ordinance was enacted in compliance with Nashville, Tenn., Metro. Charter &sect;&sect; 5.02, 18.02.</SPAN></P>

Eleven years later, the prisoner's death sentence was vacated by a criminal court, and he was resentenced to life imprisonment. The prisoner alleged that he was entitled to retroactive credits for the time he had been on death row. In affirming the trial court's judgment that denied relief to the prisoner, the court ruled that appellee prison warden did not abuse his discretion by declining to award the prisoner sentence credits for his activities while he was on death row. He was not constitutionally entitled to such credits, and such denial did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Corrections when he was transferred to different facilities. During the transfers several items of his personal property was missing, including a prayer rug. When he reported the loss, the Commissioner told the inmate that the rug was to be of a certain size, have a fire retardant label, and have a nonskid back. The inmate alleged that prayer rugs were not made with such a label or a nonskid back. He then brought an action against defendant for a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000bb et seq. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the claim, and the court affirmed that judgment. The court held that because the inmate failed to show that the prayer tug was essential or a central tenant to the practice of his religion, the reasonable restrictions placed of their use did not violate the inmate's constitutional rights. Moreover, neither the State nor its officials were &quot;persons&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 1983.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case was previously appealed and remanded. It concerned the way in which the Department of Correction calculated the inmate's good conduct sentence credits. The Department offered different probationary parole dates in affidavits and did not explain the differences between them and why their dates were different than the dates in the earlier proceeding. The court rejected the inmate's argument that the various good conduct credit statutes were applied in an ex post facto way. Including the inmate in new sentence credit programs under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-229, -230 did not increase his punishment. The inmate provided the trial court with his own calculations. The Department filed affidavits containing the results of its calculations without the calculations themselves. The court found this filing inadequate because it did not enable the court to determine how the Department arrived at its figure. There were too many variables in the calculation of the sentence credits to accept the results of the Department's calculations on their face. The concern was underscored by the fact that the Department's and the inmate's calculations produced different and unexplained results.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment dismissing the inmate's ex post facto claims and vacated the remaining portions of the summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner appealed a judgment from the Chancery Court of Davidson County and Nashville, Tennessee, which dismissed his petition for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, his warden and the Department of Correction, to change his security classification so that he could be transferred to a minimum security annex or to a community corrections center.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of committing a rape while on parole from a conviction for another sexual offense. When the prisoner was sentenced, the Department apparently had a policy that allowed all inmates to be considered for minimum custody classification if they were within 10 years of their earliest release date and met certain other conditions. However, a new policy was implemented that did not permit the transfer of sex offenders to minimum custody until they were within 10 years of the expiration of their sentences. The prisoner sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Department to change his security classification, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the Department's new policy did not constitute forbidden ex post facto punishment because the length of the prisoner's sentence was unchanged by the new policy. The court also found that the policy did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Treating prisoners differently based on their offenses did not violate the Equal Protection Clause where the treatment was related to a legitimate state interest of protecting the public from sexual offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gambler wrote several checks at the casino's establishment in Nevada to purchase game chips. After the checks were dishonored, the casino obtained a money judgment against the gambler in Nevada. The casino then filed a motion in a Tennessee trial court to enforce the Nevada judgment. The trial court granted the motion, and the gambler appealed. The court affirmed. The constitutional mandate of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution required credit to be given to a money judgment rendered on a civil cause of action in another state, even though the forum would have been under no duty to entertain the suit on which the judgment was founded. Where an action was brought on a judgment rendered by a court of a sister state, the Full Faith and Credit Clause prohibited an inquiry into the merits of the original cause of action. The court further found that none of the recognized exceptions to the application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause were present here.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, children and next of kin of the deceased, sought review of a judgment of the General Sessions Court, Probate Division for Scott County (Tennessee) which first denied their motion to dismiss the petition for probate filed by appellee sibling of the children. The trial judge thereafter found that it was appropriate for the estate to be probated and granted letters of administration to a licensed attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died in 1980, and no petition seeking to administer his estate was filed until October 17, 1996, some two weeks after his widow's death. The trial court overruled appellants' motion to dismiss. Appellants argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 30-1-110(4) was in full force and effect from the date of the decedent's death until repealed some 13 years later and that it would be an unconstitutional application of the repealing statute to hold it invalid under the facts of the case. The court found that a probate proceeding was a unique one and for the most part unadversarial. For that reason the court declined to equate a daughter's right not to have her father's estate probated with the right of a wrongdoer not to be sued. The suit was also not barred by the catchall provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-3-110(3). The court found that the issue of letters to administer a decedent's estate was a unique proceeding to be distinguished from the types of adversarial causes of actions contemplated by &sect; 28-3-110. Also, the legislature did not repeal the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 30-1-110(4) so the exact statutory period of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-3-110(3) would become effective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause so that the estate could be fully administered.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, concluding that the supreme court's denial of the board's permission to appeal by concurring with the results only did not preclude the decision from becoming the law of the case because the disposition simply precluded publication of the opinion. The law of the case doctrine applied even though the constitutional issues were decided by implication because it was clear that the issues were indeed decided where failure to decide them would have rendered the prior decision meaningless and resulted in an incomplete resolution of the issues before the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jurors class action sought a declaration that in capital cases the exclusion of persons from serving on juries based upon their religious opposition to the death penalty violated Tenn.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment that dismissed the action. The court determined that the practice of excluding jurors whose religious principles prevented them from considering the death penalty regardless of the law and the evidence was not an unconstitutional religious test, did not violate the jurors' constitutionally protected freedom of religion, and did not unconstitutionally discriminate against the jurors. The court noted that the right to trial by jury secured by the state and federal constitutions necessarily contemplated that an unbiased and impartial jury. The jurors were properly excluded because they stated, in effect, that they were not impartial and unbiased.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife sought a divorce on the ground that the husband engaged in inappropriate marital conduct. Based on the manner in which the husband practiced his religious beliefs, the wife was granted a divorce. The trial court's decree required the husband to enroll in a program of anger management, and the husband's visitation rights were conditioned upon the approval of a guardian ad litem. The decree also provided that before the husband could obtain visitation rights, a petition had to be filed by the guardian. Upon appeal, the trial court's decree was modified, and as modified it was affirmed. The court held that although a trial court had no authority to grant a divorce based on religious beliefs alone, it could grant a divorce based upon the manner in which the husband practiced his religion. The court ruled that it was improper for the trial court to condition the husband's visitation rights upon the guardian's approval; approval of visitation was a function of the trial court. The court also held that Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 guaranteed that Tennessee's courts were to be open to all.

The trial court had reduced the award for the amount of the medical malpractice judgment awarded to the client's ex-wife. The client also challenged an order denying his claim for prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney represented the client in a medical malpractice action. Pursuant to the contingent fee arrangement, the attorney received 50 percent of the settlement. The client and his wife divorced, and she was given a portion of that award for her loss of consortium. The client instituted an action against the attorney, alleging that the contingency fee violated Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-26-120 (1980), which limited contingency fees to 33 1/3 percent. Following two appeals, the trial court awarded the client the excess fee but deducted one-fourth as the share awarded to the client's ex-wife. On appeal, the court modified and affirmed the judgment, holding that under the doctrine of unjust enrichment, the client was entitled to the full amount of the excess fees. The court found that the attorney would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain the benefit of the ex-wife's portion of the excess fees. The court denied the client's claim for prejudgment interest, holding that although the attorney's fee was certain, it was unclear whether the dispute of his obligation was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Winchester, Tenn., Mun. Ord. 7-501, which was passed in 1983 and amended in 1996, prohibited the sale of fireworks within the city.

The court held that: (1) the trial court did not err in holding that the Council's actions in denying appellant a fireworks permit were neither arbitrary nor capricious because the ordinance did not contain any exceptions; (2) the trial court was without jurisdiction to determine whether the Council's decision as to intervening petitioner was an abuse of discretion because the constraints of the writ of certiorari limited the trial court's jurisdiction to the single issue of whether the Council's decision as to appellant exceeded the council's jurisdiction or whether the council acted illegally, fraudulently, or arbitrarily; and (3) the ordinance was not a zoning ordinance because it was in no way connected to the land.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 24-7-112(b)(2)(B), and ordered defendant to make child support payments, in a paternity action filed by plaintiff state, as assignee of the mother of a minor child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an action to obtain a judgment of paternity and support payments against defendant. A DNA test established a 99.71 percent of probability of defendant's paternity of the child. Although defendant contested the action, the trial court granted the state's summary judgment motion based on the statute which, among other things, established a conclusive, irrebutable presumption of paternity in cases in which scientific tests showed the statistical probability of an individual's paternity to be 99 percent or greater. On appeal, the court held that the statute violated defendant's right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, because both the child and a defendant in a paternity action had a compelling interest in the accuracy of a paternity determination, which outweighed the state's interest in easing its administrative burden; and the irrebutable presumption of paternity effectively denied a putative father a meaningful opportunity to be heard. The court concluded that the state's motion for summary judgment should have been denied and the matter should have been permitted to proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court to provide defendant the opportunity to rebut the presumption of paternity attached to a 99.71 percent probability of paternity.</SPAN></P>

The inmates appealed, contending that the trial court should amend its judgment because the inmates had complied with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-223. The court disagreed, holding that the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act provided that the inmates had not first sought a declaratory judgment from the controlling agency, that the court lacked jurisdiction to review an agency's actions through a declaratory judgment proceeding without the agency first addressing the inmates' issues, and that the judicial declaratory judgment action was premature because the inmates proceeded directly to judicial review without first seeking an administrative determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and appellee mother were divorced approximately one and a half years after the birth of their son. Temporary custody was awarded to the grandmother. Upon his petition for modification, the father was awarded custody of the child and the grandmother was granted visitation with the child every other weekend. On appeal the issue was whether the grandmother was entitled to visitation with child. Although the grandmother had custody, her visitation was first ordered in the order that was the subject of the appeal, the change of custody from her to the father. Once the father was granted custody, he had the right to decide whether the grandmother could have visitation. The statement of the evidence on the hearing on the father's petition to modify the decree to award him sole custody of the child indicated that the father and the grandmother had some disagreements over his visitation with the child as well as payment of child support. The record did not indicate whether the trial court made any determination as to whether a denial of visitation to the grandmother with the child would have resulted in a substantial danger of harm to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A criminal court judge entered an ex parte order that directed a bank to freeze the owner's accounts because there was probable cause to believe that the money was traceable to illegal drug trafficking. The police mailed notices of a forfeiture proceeding under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 53-11-451(a)(6)(A) (1996) to the owner's address at the time of arrest although he had moved. A postal forwarding order was in effect and the owner received one of two notices. On appeal, the court held that due process required authorities to exert reasonable efforts to provide notice to persons who might have an interest in the property and the method of notice must be reasonably calculated to appraise all interested persons of the proceeding in order to enable them to present their claims or objections. The court found that the use of the old address alone would not have been sufficient, but the change of address form supported the conclusion that the method was reasonable. The court held that there was no requirement of actual delivery since many persons avoided acceptance of certified mail and noted that the evidence here indicated that the owner had purposely attempted to avoid notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When shots were fired by the officers during a disturbance at a neighbor's home, the woman was injured when a bullet struck her in the face. The woman brought an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging constitutional violations, as well as negligence. The trial court found that the reckless, now deceased, neighbor was more at fault and the fault should be apportioned to the officers and the woman. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, holding that: (1) the woman was not negligent for looking at the disturbance from her storm door because that it was reasonable for a person to watch a person being arrested for disturbing the peace; (2) the actions of the neighbor were too remote to require the allocation of 75 percent of the fault because no injuries would have resulted but for the negligent actions of the officers who improperly entered a home with their guns drawn, without investigating the circumstances or announcing their presence, in violation of the metro guidelines; and (3) the metro violated the woman's Fourteenth Amendment due process rights because it failed to properly train the officers, which was customary, and such failure caused her injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the trial court dismissing the woman's constitutional claim and the officers and assessing fault. The cause was remanded for further necessary proceedings including the proper assessment of damages and a hearing on the merits of the &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff, clerk, and county employee contended that the business owner operated a barber shop and that he provided a taxable service. After motions to dismiss were granted, the business owner appealed.

They claimed that they visited weekly with the child until appellee mother said they couldn't see the child anymore. The trial court denied their petition for visitation rights. On appeal, the grandparents claimed that the test to be applied in determining whether they were entitled to visitation rights was the best interest of the child standard. The court affirmed the denial of visitation rights and held that parents possessed a constitutional right of privacy in parenting decisions that was not subject to interference from the State absent a showing of substantial harm to a child's welfare. Further, without a showing of substantial harm to the child, a court could not constitutionally impose its own notions of the best interest of the child. In the instant case, although the court appreciated the desires of the grandparents to continue their relationship with the child, there was no evidence of substantial harm to the child and, therefore, no compelling state interest to justify state interference with the right of the mother to prevent contact between the child and the grandparents.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the communication company's appeal for lack of jurisdiction and concluded that ratepayers, such as the communications company, had no due process rights to the charging of particular rates. As such, the company was forbidden from challenging the legislation at issue because the company could object to the charging of a particular rate. The court found that the communications company had failed to set forth any statutory or constitutional provisions which required the TPSC to provide the company with an opportunity to be heard before the implementation of the price regulation, thus, the proceeding was not a contested case as defined in Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the money seized was subject to forfeiture under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 53-11-451(a)(6)(A).

Therefore, Tennessee's administrative forfeiture statutes, which did not provide for a jury trial, did not run afoul of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The court also held that the forfeiture proceedings did not violate the claimant's due process rights because neither the commissioner nor his department could have benefited from the forfeiture proceeding since the money at issue was seized by a local law enforcement agency and because the 41 month delay between the seizure of the money and the forfeiture hearing did not undermine his ability to present his claim.

The individuals appealed on numerous grounds. The court affirmed, first holding that the board had the authority under the Local Approval Law, Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an order of the trial court, the State was given legal possession of 1.42 acres of a 2.27-acre tract of land owned by the landowners. During the trial held to determine the sufficiency of compensation, both parties introduced expert testimony as to the value of the land taken and incidental damages to the remaining property. The jury awarded compensation and damages in the amount of $ 55,000, and the landowners appealed. In affirming, the court found that the landowners waived their right to contest the trial court's failure to consider certain incidental damages incurred as the result of the taking because they failed to file a motion for a new trial, which, under Tenn. R. App. P. 3(e), was a prerequisite to a review of the issue. The court further found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-16-114 (1980), which governed damages in a condemnation proceeding, was not blatantly unconstitutional, and thus, the landowners' challenge to its constitutionality could not be further reviewed because the issue had not been raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was married when the putative father claimed that they had an affair. The putative father filed a petition for legitimation. The trial court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-202 (Supp. 1995) was constitutional on its face under the state and federal constitution. However, the mother's erratic relationship with her husband was a mockery of lawful wedlock and that the putative father was allowed to file his petition for legitimation. The court reversed because the putative father lacked standing to bring the legitimation action. The statute only allowed the petition to be filed as to children not born in wedlock. The general assembly intended the statute to apply to the children of unmarried women. The restrictive interpretation was necessary to preserve the integrity of families and the same protections did not extend to putative fathers. The statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment when the putative father had no common-law right to legitimate the child. It did not violate the putative father's right to equal protection when any constitutionally cognizable interest the putative father had was outweighed by the competing public interest of preserving the family.</SPAN></P>

The father agreed to not subject the child to cigarette smoke during visitation. The father was also prohibited from being around the mother's residence.

The child also suffered a cigarette burn on her hand during a visit with her father. The trial court found the father guilty of criminal contempt and suspended his visitations. In affirming, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding of contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the court was not permitted to disturb the final judgment of the trial court. Moreover, the father was not able to challenge the validity of the no-smoking rule because he did not object at the trial court level.

After the trial court ruled in favor of the wife, the husband appealed. The husband contended on appeal that the trial court erred in ordering him to cash out the funds in his two annuity accounts because the accounts were part of his optional retirement program and as such, were exempt from execution or any other process pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-5-501, 8-36-111, and 26-2-104. The husband conceded that the pension funds were martial assets. The wife responded that the order was directed solely to husband, rather than to the state or its agencies. The court agreed and noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2-104(a) prohibited the &quot;execution, attachment, or garnishment&quot; of state pension funds.

Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-202 in 1992, and again in 1994, it did not change the language of the statute to include children born to married women. The court found that the statute was not defective on due process grounds because it created rights rather than taking them away. The court determined that the father's equal protection rights were not violated by the state giving the right to legitimate a child to a man who fathers a baby by an unmarried woman while denying that right to men whose children were the product of a liaison with a married woman. The court found that a man seeking to legitimate a child born to a married woman was in a fundamentally different position from a man seeking to legitimate a child born to an unmarried woman.

The husband knew the address and phone number of the wife's parents, but he made no attempt to contact them to let the wife know of the impending divorce proceedings. A default judgment was entered against the wife. On appeal, the wife argued that the decree was void because the method of serving process upon her violated her rights to due process. The court found that the husband verbally informed the wife that he had obtained a restraining order and was going to file for divorce. However, in the context of a relationship in which there was active mistrust between the parties, the verbal statement was not sufficient to relieve the husband of his obligation to make a reasonable effort to ascertain the wife's whereabouts and serve notice on her.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents filed a petition seeking visitation with their minor granddaughter. The mother, who had been awarded full custody in her divorce suit, opposed the petition. The mother remarried. Her new husband was not a party to the action. The petition did not allege that the mother was an unfit parent or that she had engaged in any parental misconduct. The trial court, after a non-jury hearing, found visitation to be in the child's best interests, and, acting under the GVA, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-6-302, awarded visitation. On appeal, the mother raised the issue of whether the grant of visitation rights to her parents, made over her objection and with no showing of injury to the child or parental unfitness, violated her right to privacy under the Tennessee Constitution. In reversing and remanding, the court held that, absent a finding of substantial harm to the child, the state could not constitutionally interfere with a parent's right to make child-rearing decisions by ordering grandparents' visitation against a parent's wishes. Thus, the trial court erred in ordering visitation over the mother's objection when no allegations of harm to the child were made in the present case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator sought to recover taxes paid to the county under protest on stone removed from the quarry from March 8, 1993, to May 31, 1993, on the ground that the enabling legislation for the tax was unconstitutional under Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8. Relying on a decision holding that exclusion of counties from a Tennessee severance tax law based on population violated Tenn. Const. Art. I, &sect; 8 and Tenn. Const. Art. XI, &sect; 8, the operator argued that 1983 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 111, authorizing the collection of severance tax by the county was unconstitutional. The court found that the operator's argument that the decision invalidated the county's severance tax collections between March 8, 1993, and May 31, 1993, was misplaced. That decision did not hold that the Tennessee General Assembly could not enact a private act permitting a particular county to levy a local tax for local purposes. There could not be a successful challenge of the validity of the tax authorized by the General Assembly and levied by the county commission for the period in question. Constitutional requirements of uniformity in taxation did not apply to special legislation authorizing counties to levy taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and maternal grandparents objected to the putative father's petition to establish a parent-child relationship with his alleged daughter under Tenn. Code. Ann. &sect; 36-2-202(c). The statute provided that a putative father could not legitimate a child without the mother's consent. The state attorney general certified to the court his conclusion that the statute was unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed an unmarried woman to prevent a putative father from legitimating his alleged biological child. The court reversed the dismissal of the father's petition. The father was entitled to the custody, companionship, and care of his child and could not be deprived of those rights except by due process of law. The father had a constitutionally protected right to attempt to create a legal parent-child relationship with his natural daughter. The logical avenue through which he may accomplish this was by filing a petition to legitimate his child. The state could not authorize the mother to veto the legitimation process without demonstrating a compelling interest. However, the attorney general had acknowledged that the state failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

The court found that provisions of a county's home rule charter which conflicted with a general law of the state did not supersede the general law, regardless of the fact that those provisions related to matters in which the county acted in a governmental or political capacity. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-2-201(c), pertaining to the eligibility of residents to serve on school boards in counties with populations of 700,000 or more, was general in form and effect, and was not unconstitutional, therefore, local approval of the provision was not required.

A hearing officer recommended denying his parole because of the seriousness of the offense for which he was being held and to continue with aftercare. The Board adopted the recommendation. Affirming, the court determined that the inmate had no right to judicial review of the correctness of the decision. The common law writ of certiorari allowed the review of the Board's actions to determine whether it exceeded its jurisdiction or acted illegally, fraudulently, or arbitrarily. The Board had discretion to decide whether new evidence entitled the inmate to an appeal hearing. The Board was authorized, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-503(b)(2), to deny parole if release would depreciate the seriousness of the offense.

The Department notified the inmate of the process that he had to follow in order to receive an order. Rather than supplying the Department with requested information and contacting his counselor as instructed, the inmate filed the action in the chancery court. The court agreed that the controversy was not ripe for adjudication because the inmate had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.

</DIV>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that Tenn.

Temporary custody was awarded to appellee Department of Human Services. Approximately two and one-half years later, the Juvenile Court for Montgomery County at Clarksville, Tennessee, terminated the parental rights of the parents pursuant to an amended version of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-159. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that application of the amended version of &sect; 37-1-159 violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws and unconstitutionally deprived them of a vested right to a de novo trial in circuit court. The parents also challenged the evidentiary support for the decision. The court affirmed. First, the court held that the parents were afforded a constitutionally adequate hearing in the juvenile court. The parents' reliance on the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws was misplaced because Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, applied exclusively to criminal offenses. Second, the amended version of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 37-1-159(a) did not curtail the parents' appellate rights nor did it come at such an advanced stage of the proceeding that it undermined their substantive rights. The amendment left intact the parents' right to appeal and did not unconstitutionally hinder their ability to present their case in the juvenile court or their ability to seek appellate review of the decision. Third, the evidence demonstrated clearly and convincingly that the child's physical safety and psychological maturation was best served by terminating the parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother appealed the judgment of the Chancery Court of Cheatham County at Ashland City (Tennessee), which granted a petition for contempt by the mother of the visitation provisions of a divorce decree and for enforcement of petitioner grandmother's visitation rights, ordered the mother to pay the grandmother's attorney fees, and denied the mother's counter-petition to terminate the earlier visitation order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the mother's divorce decree, the grandmother was granted visitation privileges in her home with her grandchild. After an incident when the father appeared at the grandmother's home while the child was there, the mother would not permit the child to go to the grandmother's house. The grandmother filed a petition for contempt and for enforcement of the ordered visitation. The mother filed a counter-petition for termination of the ordered visitation. The trial court granted the grandmother's petition, denied the mother's counter-petition, and ordered the mother to pay the grandmother's attorney fees. The mother appealed, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that trial court did not err in holding the mother in contempt because she did not have the right to ignore a lawful court order or to unilaterally change that order. The trial court properly denied the mother's counter-petition because there was no material change of circumstance adequate to justify a change in the original visitation order. The court found that the award of attorney fees was improper because the statute authorizing punishment for contempt did not mention such a sanction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's ruling which granted the grandmother's petition for contempt by the mother of the visitation provisions of a divorce decree and for enforcement of her visitation rights and denial of the mother's counter-petition to terminate the earlier visitation order. The court reversed the trial court's ruling which ordered the mother to pay the grandmother's attorney fees. Costs of the appeal were taxed to the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board renewed six permits for the waste disposal plant's operation after entering into a settlement agreement in which the waste disposal plant agreed to make expensive improvements.

The court reversed and vacated the trial court's affirmance, holding that the reversal was arbitrary and capricious in light of the settlement agreement, which stated that so long as the waste disposal plant was proceeding with its improvements it would be deemed in compliance with the emission control ordinance of Nashville, Tenn. Metropolitan Code &sect; 10.56.170. To abrogate the terms of the agreement before it could be carried out under its terms was not unjust and indecent. The court also held that &sect; 10.56.170 was not unconstitutionally vague; there was no merit to the waste disposal plant's challenge of the application of Nashville, Tenn. Metropolitan Code &sect; 10.56.040(A) to the facts of the case; and the board was authorized to consider the location and surrounding area of the source of pollution in exercising its powers, but the exercise of its powers must be reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The patient and her mother brought an action for medical malpractice, as well as for violation of a state act, which was found to be unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion of the clinic and physician to dismiss the extraneous allegations in the complaint. After discovery, the clinic and physician then brought a motion for summary judgment alleging that they had performed all care in conformance with the recognized standards of acceptable medical practice. The trial court granted their motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision because the patient's appeal was based on the ground that she did not have the capacity to consent to the abortion, which constituted a battery rather than the alleged malpractice. Further, there was no allegation of relief sought. She never amended her complaint to allege failure of consent. The patient failed to rebut the presumption that she was a mature minor having the capacity to consent, and she presented no testimony that she suffered as a proximate cause of negligence.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the state constitution protected the privacy interest of the parents in child rearing decisions so long as their decisions did not substantially endanger the welfare of their children. The court pointed out that the trial court could not engage in a best interest of the child analysis without first determining whether the parents had substantially endangered the welfare of the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first agreed to consider the injured person's argument that the act applied to the unique circumstances of the condominium at issue, notwithstanding that the specific issue had not been raised before the trial court, because the injured person had generally sought to apply the act at trial. The court then held that the act did not apply, despite the fact that many of the condominium units had never been sold by the developer, because the injured person had purchased her condominium unit and continued to own it. The court further held that the act, which distinguished between landlords and tenants on the one hand, and condominium owners and developers on the other hand, was constitutional, because there was a difference between the two relationships, in that a condominium unit owner's responsibilities with regard to the property was much greater than that of a tenant. The court also affirmed the trial court's holding that two municipal ordinances were not applicable to the premises in question, because the court could not take judicial notice of a municipal ordinance, and the injured person had failed to prove the applicability of the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals, in their petition for rehearing, argued that the court failed to take into account a recent decision of the Tennessee Supreme Court wherein the individuals also were the plaintiffs, just as in this action. They also argued that the court was incorrect in stating in its opinion that it was undisputed that none of appellees sold or distributed any asbestos-containing products relevant to this action within the effective date of the original enactment of the TPLA. The court held that the referred to Tennessee Supreme Court decision was not controlling in this case because its focus was on the issue of when a cause of action accrued, a concept that that was immaterial to the issue in this case, the expiration of the statute of repose. The court then concluded that it was incorrect when it stated that the parties were in agreement that all of appellees ceased to manufacture and distribute asbestos-containing products more than 10 years prior to July 1, 1978, the effective date of the TPLA. This was only correct as to one of appellees. Because the record was factually deficient as to the other appellees, this was fatal to their summary judgment motions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petitions for rehearing as to all except one of appellees. The court modified its opinion and judgment so that it found and held that only one manufacturer, who did not manufacture and distribute asbestos-containing products more than 10 years prior to the effective date of the TPLA, was entitled to summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was sentenced to six years in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Correction. He requested the opportunity to serve the sentence in the Cocke County Jail where he could earn sentence reduction credits by engaging in work programs. The request was denied, and the inmate filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, alleging that his equal protection rights were violated by the unequal treatment in his ability to earn sentence reduction credits. The trial court found that the inmate had no constitutional right to receive the credits nor a constitutional right to serve his sentence at any particular place, and the trial court dismissed the action. The inmate appealed, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the inmate's complaint failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. His demand for equal opportunity for sentence credits was inextricably included in the assignment to a place of incarceration. However, the inmate had no constitutional right to incarceration in a particular institution. Nor did he have a constitutional right to receive sentence credits.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-3-104 (Supp. 1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were injured in an accident involving a van owned by the corporation and brought an action against the driver and the corporation's owner. An amended complaint was filed adding the corporation as a defendant. The victims voluntarily dismissed the action and filed another action against all three defendants. The trial court dismissed the second action. On appeal, the court noted that if the amendment in the first action related back to the initial filing date under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 15.03, the voluntary dismissal of the action allowed the victims one year within which to institute a new action against the corporation and the second action was timely filed. For R. 15.03 to apply, it was essential for the corporation to have notice of the lawsuit within the statutory period. The corporation did not have such notice, and the court held that its notice of the accident was immaterial. The court also held that the doctrine of estoppel could not be invoked to preclude the corporation from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense. The court did not entertain the victims' argument that R. 15.03 violated equal protection, as the issue was not raised in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured worked as a carpenter and claimed employment-related exposure to products containing asbestos that were manufactured and/or sold by the manufacturers. It was undisputed that none of the manufacturers sold or distributed any asbestos-containing products within 10 years of the effective date of the original enactment of the TPLA. However, within one year of the date he discovered that he was suffering from an asbestos-related lung disease, he filed an action. The circuit court held that his action was time-barred. The court affirmed and held that the 10-year period established by &sect; 29-28-103(a) was a statute of repose and thus, barred the injured's action on the date the TPLA became effective. Further, the asbestos exception could not be applied retroactively to revive the injured's already-barred cause of action and the decision to classify asbestos-related claims differently from other latent-injury claims was not so patently arbitrary as lacking any rational basis and thus, did not offend Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of a brutal rape, and the conviction was affirmed on appeal.

After exhausting his administrative appeals, the inmate filed a petition for common-law writ of certiorari, which was dismissed. The court affirmed the dismissal. First, the Board's motion under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12.02(1) was in error and the court construed it as a motion under Rule 12.02(6); that is, the issue was not jurisdictional. Rather, it went to the sufficiency of the complaint. A common-law writ of certiorari permitted a court to review the manner in which the Board reached its decision but not to review the intrinsic correctness of the decision itself. The inmate challenged the decision only. He did not contend that the Board's decision was beyond its jurisdiction or that it was illegal, fraudulent, or arbitrary. The inmate's challenge to the individual Board member's comment failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Last, inmates in Tennessee did not have a protected liberty interest in being paroled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was employed by the board until he was discharged for cause. After his discharge, the teacher worked as a substitute and performed satisfactorily. A board policy prohibited the rehiring of any employee who was discharged for cause, inefficiency, or immorality. Thus, when the teacher reapplied for full-time employment, his application was denied. The teacher filed an action alleging that appellees' refusal to consider him for a position violated his due process and equal protection rights. The trial court declared that the policy was invalid but that the teacher did not prove that he would have been hired in the absence of the policy. The teacher appealed, and the court affirmed the holding that the policy was invalid but vacated the rest of the judgment. Although the teacher did not have a protected property interest in being employed by the board, he had a protected liberty interest in pursuing his chosen occupation. The evidence showed that the board relied on the unconstitutional policy, that the teacher's constitutionally protected liberty interest in pursuing his chosen profession was infringed, and that he was entitled to but was denied procedural due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that portion of the judgment of the trial court finding the board's policy unconstitutional.

The construction and application of the grandfather clause contained in 1982 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 295, &sect; 2 was dispositive of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers had acquired tenure as teachers when 1982 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 295, which permitted the school superintendent to replace a supervisory employee by changing the employee to a teaching position, became effective. A grandfather clause in 1982 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 295, &sect; 2 provided that the replacement provision did not apply to supervisors who were tenured when the law became effective. The teachers later were transferred to positions as supervisors, but they were eventually transferred back to the classroom as teachers. The teachers brought an action against the County and the Board. The trial court determined that the teachers were entitled to tenure as supervisors under 1949 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 384, &sect;&sect; 1-2 and that they were entitled to supervisors' benefits and to back pay for the differential in salaries. The court stated that a grandfather clause had to be construed strictly against a party who sought to come within the exception. The grandfather clause contained in 1982 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 295, &sect; 2 applied only to those who had attained tenure as supervisors in 1982. The teachers did not fall within the clause because they were not tenured supervisors in 1982.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Davidson County Chancery Court at Nashville (Tennessee), which held that the Unfair Cigarette Sales Law, Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the Unfair Cigarette Sales Law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 47-25-303, which prohibited selling cigarettes below cost with intent to injure competitors or destroy competition, was unconstitutional because it violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1-7. Appellee argued that the statute was immune from attack under the Parker state action doctrine because the legislature itself created the anticompetitive scheme. The court noted that the state could not give antitrust immunity to an agency by allowing them to fix prices, but found that such exception to Parker immunity did not apply where the legislature created the scheme. The court also found that the portion of the statute making evidence of below cost sales prima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors did not violate due process because it gave rise to a permissive inference rather than a mandatory presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties submitted to a blood test, and the results established that appellant had a 99.65 percent probability of being the child's father. The trial court granted the wife's motion for summary judgment, relying on the blood test and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 27-7-112(b)(2) (amended 1994), which established a conclusive presumption of paternity where the probability of paternity was 99 percent or greater. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in its retrospective application of amended &sect; 27-7-112(b)(2) and that the application of amended &sect; 27-7-112(b)(2) violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed, holding that the mother was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the retrospective application of amended &sect; 27-7-112(b)(2) was proper where it was procedural in nature. The conclusive presumption of paternity, where the probability of paternity was 99 percent or greater, merely expedited the resolution of paternity disputes. The father's constitutional challenge was not reviewed because he did not give notice to the Tennessee State Attorney General as required under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 24.04 and Tenn. R. App. P. 32.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer collected sales tax on extended warranty contracts purchased by its customers and remitted those taxes to the Commissioner. It filed a claim for refund of the taxes collected and remitted during a given year. The claim was denied by the Commissioner because it was not timely filed. Under ch. 80, &sect; 3, 1991 Tenn. Pub. Acts, no sales tax paid prior to the date of the statute could be refunded unless filed within 30 days after the effective date of the enactment of the statute. The provision applied notwithstanding the fact that under the refund statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-1802, claims for the refund of taxes collected could be filed within three years. The trial court ruled that the shortened period was unreasonable and, therefore, was a denial of due process. The Commissioner appealed, and the court upheld the judgment. The court ruled that the lack of notice arose from the fact that the 30-day limitation was never codified and was never included in &sect; 67-1-1802. Further, the court held that, although the enactment of ch. 80, &sect; 3, 1991 Tenn. Pub. Acts did not eliminate the post-deprivation procedure for refunds, it was so inhibitive that it accomplished that objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two cities filed an action against the county and its clerk seeking an injunction against the county's collection of a landfill tax authorized by 1991 Tenn.

Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8. The environmental service, the casket company, and the iron company intervened in the action. The trial court entered partial summary judgment that 1991 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 52 was constitutional, and then dismissed the action. Appellants sought review and argued that 1991 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 52 was in conflict with the general state law, and that the privilege tax was arbitrary, capricious, and wholly unreasonable, and thereby unenforceable. The court found that there was no showing that 1991 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 52 encroached upon the provisions of the general law, and that there was no ground for holding the Act unconstitutional. The court also found that the privilege tax was not in conflict with state mandated fees because the tax and the fees were not the same.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the argument of the paternal grandparent and affirmed the trial court's decision. The court noted that the paternal grandmother's petition sought to contravene the mother's decision to restrict visitation between her children and the paternal grandmother, which was a direct challenge to the fundamental privacy interest of the mother. The court noted that the paternal grandmother did not allege that a substantial danger of harm had threatened the children or, that the mother was not a fit parent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a high school principal, appealed the judgment of the Chancery Court of Sumner County at Gallatin (Tennessee), which dismissed his complaint against defendant civil liberties group. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-14-101 et seq. to declare constitutional a state statute authorizing prayer at graduation ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The civil liberties group had written a letter to the principal warning him that if he permitted prayer at graduation ceremonies, the group might bring a legal action against him if requested by parents or students at the school. The principal filed this action against the civil liberties group seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the statute permitting prayer, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-6-1004(c). On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal, holding that neither party had the requisite interest to justify a declaratory judgment. A declaratory judgment under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-14-103 required: (1) a real, not theoretical question; (2) a real interest in the person seeking the declaration; and (3) a real interest in the party opposing the declaratory judgment. The court noted that the statute in question did not require the principal to take any action or to refrain from any action.

Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-1701-Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-1708 (1994) (the Act). He claimed that the tax was unconstitutional. The refund claim was denied. The Chancery Court of Shelby County (Tennessee) granted summary judgment to the State. The attorney sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney practiced in the State. He objected to the payment of a privilege tax because it violated the separation of powers established in Tenn. Const. art. II and the grant of judicial power in Tenn. Const. art. IV. He claimed it was an invasion by the Legislature into the role, domain, and function of the judicial branch of the government. Upon review, the court found that the Act specifically provided that the tax was not a regulatory fee under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-4-1705. The failure to pay the tax was not grounds for discipline. The court held that a license to practice law issued by the State did not grant immunity to attorneys from the privilege tax. There was nothing in the Act that conflicted with the authority of the Supreme Court of Tennessee to control the bar. The practice of law was a privilege granted by an issuance of a license from the Supreme Court. The State Legislature had the power to tax attorneys for that privilege under Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28(c). There was no reason the practice of law should not have been subject to a privilege tax like other occupations.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 48-3-501 et seq., to be unconstitutional and violative of the Equal Protection Clauses of both the United States and Tennessee Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the Act impermissibly discriminated against professional solicitors. In partially affirming and partially reversing, the court held that Tenn.

The court determined that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 48-3-513(m), which prohibited charities and professional solicitors not complying with the requirements of the Act from engaging in charitable solicitations, was constitutional because it was merely an enforcement provision and applied to charities and professional solicitors alike. The court also found the exemptions under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 48-3-502(a)(1), (3) for certain organizations from the Act's application did not violate equal protection because they were not similarly situated to charitable organizations governed under the Act. Finally, the court held that the Act did not violate free speech protections because it was narrowly tailored to withstand First Amendment scrutiny and did not serve as a prior restraint on speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers furnished long distance telephone connections between local exchanges. They competed for the patronage of the local telephone subscribers who designated their choice among available long distance providers. The providers were compensated by billing the local customer through the local exchange. Some intra-county telephone calls in certain counties required the long distance connection between local exchanges. The Commission adopted a policy of eliminating long distance telephone calls within a single county. The Commission claimed it had the power under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 65-5-201 to distribute the load of the utility costs by lowering rates charged to one class of customers because of the profits it derived from another class of customers. Upon review, the court found that the Commission did not have that authority. The order of the Commission was a taking, not for public use, but for private use of an individual at the individual's demand. Under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, the providers were entitled to just compensation for that taking. Thus, the Commission's order was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that although the prohibition against sale of beer on Sunday was rooted exclusively in religion, the prohibition had taken on a secular meaning and did not run afoul of Tenn. Const. art. I., &sect; 3. The appellate court also rejected the store owner's arguments that the beer board's decision violated the due process clause of the Tennessee Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney refused to pay his occupational privilege tax to TDR. The attorney alleged that the grant of a license to practice law was a contract, and that his contract obligations were impaired by the tax. The attorney also claimed that the tax deprived him of the guarantees of equal protection. On appeal, the court held that granting a license to practice law did not create a binding contract between the attorney and the State. The court noted that there was no reason to determine that a license to practice law was a contract while a license to practice medicine was not. The court found that in order for the attorney's equal protection argument to have succeeded, he had to establish that there was no legitimate state interest in treating different professionals differently. The court rejected the attorney's argument that physicians, photographers, and school teachers were so similarly circumstanced that the legislature could not tax them differently without risking a lawsuit claiming a violation of equal protection. Further, the court ruled that there were reasonable bases for the legislature to classify different professionals differently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tennessee Valley Authority, which established above-ground transmission towers on an easement from an earlier condemnation proceeding, was willing to run cable jointly with the telephone company, which decided instead to install underground, which the landowners contended exceeded public necessity. On review, the court found no fraud, bad faith, or gross abuse of discretion in the telephone company's condemnation proceeding. The court asserted that the telephone company had a legitimate technological reason for the underground installation, and once the cable was buried, it would be less intrusive, not visibly interfering with using and enjoying the land and requiring less maintenance. The court observed that the tower easement included rights to lay foundations, obviously extending them downward into the land to some depth, similar to underground cable. The court found the landowners' statutory construction overly narrow and contrary to legislative intent delegating eminent domain power to telecommunications companies and utilizing the statute as technology developed. The court found the statute rationally related to a conceivable public purpose and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Board bore the burden of justifying its restriction on commercial speech. There was no evidence that any actual person was misled or harmed by the dentist's advertisement. The Board failed to take administrative knowledge, under Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county opened a landfill in which residents and cities could deposit solid wastes. The county charged fees to persons and entities using the landfill. The cities brought an action against the county seeking a declaratory judgment that the fee was an unconstitutional tax-shifting device that imposed a heavier tax burden on city residents than on county residents. The mayors of the cities intervened in the action as individual property owners and taxpayers. After a bench trial, the chancery court entered judgment in favor of the county. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that (1) the mayors and one city did not file a timely notice of appeal identifying themselves as parties as required by Tenn. R. App. P. 3(f) and were not properly before the court; (2) the cities were exempt from the county's taxes and lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the fees under Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 28 and the Equal Protection Clause; (3) Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-19-103 permitted the county to open the landfill without a single resolution defining its program; and (4) the fee was not a tax because residents could avoid it by refraining from using the landfill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and remanded the judgment dismissing the cities' action for an injunction prohibiting the county from charging fees for the use of its landfill.

The trial court held that the Utility District did not comply with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-82-302(g) by agreeing with nearby municipalities to supply water or notifying them of its intent to serve the area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Utility District argued that the trial court erred in failing to award it possession of the property after appellees did not question its right to take within five days. It contended that the trial court erred in holding that it did not comply with the service provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-82-302(g). The court agreed that the trial court should have given a writ of possession when there was no defect in the service process. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-82-305 gave the Utility District the power of eminent domain to supply water within its district. It was to follow the procedures set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-17-801 et seq. and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-82-301. The condemnation petition met all the formal statutory requirements. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-82-302(g) gave municipalities the prior right to extend water utilities into an area within three or five miles of their corporate limits. The benefits of the statute only inured to the benefit of the municipalities that were within the specified area and not to an individual. Appellees lacked standing to use as a defense a statute that dealt with corporate powers. The court remanded for an order of immediate possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City undertook to acquire land to construct a public golf course. The City selected a Texas firm to design and construct the course. The City also decided to issue capital outlay notes to finance the project. The City and the firm were to enter into a land lease agreement providing that the firm was to lease a portion of land where it was to construct, operate, and maintain certain practice facilities. The facilities were to be open to the public and turned over to the City upon expiration of the lease term. The City granted the firm an option to purchase certain remaining portions of land. The court concluded that the state constitution and statutes did not proscribe the proposed agreements and that they fell within the ambit of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-21-107. The issuance of the notes was not an unconstitutional lending of the City's credit to the firm. The proceeds of the notes were to have been used to finance the construction of the course only, which the City would have owned and operated upon completion. Nor had the City entered into an implied partnership arrangement with the firm amounting to an unconstitutional lending of the City's credit to the firm.</SPAN></P>

It found that the population classification section violated the privileges and immunities clause, Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8 because it acted an as impermissible suspension of general law. The court also found that the population classifications violated the equal protection clause in Tenn. Const. Art. 1, &sect; 8 because the classifications lacked a rational basis.

The trial court reviewed the administrative interlocutory order and considered the supplemental record, which the court held that the review of the extraneous evidence was admissible in support of a defense of res judicata or judicial estoppel. The court held that practicing dentistry and operating a dental clinic are crimes under the laws of Tennessee, for violation of which the board is not qualified to determine guilt or punishment. The court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-1-134 authorized any board attached to the &quot;division of health related boards&quot; to assess a civil penalty for each violation of a &quot;statute, rule, or order pertaining to such board.&quot; The application of that provision to acts otherwise declared to be state criminal offenses would have been unconstitutional.

The ward claimed the laws violated his due process and equal protection rights. The trial court dissolved the conservatorship and found the laws constitutional. On appeal, the court held that the laws at issue provided extensive procedural safeguards at the time of the conservator's appointment and that wards had unlimited rights to meaningful review hearings at which they may prove regained capability. Because the ward could contact a court or file a petition, the laws did not restrict the ward's liberty on the ground of substantive due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The architect sought to remodel a building located in Wilson County. Thereafter, the architect received a stop work order from the state fire marshall and an order from the board to cease the unlicensed practice of architecture and engineering. The architect responded by filing a declaratory judgment action whereby he sought injunctive relief to allow him to finish the remodeling. The commissioner and the board responded with a motion to dismiss for improper venue. The motion was granted, and the architect appealed the order. The architect argued that venue was proper in the county where the property was located according to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-4-107. The court noted, however, that a lawsuit brought against a state officer in his or her official capacity, such as the commissioner and the board, must have been brought in the county of the officer's official residence. Therefore, venue was improper in Wilson County, and the motion was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, plaintiff inmate one sought review of a judgment from the Chancery Court for Davidson County, at Nashville (Tennessee) that denied his cross-motion for summary judgment and dismissed his action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief with regard to an increase in his release eligibility date (RED). Plaintiff inmate two challenged the dismissal of his action for review of the revocation of his parole eligibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both inmates had previously entered a guilty plea to the disciplinary offense of escape. They argued that the extension of their REDs violated their due process and equal protection rights. Affirming the dismissal of their actions, the court stated that the REDs were extended pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-501(i) and Tennessee Department of Corrections (TDOC) policy number 502.02, which provided for the extension of an inmate's RED for violations of certain disciplinary rules. The TDOC policy was not a rule within the meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 4-5-102(10) in that the policy addressed internal management of the TDOC and did not affect the rights of the public at large. The trial court properly dismissed the inmates' petitions and held that they were not entitled to a declaratory judgment as a matter of law. The court stated that the inmates' petitions failed to allege any due process right violation. Further, no violation of the inmates' equal protection rights was found as the challenged policy was closely related to a legitimate state interest in preventing the escape of inmates, and there was no showing of any arbitrary discrimination against any class of inmates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments and remanded the cases for any further proceedings that may have been necessary.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner therefore denied the request for a hearing. In affirming the trial court's decision to affirm the Commissioner, the court held that because the owner's petition was not received on time, and because the owner did not file either a bond or a pauper's oath as required by &sect; 53-11-201(c), the Commissioner properly denied the owner's request for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual had been drinking. His uncle prevented him from leaving and an altercation ensued. The individual's mother called the police. The officers entered the premises and gave the individual the choice of going home with his uncle, staying at the apartment with his uncle, or going to jail. He left with his uncle. En route, he jumped out of the vehicle. The officers found him and arrested him for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. He was found guilty. The individual contended that the officers unlawfully searched his home, evicted him from his home, and arrested him. Upon review, the court found that the city was immune from liability on the state law claims. The court found that the record was devoid of any evidence suggesting a policy or custom of the police to ask citizens to leave town. The court found that considering the individual's actions, the officers acted reasonably under the circumstances and did not violate his rights as a matter of law. Under Tenn.

On appeal, the court held that: (1) Tenn.

The property owners and others had operated an adult book and video store at their location since the early 1970's. In 1977, the City amended its zoning ordinance to add new regulations that governed adult-oriented establishments. Under the amendment, the property was no longer zoned for an adult-oriented establishment, but such a use there was permitted as a pre-existing non-confirming use under the grandfather provision of the ordinance. In 1987 the attorney general filed a suit against the property owners that sought to abate the public nuisance. The criminal court issued a temporary injunction that restrained the property owners from continuing the operation. The city then took the position that the property owners had abandoned their business and were no longer grandfathered in. The court affirmed the lower court and held that the zoning ordinance was held to a strict construction. The court held that the term abandoned did not apply to involuntary closing of the business by the criminal court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the statutes at issue dealt with the imprisonment of persons convicted of the offense of driving while intoxicated. The county asserted that the mandatory imposition of minimum jail sentences had placed a heavy burden of expense upon the county to feed and house the prisoners, which additional expense the State was obligated to share by Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 24. The State contended that the legislature made statutory provision for the State's sharing of the increased expense of keeping prisoners and that the amount of such provision was a legislative matter and not subject to judicial review. The court agreed with the State and affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that the legislature was constitutionally empowered to elect what the share of the State would be in the subject expenses. The share enacted by the legislature was substantial and was not an ineffective compliance with the constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of aggravated rape. He was sentenced to life as a habitual offender under Tenn.

The Board notified the inmate that a proposed amendment to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-602(a) would prohibit the Board from reviewing the sentences of offenders whose triggering offense was an crime against the person. The proposed amendment did not pass and the Board decided not to consider granting the inmate a new release eligibility date. The inmate argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The inmate also argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-602 was unconstitutional because it created a class of offenders to whom a new release eligibility date was not available. The court dismissed the inmate's constitutional claims as meritless because he merely alleged the Board made a mistake in not granting him a release eligibility date. The court held that Tenn.

The trial court dismissed the action and held that it did not have jurisdiction to determine parole eligibility or the length of an inmate's sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-501(i) authorized the Board to determine in its discretion which inmates were to receive a new &quot;release eligibility date&quot; for parole. Also, the court found that the inmate waived the issues of the denial of due process and unreasonable classifications under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was adjacent to an airport. As a pilot, the owner sought to run his aviation business by directly accessing the airport. The owner's request to operate from his property to the airport through a fence was denied by the board, as was his request to donate and lease the property back. The claimant filed an action for declaratory relief. The lower court granted summary judgment to the board. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the board's action was not wide of any reasonable remark. Rather, the uncontroverted facts showed that the board rejected the owner's offer to donate his property for safety reasons. Thus, no constitutional violation occurred. Nor did the board act illegally, arbitrarily, or capriciously. Thus, the court was precluded from substituting its judgment for that of the board. To hold otherwise was to infringe on the authority of local government entities.</SPAN></P>

The actions were consolidated for trial, and the trial court granted summary judgment to the representatives, holding that the Board's promulgation of Rule 0660-6-.01 exceeded its legislative authority. The Board appealed. The representatives contended that the Board's promulgation of Rule 0660-6-.01 was an unlawful attempt to legislate. The court observed that an administrative agency's rules or regulations could not be inconsistent with a constitutional provision or other law on the subject, nor could the rules affect or create a substantive right. The court held the Board's attempt to define the phrase &quot;under the direction and supervision&quot; to be an impermissible alteration or enlargement of the legislature's enactment of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party filed a negligence action against defendant restaurant. The restaurant filed a third-party complaint against third-party defendant stool manufacturer and retailer. The manufacturer and retailer sought interlocutory review of a decision of the Second Circuit Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which denied their motions to dismiss, and which granted leave to the injured party to amend his complaint to include them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A stool on which the injured party was sitting while in the restaurant collapsed, injuring him. The stool manufacturer and retailer contended that the McIntyre decision announcing the rule of comparative negligence required reversal of the trial court's decision denying their motions to dismiss because the type of indemnity or contribution sought by the restaurant was abolished by the decision. The court, affirming in part and reversing in part, held that the third-party complaint did not state an action under the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tort Feasors Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-11-101-106 (1980), because pursuant to McIntyre, the rule of pro-rata distribution of liability among joint tortfeasors was defunct. However, the court also held the additional allegation of the third-party complaint for breach of implied warranty or indemnity was not properly subject to a motion to dismiss. With regard to the second appeal the court reversed the trial court's order after it concluded that using Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-1-119 to revive an action that was already time-barred, as were the injured party's claims against the manufacturer and retailer, violated Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

The existence of a possible alternate remedy did not deprive the homeowners of the right to pursue their constitutional protections under the procedures outlined in the inverse condemnation statute,&nbsp;Tenn.

The commissioner argued that the apportionment had to be based on treating the corporations as separate entities. The commissioner had denied the corporations' petition for a variance because there was no evidence to support a combined reporting. The court affirmed the chancery court's judgment that denied the corporations a tax refund. The court held that &sect; 67-4-811 was unambiguous, and its apportionment provision was not designed for a unitary group. There was nothing in &sect; 67-4-811 that required the commissioner to adopt an alternative formula. The evidence showed that the apportionment formula fairly related to the corporations' business activity in the state, and the corporations failed to meet the burden required to justify departure from the normal formula.</SPAN></P>

The Chancery Court for Hamblen County (Tennessee) granted respondents' motion for summary judgment and denied the applicant's motion. It dismissed the petition for certiorari.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The application was denied despite the fact that the applicant had complied with Tenn.

The board did not give a reason for the denial, but after the applicant filed his action for a writ of certiorari, the county amended its zoning ordinance to state that beer sales would not be permitted within 300 feet of a residence provided that the resident appeared before the board and objected. The court stated that under &sect; 57-5-105, a beer board had to issue a license to anyone who met the requirements of the statute. It could not prescribe conditions for the issuance of a permit in addition to those set out in the statute. Next, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that the amendment of the ordinance to include the &quot;300 foot rule&quot; was grounds for denial of the permit. In a proceeding for review under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-5-109(d), statutory law at the time of the commission of the act applied, and the trial court erred in applying the rule retroactively because it was not only procedurally remedial in nature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee operators filed separate actions seeking to have an ordinance of appellant city invalidated. The actions were heard together, and the city filed a motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court of Sevier County (Tennessee), sua sponte, entered judgment in favor of the operators and declared Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-208(f)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The city appealed, and the actions were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operators provided helicopter services on a commercial basis. After annexation in 1977 and 1978, the operators were permitted to operate their respective helicopter businesses as a pre-existing nonconforming use under the city's zoning ordinance. Subsequently, the city enacted City of Pigeon Forge, Tenn., Ordinance 411, which prohibited any existing helicopter operation to land or take off from land within the corporate limits of the city by a certain date. The operators filed their actions in response. The trial court, sua sponte, ruled Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 13-7-208(f) was unconstitutional, and thus City of Pigeon Forge, Tenn., Ordinance 411 was invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed the action invalidating the Ordinance 411, but pretermitted the constitutional issue because the failure of the city to submit Ordinance 411 to the planning commission rendered it fatally defective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment entered in favor of the operators, taxed costs to the city, and remanded the action to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City enacted the ordinance prohibiting the sale of alcohol in strip clubs. The strip club contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it failed to follow the procedures set forth in the City's charter regarding the enactment of amendments to legislation. The trial court found in favor of the strip club, and the City sought review. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-20-214, no ordinance was to be amended except by a new ordinance. However, the court found that an ordinance did not become an ordinance until after its third reading. The court determined that what constituted a material or substantial change in an ordinance between the date of its first and final reading was dependent upon the circumstances of each case. The court held that, if nothing new was added to the ordinance or if what was taken had not rendered it misleading in its fundamental concept, the alteration was not material as to characterize the ordinance different from the previous reading. The court held that the ordinance had not been materially changed between readings. The court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The special judge brought a successful action for mandamus to compel the county to compensate him for replacing the disabled incumbent judge. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment for the special judge and found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-2-116, which authorized the governor to appoint temporary general sessions court judges, was constitutional. In addition, the county had a statutory obligation to pay the judge's salary because Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-2-117(a) (1980) provided that special judges drew the same salary as the regular judge. Even though the statutes did not specifically assign responsibility for paying the salary, the court found that the county was responsible because state law required it to fund the entire operation of its general sessions courts, including the judge's salary. Making financial provisions to replace a disabled general sessions judge was a necessary and foreseeable part of the county's operation of that court. Mandamus was a proper remedy because the judge had no other specific or adequate remedy. The county did not meet its burden of proving that the judge was not properly serving as a special general sessions court judge.</SPAN></P>

The husband appealed, asserting that Rule 15(g) violated both the state and federal constitutions. The court reversed the judgment, holding that Rule 15(g) did violate the separation of powers doctrine as provided in Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 and 2. The court held that the function of court rules was to regulate practice of the trial court and facilitate the transaction of its business, but no court rule could enlarge or restrict jurisdiction or abrogate or modify substantive law. The court noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-4-101-104 (1991) authorized the judiciary to grant divorces for cause which the legislature specifically stated within the statute, and Rule 15(g) improperly modified the substantive law enacted by the legislature by requiring or conditioning the parties' right to a divorce on their submission to counseling.</SPAN></P>

The chief alleged, among other things, that the administrator was not authorized under the city charter to discharge him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief was terminated by the administrator for failing to stay at a town square demonstration. The board affirmed the administrator's action, and the chief filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the lower court. The lower court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed as modified and remanded. The court held that under the city's charter the administrator did not have the power to terminate the chief, because the chief was not a city employee but an officer who could only be terminated by the board. However, the administrator's act was ratified by the later actions of the board, which provided the chief with notice and a hearing before affirming the administrator's decision. Although there was sufficient evidence of the board's bias, under the &quot;rule of necessity&quot; the members were not required to recuse themselves because the board was the only agency authorized to make a decision as to the chief's employment. Under a heightened standard of review, the court found that an objective decisionmaker would have reached the same conclusion as the board. Because the chief was entitled to back pay, the action was remanded to assess the proper amount of compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was elected to his office as judge of the general sessions court. At the time, the general sessions court did not exercise jurisdiction over domestic relations matters. Years later, while the judge was still in office, the general sessions court was granted jurisdiction over domestic relations matters pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-3-601 (1991). The State on behalf of the judge brought an action against defendants to recover an annual salary supplement to which he was allegedly entitled under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-15-5003(d)(1)(C) (Supp. 1992) as a result of the added domestic relations jurisdiction. Defendants argued that the general sessions court did not have such jurisdiction. The trial court entered judgment for the judge, and defendants appealed. The court held that based on a review of the language of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-3-601, it was clear that &sect; 36-2-601 conferred upon the general sessions court jurisdiction to hear domestic relations cases. The court further found that the judge had exercised domestic relations jurisdiction. Thus, he was entitled to the annual salary supplement under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 16-15-5003(d)(1)(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order entering judgment for the State on behalf of the judge and remanded for the implementation of the trial court's judgment, for the collection of costs assessed to defendants, and for any further necessary proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Sumnar County (Tennessee) granted the woman's motion to set aside a summary judgment that it previously rendered in favor of the distributor. The distributor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The woman filed her suit more than 11 years after the initial implant. The distributor filed its motion for summary judgment, asserting that the applicable statutes of limitations barred the woman's causes of action. The trial court initially granted the motion without specifying the grounds and then granted the woman's motion to set aside the summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the woman had not met her burden of proof in order to obtain relief under Tenn. R. Civ. P. 60.02(2). Specifically, she failed to show how the distributor's alleged fraudulent conduct, namely its alleged fraudulent concealment about the unreasonable safety risks posed by breast implants, prevented her from timely filing her suit. It was arguable that there may have been grounds for tolling the statute had they been properly raised. However, it was likewise incumbent upon the woman to have raised the issue in a timely manner. In that regard, the record did not show that the woman was misled by the distributor's alleged wrongful acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff relator, a general sessions judge, requested a writ of mandamus requiring defendants, a county executive and county commissioners, to resume paying a monthly expense allowance that was authorized under 1983 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 79. The Circuit Court of Sequatchie County (Tennessee) held that the law was unconstitutional, that the doctrine of elision did not apply, and that defendants were not to be reimbursed for amounts already paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The monthly allowance was paid to plaintiff by a separate check. Plaintiff was not required to document his expenses. The trial court held that the payment was really an increase in salary and was prohibited by Tenn. Const. art. 6, &sect; 7. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded. It reasoned that an act's constitutionality depended on the ultimate end that the legislature intended the act to accomplish. 1983 Tenn. Priv. Acts, ch. 79 provided for the payment of a fixed sum without regard to a judge's actual expenses and was an unconstitutional increase in pay during the term of plaintiff's office. The doctrine of elision applied to save the statute because from the face of the act it appeared that the legislature would have enacted it even if it had known of a raise that was planned for five years later. The doctrine made the statute valid until the legislature provided otherwise and plaintiff was entitled to future monthly payments. Plaintiff was required to reimburse defendants for past monthly allowances because plaintiff did not act in good faith in receiving the supplement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of mandamus. It affirmed in part and held that the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed in part and held that the doctrine of elision applied to save statute and that plaintiff was entitled to monthly payments. It ordered that plaintiff reimburse defendants for past payments and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle driver filed a third-party complaint against the bar owner after settling the underlying personal injury suit. The bar owner sought to dismiss the action, claiming that the driver had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because joint and several liability along with the remedy of contribution as set out under the Act was eliminated or abolished by a recent Tennessee Supreme Court decision. On appeal, the court held that as a result of that decision, the Act had not been totally abolished, repealed, or found to be unconstitutional. Second, the principles set out in the decision were to be applied prospectively. Third, the court held that upon remand the vehicle driver's third-party claim against the bar owner was to be tried and determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act as written and in accordance with legal principles that existed prior to the decision.</SPAN></P>

He answered and counter-claimed seeking to legitimate the child. Several months later, the adoptive parents filed a petition seeking adoption of the child, a declaration of abandonment, and termination of the parental rights of the father. The father counter-petitioned for legitimation and custody. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the adoption and then dismissing the father's petition. The trial court should have ruled on the pending petition for legitimation prior to ruling on the petition for adoption. The father complied with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-111(b)(3) by registering his notice of intent to claim paternity with the Putative Father Registry.

The trial court found that the action was time-barred by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-28-103 of the Tennessee Products Liability Act of 1978 (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than 10 years after they constructed a motel, the motel owners discovered that the wood products used in the roof had failed. They filed an action against the wood product sellers alleging negligence, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraudulent misrepresentation, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. The trial court granted the sellers' motions for summary judgment, holding that the action was time-barred by &sect; 29-28-103 of the Act. The motel owners appealed and the court affirmed. The action fell within the definition of products liability contained in the Act at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-28-102(6) and was therefore barred by the 10-year limitations period. The motel owners had no standing for their claim that the limitations period was unconstitutional for failure to include a savings clause, but even if they did, it was rationally related to the reasonable goal of limiting the time period of liability to allow for reasonable calculation of insurance premiums. Fraudulent concealment did not toll the limitations period because the motel owners did not allege that the sellers knew of their product's defective nature or of potential problems at the motel.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment below, ruling that under the statutory scheme the use tax was due on the full cost of the items the taxpayer imported into the state and used there. There also was no statutory exception for a de minimus presence. The court also rejected the taxpayer's claim that it was an autonomous operation. The taxpayer used state roads, shopped in state stores, bought advertising space in state newspapers, and was entitled to police and fire protection. The tax was valid because the taxpayer had a substantial nexus within the state, credits were given for duplicative out-of-state payments, all taxpayers were subject to the same taxes, and the tax was reasonably related to the services provided by the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's complaint stated that &quot;good time laws&quot; were intended to be cumulative, so that inmates should not have been required to waive benefits under former laws in order to qualify for benefits under subsequent laws. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 41-21-236(f)(3) stated that in no event could an inmate receive credits cumulatively under both systems or have received credits at a rate that was less than that provided by the section for felons. That statute was interpreted to prevent &quot;stacking&quot; good time credits provided by successive statutes. The trial judge correctly found as a fact that the inmate had received all the credits to which he was entitled. The court also held that the motion of the Department was properly a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted. Except for the &quot;back credits&quot; that were granted to the inmate, the complaint stated no claim for which relief could have been granted, and was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on a work release program, the inmate committed a felony to which he pleaded guilty. Pursuant to &sect; 40-28-23(b)(1), his parole eligibility was revoked. On appeal of the granting of the State's motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment action, the court noted that the inmate received procedural due process in the proceeding wherein he was convicted of a felony. The remainder was mandated by the statute, and the inmate pointed out no advantage that could have accrued to him through some empty compliance with due process where no issues were available to be raised and resolved. The inmate did not deny his conviction or challenge the revocation of his work release. His only complaint was the alteration of his parole eligibility date. As to the process of recomputing the time of discharge, the inmate had the adequate relief of the Administrative Procedure Act and judicial review of the decision. Though the inmate asserted his right to the advice of counsel before signing a document leading to his work release, the result of sustaining the complaint would have been the invalidation of the document, which was not required by statute or indispensable to the validity of the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The constables filed an action to review a 1991 amendment to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-10-101, which abolished the office of constable in counties with a population between 77,700 and 77,800 people. The constables claimed that the amendment singled out their county in violation of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, which prohibited special legislation. The chancellor entered a judgment holding that the amendment was constitutional. Affirming and remanding, the court found that the amendment did not violate &sect; 8 because there was no general mandatory law or uniform state policy that the challenged amendment contravened. The constables alleged only that the amendment was unconstitutional without pointing to a statute that had been violated by the amendment's terms. The argument that the amendment applied solely to their county was not entirely accurate because other counties could subsequently fall within the population limits of the amendment. The statute as a whole was a &quot;crazy guilt of differing provisions&quot; on the existence and tenure of constables throughout Tennessee. There was no general &quot;rule,&quot; only exceptions applying to various counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner and a female passenger were in his automobile parked in the lot of a night club. The police officers noticed the automobile's occupants were in an argument. When the officer knocked on the window, the owner opened the door and the officer saw a whiskey bottle. The owner produced his license and consented to a search of the automobile. The officer found cocaine in a compartment in the driver's door and arrested the owner. The trial court affirmed the commissioner's decision to forfeit the automobile. On appeal, the court held that drugs previously discovered in other vehicles in the same parking lot did not constitute probable cause for the actions of the officers. The court noted that the owner's automobile was legally parked on private property and that there was no reason for the officer to intervene in a non-violent argument of its occupants. Because the &quot;stop and search&quot; was without reasonable suspicion, the fruits of the search were inadmissible and the forfeiture was unsupported.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mother told the father that she was pregnant, the father broke off their relationship and had no communications with her. The mother than moved in with another man whom she later married after the birth of her son. The other man was listed as the father on the birth certificate. After the mother divorced the other man, she filed her paternity petition against the father. A blood test indicated that the father was most likely the father of the child. The jury found in favor of the mother and the father appealed. In affirming, the court held that the mother's testimony was clearly a willful contradiction of that given in her divorce proceeding from the other man and her testimony that the father was the father of her child should have been excluded by the trial court. However, the evidence was probably more helpful to the father than harmful. The inconsistent testimony was presented to the jury and thus considered by the jury in terms of the mother's credibility. Further, she was still able to testify as to the sexual relationship between herself and the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a supervisor and an employee-at-will of the board until he signed his first yearly employment contract. More than two years later, in December 1986, the superintendent offered the employee the position of maintenance foreman at the same salary. The employee agreed, but when the board transferred him to the new position, his salary was drastically reduced. In his action for breach of his employment contract, the trial court determined that he had not completed three years of employment as a supervisor, so was not entitled to tenure under the Private Tenure Act, 1941 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 465. On appeal, the court affirmed the part of the trial court's decision holding that the employee's transfer became effective when the board approved the superintendent's recommendation, in December 1986, so he had served approximately two weeks less than three years as a supervisor. The court reversed and remanded, however, with respect to the breach of the employee's 1986-1987 contract, finding that it appeared beyond dispute that the employee was not demoted for cause and had not agreed to a reduction in pay, so he was entitled to submit proof of damages as to the breach.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the statute regarding contingent fees, Tenn.

As for the claim asserted under the Act, the court opined that the Act did not apply, but if it did, by the terms of the Act itself the action was time-barred.

Plaintiff claimed to represent a class of persons whose funds were held by the courts against a defendant's class comprised of all court clerks in the state. The complaint also alleged that the clerk violated his duty as a trustee of the funds by diverting the interest to the county general fund. The appellate court held that (1) the court below had correctly surmised that the composition of the proposed class was too greatly varied to permit certification as a class; (2) the one-year statute of limitations began to run when plaintiff received the funds from the clerk, and his action commencing more than a year later had thus expired; and (3) the clerk operating under the authorization of &sect; 18-5-106(a) to keep the interest earned from funds invested as part of the fees of the office did not violate a fiduciary duty to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The register was not permitted to receive more than the statutory minimum salary, regardless of her need for a deputy or an assistant. The register had to pay any expenses deemed necessary for her office with the fees collected by her office or out of her statutory minimum compensation. The evidence showed that during a one and a half-year period the total fees collected by the register did not meet or exceed her expenses and that she was operating the office at a deficit. The fees collected by her office were not sufficient to pay the approved salaries; therefore, under statutory law, the executor could not have been compelled to supplement fees except to the extent of the register's minimum compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court reversed an order of The Chancery Court of Robertson County (Tennessee) holding against defendant homeowners in plaintiff materialman's action to recover costs of materials ordered by a general contractor, the court reconsidered its opinion in view of a prior opinion on the same issues involving the materialman and another party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners hired a general contractor to build on their property. The contractor purchased materials from the materialman, who made deliveries of materials. The materialman later sued the homeowners to recover costs of the materials. The trial court held for the materialman. On appeal, the court reversed. The court subsequently agreed to reconsider its opinion after it was brought to the court's attention that a conflict might exist between its opinion and a prior opinion involving the materialman and another party. The court noted that in the prior case, the court held that the materialman acquired liens on a homeowner's property under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-11-115 (1982) pursuant to its contract with the general contractor to furnish materials; thus, the materialman had a vested right under &sect; 66-11-115 as it existed prior to amendment of mechanic's lien laws. The court found that in the instant case, the record did not show any contract between the materialman and the contractor; however, the materialman claimed a valid contract. The court thus vacated the trial court's ruling and remanded for a determination based on evidence of a contract predating the amendments.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 49-3-301, et seq., and the Distribution of Locally Assessed Sales Tax, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-6-712, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court held that Tennessee's system for funding education violated the equal protection requirements of the state's constitution. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the education clause of the constitution, Tenn. Const. Art. XI, &sect; 12, required the general assembly to provide for a system of free public schools, not actually provide them. By provide for, the court explained that the general assembly had a constitutional duty to enact laws governing the standards of a system of public schools. Under the general assembly's fragmented system, which was operated by state and local government, achieving an exact equality of education was impossible, but the principle of fairness should apply. The court held that the state constitution did not guarantee that every child in every county would receive an education exactly equal to that received by children in all other counties. While it may be true that some children did not have access to the required opportunities, the school districts presented no evidence as to the officials, regulations or laws which denied the access, and the court could not grant relief without evidence of the producing cause of the denial.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found that the only property owners that were allowed to contest the annexation ordinance by way of a quo warranto proceeding as described in Tenn.

The court held that the annexation statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-103, provided the exclusive means to challenge an annexation ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual sought review of an order of the Chancery Court Of Davidson County (Tennessee), which denied that part of her petition against defendant attorney general that sought investigative records of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) and denied her request for attorney's fees. The individual sought access to public records regarding the prosecution of another individual, pursuant to the Tennessee Public Records Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court allowed the individual access to the public records she requested except those belonging to the TBI. She contended that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 10-7-504(a)(2), which exempted the TBI's investigative records from disclosure and investigation constituted a prohibited restraint on the public's right to public records in violation of Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8 and 19. On appeal the court affirmed because the statute was constitutional and the individual was not due attorney's fees. The court found that there was no generally recognized state or federal constitutional right of access to public records. The individual's right to examine public records arose from the statute. The court found that the court properly denied the individual's request for attorney's fees pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 10-7-505(g) because that section granted fees to a claimant only when a governmental entity wilfully refused to disclose a public record. The attorney general's position with regard to the individual's request was consistent with that of the state in a pending appeal regarding the availability of the records, thus the attorney general's denial was not wilful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to deny the individual's request for TBI investigative records pursuant to the state public records act and to deny the individual an award of attorney's fees. Costs of the appeal were taxed against the individual and the cause was remanded to the trial court for the collection of costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners entered into a contract with a general contractor for the construction of a single-family dwelling. The general contractor then contracted with the materialmen to furnish the necessary materials. When the general contractor filed bankruptcy prior to paying the materialmen, they filed materialmen's liens against the property owners' land and sought to enforce the liens. The trial court granted summary judgments for the materialmen enforcing their liens and awarding them personal judgments. The court vacated the personal judgments and, otherwise, affirmed the judgments. Under their contracts with the general contractor, and, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-11-115 (1982), the materialmen acquired liens on the property, which, by virtue of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-11-104 (1982), attached as of the date of the visible commencement of operations. Thus, the materialmen had vested rights under the law as it existed prior to July 1, 1990, and the 1990 amendments to the law, codified at Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-11-146 (Supp. 1990), did not divest them of those rights. Because the materialmen did not have contracts with the property owners, the personal judgments were erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The utility filed an action to have the Act declared unconstitutional.

The court affirmed the dismissal of the action because the utility failed to join indispensable parties. Because the right of the customers to elect their own utility board members was to be affected, they were indispensable parties. Also, the bondholders were indispensable parties because their rights were to have been affected. Because the registrar had no authority to enforce the bond resolution, there would have been no parties to enforce the bondholders' rights under the resolution.

The applicant was first refused by the City's Beer Board, and then by the City's Mayor and Board of Aldermen. The applicant sought review in the trial court by a statutory writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant owned property 271 feet from a church, and the Beer Board refused to issue the applicant a permit for an off-premises beer license, pursuant to the City's beer ordinance, Collierville, TN., City Ordinance 88-29 &sect; 2-211(12), because the applicant's place of business was within 500 feet of a church. The decision was upheld by the Mayor and Board of Aldermen, and thereafter, the applicant presented a proposed amendment to the beer ordinance to change the mode of measuring distances between properties, which proposal was rejected by the Beer Board and the Mayor and Board of Aldermen. The applicant sought review of the denial of the permit, and the trial court upheld the decision. The applicant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the beer ordinance was constitutional and had not been discriminatorily applied to the applicant. The court determined that similar businesses within close proximity to churches had valid off-premises beer permits by virtue of the beer ordinance's grandfather clause and that because the beer ordinance's distance requirement was promulgated under the authority of a valid statute, the beer ordinance itself was constitutionally valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) the nursing home was part of a pervasively regulated industry, and therefore was not immune to warrantless searches, (2) the underlying cause or justification for the questioned inspection was the general responsibility of the Department of Health and Environment to protect the health, safety and welfare of the patients, (3) the statement made by the nursing home's representative which terminated the inspection was unjustified and constituted a general refusal to be inspected, and (4) absent a showing of specific danger to patients resulting from the refusal, suspension of admissions was not available as a device to compel submission to inspection.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer challenged a judgment of the Chancery Court of Roane County (Tennessee), which granted defendants' motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner wanted to convert the factory into a hazardous waste reclamation center. The board authorized the issuance of industrial revenue bonds to finance the operation. The complaint alleged that the board's composition from members of civic organizations was unconstitutional and that its financial support of the proposed operation contradicted its anti-pollution mandate. None of the owner's current activities were alleged to have harmed the taxpayer, and the complaint alleged no specific injury to him resulting from the board's action. The gravamen of the complaint was that once the factory was converted to its proposed use, it might again become a nuisance. That argument was directed at the owner and the court ruled that it stated no cause of action. The taxpayer simply sought to forestall a speculative wrong that had not occurred by attacking the legitimacy of the alleged future wrongdoers' financier. The taxpayer lacked standing to sue the board for its issuance of the bonds because the issuance alone did not impact him differently from other taxpayers. The taxpayer's constitutional attack was waived pursuant to Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7) because it was unsupported.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the landfill company had received the required approval of the governing body through its Planning Commission and its Board of Zoning Appeals.

Code Ann. &sect; 68-33-101, et seq., except it had not gone before the governing body of the county to secure additional approval. The court held that it was error for the trial court to find that approval could not be given for the location of the landfill by an administrative agency of the governing body, the Board of Zoning Appeals, but that consent could be given only by the governing body because a governing body may delegate administrative powers to a planning commission or a board of zoning appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association contended that the resolution was unconstitutional because it was spot zoning, it was a legislative action solely for the landowner's gain rather than for the public welfare, and it was arbitrary and capricious. The court found that the resolution changed the zoning of the landowner's property to a business zoning, but left the surrounding property zoned residential. However, since the passage of that ordinance, numerous lots on the Highway 11-W corridor had been rezoned for business use, the nearest being approximately 0.4 miles from the association. Thus, there was a growing trend toward business zoning in the area surrounding the association. The evidence demonstrated a growing trend toward business zoning along Highway 11-W in the area surrounding the association and, therefore, the court found that the resolution was not an exercise of spot zoning nor was it arbitrary and capricious or unreasonable.

Affirming, the court concluded that the action did not survive after the property owners transferred their interests. Judicial review of the City's annexation was available only through the statute,&nbsp;&sect; 6-51-103, which provided only limited rights. The provision for the substitution of parties under Tenn. R.

The judiciary's only role in reviewing annexation actions was provided by the statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-51-103.

Defendant was acquitted of a charge of rape but adjudged a delinquent for using a minor for obscene purposes. Affirming, the court held that a sexual encounter with any person, the instigator or a third person, was within the legislative concept of an &quot;obscene purpose.&quot; The court found that the subsequent repeal of &sect; 39-17-915 did not exonerate defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the newspaper and reporter's motion for summary judgment on all issues. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court found that, regarding the defamation claim, a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the scope of the agent's responsibilities, which was determinative of his status as a public official.

Numerous RCCs, including the pager corporation, applied for authority to service the three markets involved. The court held that: (1) the administrative judge's interpretation of the Act was correct; (2) the Act was constitutional in that it created a regulated monopoly the purpose of which was rationally related to the public welfare as stated in Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought a paternity action against the father and a blood test established the likelihood of parentage. A juvenile court referee determined parentage, ordered payment of expenses of birth, medical expenses in the future, and child support.

Section 36-2-108(b) required the juvenile court to make provision for the birth expenses in an order as a result of a paternity action. It did not require the father to pay all of the expenses. The judgment was supported by substantial evidence, and the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the payment under the facts submitted.

After the annexation, the property owners subdivided the portion of the farm which lay to the north of the annexed tract. By referendum pursuant to Tenn.

On appeal, the court rejected the property owners' contention that the previously annexed strip of land created a corridor or a narrow strip of land which was included in the annexation for the sole purpose of making the land in the subdivision contiguous with the property owners' farm. Since the Town correctly followed the statutes in its annexation referendum, the court rejected the property owners' equal protection and due process argument which challenged their farm's being included in the same referendum with the subdivision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father's declaratory judgment action alleged that the child was conceived at a time when the husband and the wife were separated and the wife was cohabitating with him. The putative father sought a declaration that he was the natural father of the child and asked the trial court to establish his reasonable rights and responsibilities as the natural father, including the right of visitation, the responsibility to pay support, and to participate in decisions concerning the child's health and welfare. The putative father attacked the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-201 et seq., the legitimation statute, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-2-101 et seq., the statute establishing paternity, because they provided no legal remedy to exercise the putative father's right of contact with the child or his right to participate in the determination of the interest of the child. The trial court sustained the husband and the wife's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted, Tenn. R. Civ. P. 12. On appeal, the court agreed that the issues for determination had been previously adjudicated adversely to the putative father's position.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court reversed the summary judgment. The court held that a particular purchaser's being deterred from purchasing the property was not a prerequisite because the landowners could show that the actions caused them actual pecuniary loss and they should not have to sell property they wished to keep in order to be made whole. Expenses incurred in the action to quiet title were recoverable as special damages because they were directly and proximately caused by the real estate brokers' conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a landowner and an advocacy group, sought review of an order of the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee) that found in favor of defendant city in an action challenging Nashville, Tenn., zoning ordinance &sect; 22.10, which prohibited placing manufactured housing in residential districts. The trial court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;13-24-201 (1987) did not protect the landowner's double-wide manufactured home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner sought to place a double-wide manufactured home on property zoned for single-family residences. When the city refused his permit and refused to rezone his property to allow the manufactured home, he and an advocacy group filed an action against the city. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in its interpretation of &sect; 13-24-201. Because the statute could be interpreted two ways, the court looked to legislative intent to determine whether the statute excluded all structures coming within the definition of a manufactured home under &sect; 68-36-202(4), as well as mobile homes constructed as a single, self-contained unit. The court found that the legislators intended to exempt structures that were manufactured and transported in at least two sections and then joined together at the site. The completed structure had to have the same general appearance as a site built home. Although the landowner's double-wide came within the city zoning ordinance's definition of mobile home, the court held that to construe the ordinance that way would have violated the statute; therefore, the landowner's home was not prohibited by the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that the city could refuse to allow the landowner to locate a double-wide manufactured home on his property. The court remanded the case to the trial court to enter a decision in accordance with the court's opinion. The court taxed the costs of the appeal to the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After 18 years, the employer discharged the employee for chronic abuse of sick leave and because of her past employment history.

On appeal, the employee argued that a policy manual issued by the employer constituted an employment contract. The employer argued that the policy manual did not constitute an employment contract and that the employment relationship was terminable at will. The court agreed with the employer. The court pointed out that the express language found in the policy manual indicated that it was not a contract between the employer and its employees. The court then noted that employment for an indefinite period of time was a contract at-will, and could be terminated by either party with or without cause. In this case, the court found that the employment contract was a contract at-will.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's wife underwent surgery in which pieces of Teflon felt called &quot;pledgets&quot; were used to close her lung.

The trial court granted the surgeon's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the administrator's suit since the case was not filed within one year as was required by Tenn.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that an exception to the one-year limitations period did not apply since the surgeon had intentionally, and not negligently, placed the &quot;pledgets&quot; into the body. The court further held that the evidence was insufficient to toll the statute of limitations for fraudulent concealment since &quot;pledgets&quot; were the best devices known at the time to support the wife's procedure, the surgeon was not aware of any warnings against their use, and the operation was discussed with the wife. The court concluded that Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed an action to declare that its ordinance was legal. Defendants filed an action seeking injunctive relief from the ordinance. After the county enacted the ordinance, defendants entered into their lease agreement. The lessee operated a landfill on the lessor's property with knowledge that this violated the ordinance. Although the court upheld the injunction for defendants, the contested judgment of the trial court was reversed for the county. The action was remanded for the county to cure a defect in the ordinance by adding a zoning classification for sanitary landfills. The trial court improperly granted the county's request for relief because it was a legislative matter of zoning that the judiciary could not have performed. The court decided not to engage in &quot;spot zoning&quot; until after the ordinance was amended. The court found no evidence proving that a total exclusion of sanitary landfills from a county would have promoted the public health, safety, and morals. The court found no evidence that the lessee was misled to believe that a landfill was permitted. The court found that the lessee did not have a vested right to operate the landfill based on the facts.</SPAN></P>

The mother argued that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-117(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally denied certain natural parents the right to automatically revoke their surrender of parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother decided to surrender her infant, conceived as a result of rape, for adoption. She signed the surrender form before the trial court in the company of her mother and the adoptive parents' attorney. What she was told about her right to revoke the surrender was disputed. The mother testified that she was told she had an absolute right to revoke the surrender within 15 days. She also testified that she did not know that the adoptive parents could contest her right of revocation. She did understand, however, that after the surrender the child would become a ward of the court and that if she revoked the surrender, the trial court would have to decide what was in the best interest of the child. The mother argued that when she timely revoked the surrender, the trial court erred in finding that it was in the best interest of the child not to allow the mother's revocation of her surrender. The court affirmed the judgment because where a petition for adoption was filed, the state had an interest in seeing that such an action was not nullified unless it was in the best interest of the child to do so. The court upheld the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-1-117(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed an application for a conditional use permit to build an asphalt plant on property in an industrial area. The board denied the permit on the ground that the property did not have direct access to a street designated on a major street plan as required by Nashville, Tenn., Zoning Reg. &sect; 103.71. The trial court affirmed the decision of the board. On appeal the court held that the language of &sect; 103.71 was clear and unambiguous, requiring direct access to a street designated on the major street plan and not merely access. The court noted that the phrase &quot;direct access&quot; was not an arcane or technical term and that its significance could be discerned from the ordinary and natural meaning of its words. The court found that &sect; 103.71 was not unconstitutional because there was a rational basis for its classification. By requiring asphalt plants to be located on major roads, those roads would be able to accommodate the traffic more safely and would be better able to withstand the wear and tear of the heavy trucks going to and from the plants. The court concluded, therefore, that the property owner had failed to demonstrate the regulation's unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that as to the equal protection exception, the daughter and the mother alleged that defendants' failure to arrest the rapist and to continue the investigation was a result of her being a woman. That allegation was sufficient to state a claim under &sect; 1983.

On review, the trial court determined that the currency was properly forfeited by the Commissioner, but that there was no authority to support the Commissioner's conditioning the return of the seized vehicle on payment into a drug fund.

The mother alleged that the grandparents failed to prove that their visitation rights were in the best interests of the children and that the trial court's order for visitation rights was excessive. The court affirmed the trial court and held that the grandparents' visitation rights statute applied and that the grandparents met their burden of proof in a previous proceeding. The court modified the trial court's visitation schedule to provide for visitation the first Saturday of each month. The legislative intent was that the paternal grandparents had visitation rights even though the children had been adopted by their stepfather. The father's termination of his parental rights did not affect his parents' right to visit their grandchildren.

The ex-husband requested a modification of the decree to eliminate his obligation for two of his daughters who had attained the age of 18. The trial court continued the support as detailed in the agreement. On appeal, the court held that the father was relieved of his obligation to provide support for his oldest child because she was emancipated, living in a common law marriage apart from her mother, and had abandoned formal education. The court determined from the context and content of the agreement that there was no agreement to pay support to the ex-wife for the emancipated adult child for whom no support was being provided. The court held that the farm property was not alimony in solido material. The original indebtednesses were assumed by the ex-wife, and new indebtednesses negotiated.</SPAN></P>
