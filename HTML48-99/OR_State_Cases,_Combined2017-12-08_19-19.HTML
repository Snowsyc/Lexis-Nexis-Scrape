</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The primary purpose of the roadblock in which defendant was stopped was to detect persons driving under the influence of intoxicants and gather evidence for use in those persons' criminal prosecutions. The secondary purpose was to check driver licenses and vehicle registrations. The trial court had balanced the public need for sobriety roadblocks against the individual's interest in privacy to reach the conclusion that the evidence should not have been suppressed. The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals and reversed the trial court's decision. The court noted that before government officials could embark on a search or seizure for evidence to be used for this purpose, they must have individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. The court found that because the stopping of defendant's car and his seizure occurred in the absence of any belief that he had committed an offense, the officers failed to comply with the constitutional standards for searches and seizures provided by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff driver brought an action against defendants, county, state, and officers (collectively defendants), seeking injunctive relief and punitive damages under the Oregon Tort Claims Act (Act), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.260-.300, alleging violation of state law and state and federal constitutional rights. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) reversed. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Police officers established a nighttime sobriety roadblock (a fixed checkpoint at which all cars were stopped). The driver was stopped, questioned about her alcohol consumption, detained for a sobriety field test and released. The court of appeals held that the roadblock violated the warrant clause of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court affirmed and held that roadblocks were seizures of persons. The power to seize did not arise by implication from Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.030, allowing the police broad authority to &quot;prevent crime.&quot; Authority to conduct the roadblocks as an administrative search required a law or ordinance detailing the purpose of the search and the limits of executive authority. No such authority existed in the case sub judice. Thus, the driver was entitled to declaratory relief that defendants' conduct was illegal. The Act barred a punitive damages claim against defendants. Punitive damages were unavailable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because no violation of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, occurred. The officers' discretion was limited. All drivers were stopped. Only if there was suspicion a driver was intoxicated was a filed sobriety test conducted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In consolidated appeals, the prosecution contested the decision of the Oregon Court of Appeals that affirmed the trial court judgment which dismissed defendants' indictments for aggravated murder and felony murder on the ground that the term &quot;torture&quot; as used in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095(1)(e) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The lower courts found that the term &quot;torture&quot; as used in &sect; 163.095(1)(e) was unconstitutionally vague. The prosecution appealed and prevailed. A criminal statute violated Or. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 20, 21 if it was so vague that it allowed a judge or jury unbridled discretion to decide what conduct was prohibited in a given case. A statute did not need to define an offense so precisely that, in every case, a person could determine the specific conduct that would fall within that statute's reach, but a reasonable degree of certainty was required by Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20, 21. Under the federal constitution, due process required that a statute defining criminal conduct be sufficiently explicit to provide notice of the forbidden conduct. Application of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.095(1)(e) required the prosecution to prove that defendant had the infliction of pain as one of the objectives for his conduct, apart from responsibility for the victim's death. The statute did not require the prosecution to prove that the pain was inflicted for one of several enumerated purposes such as revenge, coercion, or sadistic pleasure. Motive was rarely a criminal element.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the lower court judgments and remanded the causes to the trial court for reinstatement of defendants' indictments and further proceedings consistent herewith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant pleaded guilty to assault in the third degree and attempted kidnapping in the second degree, the trial judge ordered a psychiatric examination preparatory to considering sentencing under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.735, the dangerous offender statute. The State presented the written report of the examining psychiatrist who failed to appear. Defendant moved the court to reset the hearing and direct the witness to appear so that defendant would be able to examine the witness. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was sentenced as a dangerous offender. He appealed, claiming error in the trial court's denial of his earlier request to withdraw his guilty plea and the court's failure to allow him to examine the psychiatrist. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Because defendant made no claim that the procedural flaw prevented the court from determining upon appellate review whether the sentence exceeded the maximum sentence allowable by law or was unconstitutionally cruel and unusual, he did not raise a challenge to the sentence itself and therefore, his claim of procedural error was beyond the court's limited scope of review.</SPAN></P>

Named as defendants were the judge, the state, and the county district attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.617 provided that in criminal proceedings, the prosecutor could move the court to order a witness to testify or produce evidence. A summary hearing, held outside the presence of the jury and the public, would then determine if the witness should be compelled to testify or produce evidence. The newspaper and reporter brought an action after the reporter and other members of the public were excluded from a summary hearing in a highly publicized murder trial. The circuit court granted defendants' motions to dismiss. The appellate court affirmed and held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.617 was constitutional because the public's right to access only encompassed the right to relevant and admissible evidence. On appeal, the court held that either the hearing must be open or the government must acquiesce in the witness' refusal to testify. The government could not create a secret court by pleading that it must act in secret to avoid infringing the witness' right against self-incrimination. Rather, both obligations must be satisfied to not violate the open administration of justice provision in the Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

When they sought judicial review the intermediate court decided on its own motion that the challenge went beyond LUBA's jurisdiction and ordered LUBA to dismiss the proceeding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The company, owner, and owner's son appealed the court of appeals' decision. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part, reinstating the trial court's judgment. The court found that the son's conduct was intentional as required for the interference with contractual relationship claim. There was testimony that he told other employees that the employee would not be working for the company much longer. He also refused to cooperate with her when she required information in order to perform her job. The son knew that he was interfering with the employee's job performance and therefore had the requisite knowledge that he was interfering with her employment relationship. The son's conduct also was in pursuit of an improper motive. He physically and verbally intimidated the employee and also threatened her and defamed her to other employees. Those were improper means that in fact resulted in injury to the employee's employment relationship with the company. The court found that there was insufficient evidence of intentional conduct necessary to sustain a verdict against the owner or the company for interference with a contractual relationship.</SPAN></P>

Section 166.065(1)(e) prohibited subjecting another to alarm or annoyance by telephonic use of obscenities or description of sexual conduct. Defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint on the grounds that &sect; 166.065(1)(e) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face. The district court overruled the demurrer, and defendant was convicted of the charge. The appellate court reversed the district court. The State sought review. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 166.065(1)(e) violated the right to freedom of speech provided in Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court reasoned that &sect; 166.065(1)(e) was overbroad because it would also prohibit calls between spouses, lovers or friends that may from time to time cause annoyance and consensual calls from legitimate polling organizations collecting data on attitudes relating to sexual matters. Further, the language of &sect; 166.065(1)(e) proscribed legitimate calls from physicians to patients dealing with sexual matters that cause alarm. The court also concluded that &sect; 166.065(1)(e) was vague because it unconstitutionally delegated power to a judge or jury to decide what was obscene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state of Oregon appealed from the Oregon Court of Appeals, which reversed defendant's convictions, holding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.087 was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant had been prosecuted and convicted of dissemination of obscene material and possession of obscene material with the intent to disseminate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A jury found defendant guilty of dissemination of obscene material and possession of obscene material with the intent to disseminate in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.087. The appellate count reversed the convictions, holding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and the State of Oregon sought review. It upheld the lower appellate court's decision reversing the convictions, on different grounds. Rather than finding the statute to be constitutionally vague, the court held that the statute violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because it restricted speech on a ground (obscenity) that could not be justified as an historical exception from Oregon's constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression. The court noted that Oregon's free speech protection, covering &quot;any subject whatever,&quot; was broader than that of the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court reviewed the historical development of obscenity laws and concluded that restrictions on sexually explicit or obscene expressions were not well established at the time that its Constitution was adopted.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writ of mandamus, holding that &sect;&sect; 14.250-.270 were constitutional. Relator was entitled to a hearing on her motion for a change of judge because her allegation that the assigned judge was prejudiced against criminal defendants was sufficient to disqualify the judge if it was made in good faith.

The court affirmed the appellate court's decision reversing the trial court's decision granting judgment for the business. SAIF was neither a private corporation nor a municipal corporation and was not within the prohibition under Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2, which prohibited the formation of corporations by the legislative assembly's special laws. The Legislative Assembly expressly chose the form of a corporation to manage the workers' compensation insurance coverage. The legislature wanted to give the program numerous features common to insurance companies. However, SAIF was not a corporation as a form for conducting business enterprise with private investment by and for the profit of stockholders or a corporation as a form of organizing municipal authority and services with territorially-defined taxing authority. The creation of a corporation for a public purpose was permitted under Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2, as long as the members were citizens and it was an instrument of the government subject to legislative control.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 131.515(2) barred separate prosecutions for offenses based on the same criminal episode. However, a guilty plea was no bar to subsequent prosecution under a charge filed no later than 30 days after entry of the plea, with the guilty plea voided at defendant's request, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 131.525(2). The court reversed, holding that a plea of guilty was jeopardy, though the state later offered to vacate the conviction. Under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, statutory violations were the same offense for jeopardy purposes even if each contained different elements. A conviction of a guilty plea was similar to a conviction after trial or an acquittal, for jeopardy purposes. A second prosecution was for the same offense if the charges arose out of the act and were known to the state at the time of the first prosecution and could have been brought in the first prosecution. While driving while intoxicated and driving without a license were elements of separate statutes that defendant's single act of operating the automobile violated, defendant could not have been twice put in jeopardy for that same act in successive prosecutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An explanatory statement was prepared to accompany Ballot Measure 15 in the voters' pamphlet. The waste facility contended that the explanatory statement was insufficient and unclear. Specifically, the explanatory statement failed to state that its sole immediate effect would have been to close down a waste facility operated by the waste facility and to require the removal of all radioactive deposits. The court noted that because the waste facility was the only facility affected by the measure, it was appropriate to identify it as so. The court held that the failure of the committee to state that effect rendered it insufficient. However, other wording recommend by the waste facility was repetitious. The court also concluded that the explanatory abatement adequately stated the measure's practical effect, which was to regulate described zirconium wastes not presently regulated by the Energy Facility Siting Council. The court also determined that the statement correctly stated that radioactive materials, which pose no significant danger to public health and safety, would not be regulated as radioactive waste by the Council.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the school district should not have been granted standing before the appellate court to file a petition that sought to affirm, not oppose, the superintendent's decision; that the statutes should not have been invalidated on federal Constitutional grounds because they were valid on state constitutional grounds; and that the superintendent could rule on the constitutionality of the statutes, not just enforce them.

Three issues were presented: (1) whether the court's review of a court of appeals decision that upheld the validity of a rule was rendered moot when an agency promulgated a new rule superseding the challenged rule; (2) whether a circuit court determined the validity of a rule in the course of a civil action for nuisance and trespass when the claims arose from a state agency's actions pursuant to a rule; and (3) if the circuit court could determine a rule's validity, whether the rule at issue in fact valid, thereby justifying the agencies' motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court dismissed the petition for judicial review because the challenged rule had expired and was superceded by a new rule. The court held that only when a party placed a rule's validity at issue in a separate civil action could circuit courts determine a rule's validity. The court found that the general policy of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 390.610(4) was to do whatever was necessary to preserve and protect scenic and recreational use of Oregon's ocean shore.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general submitted a draft ballot title for the proposed amendment to the secretary and, following the proponent's comments, certified to the secretary the revised ballot title. The proponents sought review of the ballot title. The court concluded that the revised ballot title submitted by the attorney general did not substantially comply with the requirements of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035 because it did not correctly identify the subject matter or accurately state the chief purpose of the proposed measure. The use of the term &quot;banning&quot; in the caption of the revised ballot title did not accurately identify the subject matter because the measure did not actually ban or prohibit any property use regulation. The measure prohibited government taking of property value or rights through zoning that was not essential to public health and safety without the payment of just compensation. The government's cessation of such zoning because of the increased cost was speculation, which was improperly included as a consequence of the measure.

The court affirmed the conviction. The Division had sent a letter notifying defendant of the suspension by certified mail, return receipt requested. Defendant did not claim the certified mail, and it was returned to the Division marked &quot;unclaimed.&quot; The court held that defendant had been properly notified under &sect; 482.570 and that the statute did not require actual receipt. Defendant could not establish the affirmative defense of lack of notice by not claiming certified mail after he was advised by the postal service that the certified mail was to be picked up at the post office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The city had adopted an ordinance that defined and prohibited prostitution in terms substantially identical to the state and also adopted a mandatory minimum penalty provision for violation of the ordinance. There was no mandatory minimum penalty for a conviction of prostitution under state law. Defendant was charged with prostitution under the ordinance. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming state criminal law &quot;preempted&quot; the ordinance. The district court granted the motion. The city appealed. The court of appeals agreed with the trial court that the city's mandatory minimum penalty provision was invalid, but that the ordinance prohibiting prostitution was valid. Both defendant and the city petitioned for further review. On review, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed. The city's mandatory minimum penalty for prostitution was harsher than the state's minimum penalty for the same offense. Thus, the court held the city's mandatory minimum penalty provision, as applied to the crime of prostitution was invalid. The court concluded, as did the court of appeals, that the invalid mandatory minimum penalty section was severable.</SPAN></P>

The public official argued that the commission had not proved the three elements of &sect; 244.040(1) that (1) a public official (2) used his office (3) to cause or realize a financial gain. He argued that while he did realize a financial gain when he purchased the car, he did not &quot;use&quot; his office in doing so, and that (1) the statute prohibited only influence peddling and (2) the use of the public office and the benefit received must be causally connected. The court held that the commission's interpretation of the statute was compatible with the legislative policy to safeguard the public trust and that but for his position the public official would have been unable to purchase the car and, thus, to obtain a personal financial gain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was indicted on March 30, 1972. A trial was scheduled for August 23, 1982.

His eventual trial date was October 12, 1983. Defendant claimed that his constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated. The trial court convicted defendant. The court of appeals rejected defendant's speedy trial claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals. The court held that the 13 1/2 month delay, between August 23, 1982 and October 12, 1983, was attributable to the prosecution. The court could not say that the length of time was so long as to compel a finding that defendant's Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 speedy trial right was violated. Further, while the reason for delay rested solely on the prosecution, its conduct was negligent, not intentional or malicious. Moreover, defendant suffered no prejudice in defending the charges made against him. Thus, on balance, defendant was not deprived of his art. I, &sect; 10 speedy trial rights.

The insurer began denying payment for treatment by the out-of-state chiropractor, although it indicated that it would pay for care by an orthopedist. The court reversed the decision affirming the denial of payment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.245 did not permit a compensation insurer to deny payment for treatment by all out-of-state chiropractors. The language of &sect; 656.245 did not compel the interpretation that an insurer could exclude an entire category of health service providers located outside Oregon while paying for the same health service when provided in Oregon. The court held that a compensation insurer could not deny an entire category of otherwise reasonable out-of-state medical services. Thus, the insurer could not deny payment for treatment by all out-of-state chiropractors if that treatment, as specified in &sect; 656.245, was for conditions resulting from the injury as the nature of the injury or the process of recovery required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed his conviction for first degree manslaughter pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.118. At trial defendant had contended that the psychotherapist-patient privilege under Or. Evid. Code 504 protected statements that he had made to a psychotherapist and her secretary receptionist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After killing his victim, defendant called his brother who told him to call a mental hospital. Defendant then called a state hospital and asked to speak with a doctor. The secretary asked him what the problem was and he stated that he had just killed a man. The psychiatrist who took the call talked with defendant while the secretary contacted the police who then picked defendant up at a pay phone. The court found that defendant specifically requested, and was assured of, confidentiality. The court found that the psychiatrist spoke to defendant in the same way she would have in a psychiatric interview. The statements were protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege, Or. R. Evid. 504. The court also found the statements made to the secretary to be protected. However, the court found that the error in admitting the testimony of the psychiatrist and the secretary was harmless because there was substantial and convincing evidence of defendant's guilt and very little likelihood that the evidential error affected the trial court's decision. Under the inevitable discovery doctrine, the taint of the fruit of the illegal search of defendant's hotel room was removed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, the court noted that thrust of the landowners' complaint was that the issuance of the permits violated the statewide land use planning goals, raising issues lying exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA). Under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.015(10), LUBA had exclusive jurisdiction to review &quot;land use decisions.&quot; The initial inquiry on review was whether the issuance of the permits by the county was a land use decision. The court answered affirmatively. As such, a notice of intent to appeal the decision was required to have been filed with LUBA no later than 30 days after the date the decision sought to be reviewed became final. The landowners failed to do so and their appeal to LUBA was time-barred. The court rejected the landowners' argument that the redefinition of &quot;land use decision&quot; to exclude ministerial-type decisions was intended to clarify what the legislature had intended all along. It also rejected their' arguments regarding the constitutionality of LUBA. The court held that the doctrine of separation of powers did not prevent the exercise of adjudicatory functions by LUBA. The judgment below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that Or. Stat. Ann. &sect; 166.065(1)(d) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and that it was impermissibly vague. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional because it focused on speech alone.

The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment, but for different reasons. The court held that the specific phrases and terms in &sect; 166.065(1)(d) to which defendant objected were not impermissibly vague in violation of the Oregon Constitution, because they adequately informed potential defendants of the prohibited conduct and they did not delegate uncontrolled discretion to a judge or jury to punish or withhold punishment.

The court determined that it was not for the parties involved to determine whether the child was incompetent as a witness and therefore unavailable, but for the judge below to have determined. The court noted that if competent, the victim's statement would have come in by her own testimony, and if not, the statement would have come in as a complaint of sexual misconduct under Or. Evid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer's tangible properties which entered Oregon were prints made from the negatives of taxpayer's motion pictures.

The department modified the formula and determined that the taxpayer owed approximately $ 22,000 more. The taxpayer appealed to the Tax Court, which held that the department had not met its burden of proof to establish that the statutory apportionment formula did not fairly represent the extent of taxpayer's business activity in Oregon. The department appealed, and the court reversed. The court held that: (1) the department could modify the statutory formula; (2) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.670 was applicable to remedy unconstitutional apportionment results and to provide for alternatives to statutory allocation and apportionment in unusual cases; and (3) Or. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of second degree assault and ordered to pay restitution after assaulting his 18 month old son and causing severe physical and mental injuries. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury for the restitution hearing. While defendant was entitled to have all the elements of a crime decided by a jury, the monetary cost of the victim's injury was neither an element of nor an act in the commission of the crime of assault in the second degree. Restitution was not intended to be the equivalent of a civil award and was an aspect of criminal law, not a quasi-civil recovery device. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to a civil jury trial on the issue of restitution. The restitution order did not violate the prohibition of excessive fines under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. Restitution orders were not denominated as fines and could be imposed in addition to fines. Moreover, the order was not excessive because the amount of the order had a reasonable relationship to defendant's criminal conduct since it was based on the actual injuries to his victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.062(1), read in conjunction with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.060(10), restrained expression protected by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and was overbroad. Defendant had been convicted of engaging in sexual conduct in a live public show, a violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.062(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with engaging in sexual conduct in a live public show. He unsuccessfully demurred to the indictment, challenging that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.062(1) and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.060(10) were unconstitutional under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and the First Amendment. He appealed his conviction. The court of appeals held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.062(1) and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.060(10) were unconstitutional, and the State appealed. In affirming, the court held that it was unnecessary to reach the constitutional question because as a factual matter defendant was entitled to a judgment of acquittal. The State was required to prove not only that defendant knowingly engaged in the described touching under &sect; 167.060(10) but that he knowingly participated in the touching in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification. The court found not one scintilla of evidence that defendant ever engaged in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or gratification. Consequently, defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the grounds that the state had produced no evidence on the material elements of the offense should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff taxpayers filed suit against the public officials for unlawful expenditure of federal and matching county grant monies. The taxpayers contended that the public officials expended money for a purpose different than authorized by law when they spent on a fluoridation project at a time when an anti-fluoridation measure was on the city ballot. The trial court ruled in favor of the public officials and the appellate court reversed. On further review, the court affirmed the decision from the appellate court and remanded the case for further proceedings. Health officials did more than attempt to motivate individuals to take measures conducive to preserving their personal health. The public officials attempted to direct government behavior by soliciting citizens to vote to preserve a particular government policy. Whatever authority county health officials had to promote health practices did not extend to requiring public employees to oppose a measure during an election. Issues of fact remained with regard to whether the public officials required public employees to engage in these activities, and if so, whether the public officials had any defenses against liability.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27 was intended to give private citizens the right to possess certain arms for the defense of person and property. The court ruled that the meaning of &quot;arms&quot; in the Oregon Constitution, as contemplated by the framers, included not only fire-arms, but also hand-carried weapons used for personal protection. The court concluded that a switch-blade was not so substantially different from its historical antecedent, the pocketknife, that it was included within the constitutional grant of a right to bear arms. The court held that because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.510(1) proscribed the mere possession and mere carrying of the weapon it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Two minor children died in an automobile collision while traveling in an automobile driven by their father. The children's mother, their personal representative, filed wrongful death actions against both drivers, alleging that each was responsible for the collision by one or more of several specifications of negligent driving, as well as wilful driving while intoxicated. The circuit court dismissed the complaints against the father on the ground that he was immune from liability for negligence toward his children, and the court of appeals affirmed the decision. On appeal, the court reversed the decision because the father was not immune from liability. The court held that the father's acts or omissions were not privileged and were tortious toward the children; therefore, the mother had stated a claim for relief. The court rejected the doctrine of parental immunity given the significant change in the state's policy concerning a driver's liability toward guest passengers.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed, and defendants appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the statute did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, nor was it unconstitutional as being overbroad and vague. The court examined whether the law was intended to limit communication, or whether its prohibition was directed against causing a harm that might be brought about incidentally by communication, and concluded that the latter applied. No privilege applied to speech that was intended to place another in fear of imminent serious physical injury. Further, after interpreting the menacing statute in the context of its common law assault origins, it did not reach communications protected either by the constitution or common law privilege. Finally, although the statute did not reach constitutionally protected behavior and an overbreadth analysis did not apply, the court found that the statute adequately informed citizens, judges, juries, and prosecutors of the conduct it made criminal.</SPAN></P>

The project failed. The ratepayers filed suit to have the agreements nullified. After interventions on both sides, the trial court found that the agreements ultra vires under the charters and Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9. The participants appealed. The court reversed. Legislative history was not evidence of the prior law. The Joint Operating Act and the TPFA were supplemental grants of authority to the charters and not restrictions. Prior voter approval was not needed because the utility issued the bonds, and not the cities. The debt limitation laws had a &quot;special fund&quot; exception which allowed the pledge of future utility revenues. Section 9 was not violated because the participants were not direct or indirect stockholders in the utility. The &sect; 9 prohibition on loans of credit applied only to the exposure of the government's taxing power, and not other revenue sources such as the utility revenues. The cities and the utility boards had the authority to enter into the agreement, which was unrelated to the success or failure of the project.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pointed out that the indictment referred to the unlawful exercise of his official duties, while the statute used the phrase &quot;in his official duties.&quot; The court held that the use of the word &quot;in&quot; meant to forbid knowing performance of an act that constituted an unauthorized exercise of the powers or opportunities of one's official position. Defendant argued that because the statute applied to a great variety of public servants whose duties were not fixed by any law, written job description, or other document, judges and juries were not able to refer to any fixed standard. The court held that what was &quot;unauthorized&quot; was often a conclusion of law on which a judge was to instruct the jury. The statute did not leave a judge or, under proper instructions, a jury with unconstrained discretion to define a crime.

Basically, the nonprofit corporation argued that the ballot title should include a reference to a &quot;renter equivalent&quot; to the homestead exemption. Under Or. Rev.

Thus, where reasonable minds could differ, the court would follow the judgment of the Attorney General for he had the responsibility to make the choice in the first instance. However, the court agreed with the nonprofit corporation. Under Or. Rev.

The trial court imposed a 15 year minimum sentence (half of the 30 year indeterminate sentence), on the dangerous offender finding, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.110. Defendant appealed, arguing that the minimum sentence provision could not be applied to the dangerous offender sentence. The court affirmed the sentence, holding that the minimum sentence was lawful, and that none of the minimum sentences violated the proportionality requirement of state and federal law. Defendant had argued, based on case law, that because no minimum sentence could be applied to murder, a minimum sentence for any lessor offense would be disproportionate. The court disagreed, holding that prior case law did not say that no minimum could be imposed for murder, but rather, that the legislature had not imposed a minimum sentence for murder.

Subsequently, the tax court issued judgment finding the officer in contempt for failing to obey the peremptory writs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In the alternative writs, the officer was directed to file individual income tax returns for several years. The corporations were also directed to file corporate excise tax returns for multiple years. In response to the subsequent preemptory writs, the officer and the corporations filed tax return forms providing their names, addresses, and telephone numbers, but no other information. The remainder of the forms asserted the privilege against self-incrimination. Following a hearing, the officer was found in contempt of court and ordered to be incarcerated until he complied with the peremptory writ. On appeal, the officer and the corporations asserted the preemptory writs should not have issued.

The lower court reversed the denial and remanded for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment holding that the order was fatally defective under &sect; 133.724(5). The court determined that the order did not mention that the interception be executed as soon as practicable. The court found that the order did not address the minimization of the interception of non-pertinent conversations, in that it did not inform officers to conduct the wiretap in such a way as to minimize interception of such calls. The court also found that the state did not set out a precise objective in the application for the order and that although the order contained a duration of 15 days, it failed to instruct officers that if they gained the objective authorized in the order in some lesser period than contained therein, the interception had to cease.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 469.375. Pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.035 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.065, respondent attorney general drafted a ballot title.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The ballot title provided: Adds Requirements for Approval of Radioactive Waste Disposal Sites. The question posed was: should the Council be required to consider additional factors before approving a site for the disposal of radioactive wastes. The explanation contained in the ballot title provided that the measure would add to existing requirements by requiring the Council to find, before approving a site for the disposal of radioactive wastes, that the site was not subject to water erosion, earthquakes, volcanoes, or landslides; that there was no safer choice for such disposal; and that there would be no radioactive release from the waste site. The litigant argued that the failure to include the phrase &quot;naturally occurring radioactive wastes&quot; would mislead voters by suggesting that the new requirements applied to controversial types of radioactive wastes. The court modified the ballot title by providing in the title: Adds Requirements for Disposing Wastes Containing Naturally Occurring Radioactive Isotopes. The court added the language &quot;naturally occurring radioactive isotopes&quot; in the question and explanation sections of the ballot title.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of two counts of murder. Following the conviction, the trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment with a 10-year mandatory minimum on one count imposed under ORS 144.110(1), which stated that in a felony case, a trial court could impose a minimum term of imprisonment of up to one-half of the imposed sentence. Thereafter, defendant sought review, claiming that the trial court had no authority to impose a mandatory minimum under ORS 114.110(1) because the statute did not authorize a minimum term in the case of a life sentence. In reversing and vacating that portion of the sentence imposing a 10-year minimum, the court held that the legislature had not enacted a provision for imposing a minimum term for murder convictions. Because the legislature never intended to impose a minimum term for life imprisonment and because ORS 144.110(1) did not authorize a sentencing judge to speculate what the exact life span of any given individual would be, the court held that ORS 144.110(1) was not applicable to a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner stalking victims appealed the order of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed a grant of summary judgment to respondents city and police officers for failure to follow the mandatory arrest provisions of Or.

The trial court held that the defenses of official discretion and official immunity precluded potential liability for psychic and physical injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A violent husband stalked his estranged family and friends, assaulted them, and made threats despite a protective order filed with the city police department. Police officers failed to arrest him despite the mandatory arrest provisions of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 133.310(3). The stalking victims filed a complaint that sounded in negligence for the failure to follow the statute. On appeal, the court held that although a separate claim might be pleaded for negligence, the claim here was for violation of a statutory duty and that negligence in the technical sense was not involved. The court held that Oregon law did allow claims for emotional injury arising from the breach of a statutory duty. The court held that the statute was intended to protect a specific class of beneficiaries and that police officers were mandated to arrest as soon as there was probable cause to believe that one person has assaulted another or placed the other in fear of imminent serious physical injury. The court held that although the officers exercised judgment in evaluating complaints, they had no true discretion as to whether to arrest, although factual or legal defenses might have been available for inaction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner pled guilty to violating ORS 541.615(1), which prohibited anyone from remove any material from the beds or banks or fill any state waters without a permit issued under authority of the Director of the Division of State Lands. The charge averred that petitioner unlawfully and with criminal negligence failed to stop work in a stream when directed to do so. Petitioner argued in his action for post-conviction relief that the trial court erred in treating the conviction as a misdemeanor because the statute was outside the Oregon Criminal Code and required no culpable mental state. The intermediate court held that the conviction was a misdemeanor, and the court affirmed. The court found that the statutes facially made it clear that the removal of material in violation of ORS 541.615(1) was a misdemeanor. While the statute required no culpable mental state, it did not clearly dispense with a culpable mental state requirement. The court found that a prosecutor could therefore upgrade a violation of ORS 541.615(1) to a misdemeanor by alleging and proving a culpable mental state.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners sought review, challenging the constitutionality of PECBA as applied. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The employment relationships between petitioners and the counselors were subject to PECBA. The board had performed its administrative function in ensuring petitioners administered their employment relationships in compliance with state laws and the applicable collective bargaining agreement. It was not performing a judicial function or the employment function delegated by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.604(1) to the juvenile court. The application of PECBA caused no interference of unconstitutional proportion. PECBA did not divest the juvenile court of authority to make personnel decisions, nor did the mandate to bargain collectively hinder the juvenile court in the resolution of cases.

A special grand jury was empaneled to investigate the allegations of criminal conduct committed by defendant in the course of his duties as the district attorney. The special grand jury returned indictments against defendant and after a trial, defendant was convicted of theft and official misconduct. Defendant challenged his conviction and argued that the special grand jury was not empaneled in accordance with Or. Const. art.

The appellate court agreed that the special grand jury was improperly empaneled, but that defendant's conviction by a properly impaneled trial jury negated the constitutional violations and was proper. Defendant sought review. The court found that the circuit court judge properly directed the court clerk to summon jurors, and that the prospective grand jurors were not required to be present in court until their names were selected by the circuit court judge and defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by their absence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The question before the court was whether a violation of Portland City Code &sect; 14.08.140(b) constituted a crime requiring the city to prove defendant acted with a culpable mental state and triggered defendant's right to a jury trial under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.001. The court answered the question in the affirmative, reversed the denial of defendant's motion for a jury trial, and remanded. The court found that the culpable mental state of &quot;knowledge&quot; was required by the language of the ordinance and explicit in the complaint. The court reasoned that in order for defendant to &quot;unlawfully refuse&quot; to heed the order of a police officer, the defendant must knowingly refuse to obey the lawful order of the officer. The court also found that Portland City Code &sect; 14.08.020's penalty coupled with the explicit and implicit culpable mental states indicated an intent by the Portland City Council to create a crime and not a violation or infraction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After stopping defendant's car for a faulty headlight, the deputy arrested him for driving under the influence of intoxicants. While defendant was handcuffed, another officer took a small pill bottle containing white powder from defendant's clothing. The officer kept the bottle and a test of it contents revealed that it was cocaine. Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession over his objections to the warrantless search and seizure. On appeal, the court reversed, and held that the evidence should have been suppressed. The court determined that seizure of the pill bottle occurred during the course of an arrest for a crime unrelated to the bottle. The court found that a warrantless seizure made incident to a lawful arrest had to be limited to items that reasonably related to the probable cause for the arrest. The court ruled that other effects unrelated to the reason for the arrest could also have been seized if their nature as contraband was evident on sight. The court concluded that where a test of unknown substance was necessary, the officer was required to secure the item for the least amount of time needed to obtain a warrant for further search.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the circuit court that even without ad hominem discrimination, the case fell within the principle that equal treatment must not be denied &quot;haphazardly&quot; by ad hoc decisions that did not uniformly rest on meaningful criteria that made the privileges of a preliminary hearing equally available to all persons similarly situated, or, in the constitutional phrase, upon the same terms. The court stated that it was clear that such day-by-day &quot;logistical&quot; circumstances as the readiness of the prosecutor or the coincidence of an empty courtroom or a crowded hearing calendar could not determine the grant or denial of an important procedural step in the defense against a criminal prosecution, if the assurance that privileges had to be provided upon the same terms was to have any meaning.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 109.125, for a child it had been supporting. The child was over seven years old when the State filed the action, and the alleged father pled the statutory limitation of six years. The trial court held that the &quot;illegitimate&quot; child's right to support from the natural parent was a substantial right and was a right equal to that of the &quot;legitimate&quot; child's. Hence, any statute limiting this right during a child's minority worked an illogical injustice on a child born out of wedlock and was constitutionally impermissible. The court of appeals ruled that weighing the state's interest in enacting the statutory limitation of six years against the constitutional rights of an illegitimate child to the protection of the laws equal to that afforded legitimate children, it hold that the six-year statute of limitations was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals and the circuit court because Or. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted for possession of a controlled substance and being an ex-convict in possession of a firearm. He sought to suppress evidence that was obtained during a warrantless entry and search of his motel room by police officers, and the search of his person after his arrest. The court was concerned with the validity of two searches and seizures, that of the motel room, which disclosed a gun, and that of defendant's person, which uncovered drugs. The court reversed because the police officers' warrantless entry into the motel room was, at most, based upon a reasonable suspicion, but supported with less than probable cause. A remote possibility of harm to the police officers did not justify a warrantless entry. Absent articulable facts that evidenced a compelling and urgent need for the entry, the state constitution demanded the issuance of a warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer brought an amended complaint in the tax court, naming as defendants the county assessor and three county appraisers. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that they were not proper parties and that the Department was a necessary party not joined. The taxpayer argued that jurisdiction was proper in the tax court because all of his claims arose under tax law, and he filed a motion to join the Department if it was a necessary party. The tax court denied the motion to join and dismissed the complaint. The taxpayer appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that that some of the claims of the complaint did &quot;arise under&quot; tax law and were within the tax court's jurisdiction. The court found that a claim was not one &quot;arising under the tax laws&quot; unless it had some bearing on tax liability. Therefore, the court opined that the taxpayer's tort claims against tax assessors were not within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the tax court. However, the court concluded that the claims regarding the taxpayer's qualification for forest-land tax status did &quot;arise under&quot; the tax laws and were within the tax court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed a declaratory action challenging the imposition of the tax and seeking an injunction against the tax. The tax court granted the State summary judgment and declared the taxpayer's action moot because no one attempted a referendum to make the temporary tax permanent within the constitutional time limit. The taxpayer sought review. The court found that the words contained in &sect; 797 were interpreted at their face value, that &sect; 797 did not chill the State's citizens' power of referendum regarding the temporary tax, and that &sect; 797 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The board dismissed a permanent teacher on grounds of inefficiency, immorality, and gross unfitness after the teacher was found at an adult bookstore during an undercover investigation by the police department. The teacher appealed to the FDAB, which affirmed the dismissal. The appellate court upheld the FDAB's decision. The teacher appealed and the court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and remanded the case. The court found that the commission had conducted a preliminary investigation and found a lack of probable grounds for action against the teacher under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 342.175-342.177. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 342.865(1)(i) did not confer on the school board or the FDAB independent authority to interpret the grounds for revocation of a teaching certificate. Where the commission had determined that a particular set of facts did not constitute grounds for revocation neither the school board nor the FDAB could reach a different interpretation. The court held that the order affirming the teacher's dismissal was inadequate. The FDAB nowhere set forth any basis upon which it could have concluded that the teacher's conduct violated that standard.</SPAN></P>

The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The property owner alleged that the city temporarily deprived it of the rental value of the property at issue and caused a permanent depression of its market value by designating the major part of the property as a future park site in the city's comprehensive land use plan.

The complaint also alleged claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1985(3). On appeal from the trial court's dismissal, the court found that the complaint sufficed to survive a motion to dismiss. According to the complaint, the city told the property owners to hold parts of their land for the park district, subject to taxes and without an opportunity to make economic use of it or to place it on the market, until the district was politically and financially ready to buy it for the planned park. This language was broad enough to state a claim.

The taxpayers claimed that to require payment of the challenged assessment prior to judicial review deprived them of property without due process of law. The taxpayers also alleged equal protection violations in that the requirement of payment before judicial review applied to income taxes, but not to other taxes. In affirming the decision, the court found that the taxpayers' equal protection rights were not violated. Every taxpayer that appealed an assessment of a personal income tax had to pay the tax before judicial review. The taxpayers were not treated differently than any other appealing taxpayer. The collection of the tax prior to judicial review was not a deprivation of property without due process. The taxpayers had opportunities to challenge the assessment through an informal administrative hearing and a formal quasi-judicial hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the environmental group had standing because one of its members, appearing in a representational capacity, was a landowner near the gravel pit who was &quot;aggrieved&quot; within the meaning of 1979 Or. Laws 772, &sect; 4(3). The court noted that the landowner was more than abstractly dissatisfied with the county's decision and the decision was contrary to the request or other position that he had espoused during the proceeding. Moreover, LUBA's decision was upheld because it was supported by substantial evidence that the expanded operation had a likelihood of damage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayers formed a family trust to cause their income from personal services and income-producing property to be income of the trust, rather than individual income. Taxpayers filed a complaint. The taxpayers' trial counsel appeared on another matter and counsel interpreted remarks of the judge as prejudicial. Her motion to disqualify the judge was denied. The taxpayers also filed suit to reverse a determination of the United States Tax Court concerning the same trust for the same year, which found the taxpayers to be individually liable. The Department of Revenue moved for summary judgment in this case on the basis of collateral estoppel, which was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed. As to disqualification, the taxpayers could not rely on Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14.250 as their motion was not timely. The taxpayers contended that they were deprived of constitutionally protected procedural due process, but did not make allegations of fact that would support a finding of prejudice or bias. As to collateral estoppel, the court found that tax court correctly stated that both courts considered the issue of whether the taxpayers were taxable or whether the trust was taxable.</SPAN></P>

The state fund denied benefits to the claimant because &sect; 656.226 covered only female survivors of covered workers. The claimant challenged, and the court of appeals reversed. The state fund appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 656.226 violated both the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The classifications made in &sect; 656.226 were inherently suspect because they were made on the basis of gender. Section &sect; 656.226 did not overcome this suspicion because the classification did not reflect specific biological differences between men and women. It was based on stereotypes. Therefore, &sect; 656.226 was the kind of classification that could not withstand constitutional challenge. However, the court did not invalidate &sect; 656.226 because to do so would be to deny the claimant and his child benefits. Accordingly, the court affirmed that &sect; 656.226 extended benefits to the claimant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a decision of a court of appeals (Oregon), which affirmed a trial court's order that upheld a search of defendant's purse, including the opening of a coin compartment of a wallet within the purse, conducted without a warrant, after defendant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance. Defendant challenged the search as violating state and federal constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches or seizures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After defendant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance, a police officer took defendant's purse and, on the way to the police station, the officer opened the purse, found a wallet within, opened the coin compartment of the wallet, and found amphetamines. The trial court upheld the search as an inventory search. The lower court upheld the search as incident to defendant's arrest. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the search was incident to a lawful arrest and was therefore an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment and Or. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9. The court held that Oregon no longer followed the federal law regarding the constitutional minimum standard for the protection of privacy in cases of searches incident to arrests and formulated an independent rule consistent with past Oregon decisions, which held that a warrantless search had to be justified by the circumstances surrounding the arrest. Thus, the court held that the search of defendant's purse was justified because it was reasonable to believe under the circumstances that defendant had contraband in her purse and the search was close in time and space to defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 487.560. Following a trial, defendant moved for acquittal. The trial court denied the motion and convicted defendant of the crime charged. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 487.560 and the legislative history indicated that the legislature intended to create a strict liability crime and as such the prosecution was not required to prove a culpable mental state. The court found, however, the legislature allowed a defendant to establish a limited defense that she did receive notice of the suspension of her license as required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 482.570, or that she did not receive notice in accordance with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.560(3)(c). The court determined the limited defense was unavailable if the state could establish that the defendant had actual knowledge of the suspension. The court concluded a provision under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.560(2) that shifted the burden to defendant to establish she did not receive notice of the suspension of her license was not unconstitutional where knowledge of the suspension was not an element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Following defendant's conviction for robbery in a jury trial, the trial court imposed a minimum five-year sentence for the use of a firearm pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610(4), even though the jury did not necessarily find that defendant had personally used or threatened to use a firearm. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Three men robbed the victims. Two carried guns and the other carried a knife. The indictments were worded in such a way that defendant could have been convicted of all of the offenses whether he was carrying one of the guns or the knife. Defendant was convicted on all counts. Defendant's convictions were merged and he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for robbery in the first degree. At the sentence proceeding, the circuit court found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had used or threatened to use a firearm and imposed a five-year minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.610(4). Defendant appealed only that five-year minimum term. The court held that the term was unconstitutional, reversed, and remanded for resentencing. The court stated that the finding by the circuit court, rather than by a jury, of defendant's personal use of a firearm violated his constitutional right to a trial by jury guaranteed by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 because the firearm finding went to the criminal act for which defendant was punished, and thus was closer to an element of the crime than to a characterization of defendant.</SPAN></P>

However, the court held that it could not escape the conclusion that the statute as written reached areas of constitutionally privileged expression and thus was invalid unless its coverage was narrowed to exclude these areas. The court further held that in the case of this statute the needed narrowing could not be accomplished by judicial interpretation.

L. No. 93-100, 87 Stat. 347 (1973), as constitutional in favor of respondent taxpayer, a savings and loan association. The Department had assessed a deficiency after the taxpayer filed a corporate excise tax return stating that it earned no taxable income in Oregon pursuant to the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer had filed an Oregon corporate excise tax return with the defendant Department stating that it earned no taxable income in Oregon, and the Department assessed a deficiency. The Department sought to have the statute exempting the &quot;doing business&quot; state tax held the unconstitutional, contending that the statute was beyond the powers granted to Congress. The taxpayer contended that Congress was empowered to act either under its admitted power to exempt &quot;federal instrumentalities&quot; from state taxation or under its power to regulate Commerce among the several states under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court upheld the judgment granted to the taxpayer. Congress was empowered to act by the Commerce Clause. There was a &quot;rational basis&quot; for Congress to believe that states' &quot;doing business&quot; taxes levied on concerns such as the taxpayer were on activities in interstate commerce or activities affecting interstate commerce. The exemption only applied to the taxing of depositories that had their principal office in another state. It was rational to conclude that the spatial arrangement probably would have involved or affected transactions and the flow of property across state lines.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant's conviction was based on a statement defendant made after the officer had formed, but not communicated, his intention to arrest defendant. The court held that the statement was the product of custodial interrogation and should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">When defendant was stopped by the arresting officer, he was given field sobriety tests. Afterward, the officer determined that he was going to arrest defendant for driving while under the influence of intoxicants. The officer had not yet communicated that intention to defendant, when he asked defendant to rate himself on a scale of intoxication of 0 to 10, 0 being not intoxicated and 10 being extremely intoxicated. Defendant responded that he was a &quot;low five&quot; and that he should not have been driving and should have let another passenger drive. On appeal, defendant challenged the admission of his statements on grounds that it violated his 5th and 14th Amendment rights because he had not first received Miranda warnings. The court agreed with the state's assertion that the Miranda definition of custody referred to restrictions of greater magnitude and apparent duration than exist in an ordinary investigative traffic stop such as defendant's. Therefore, the court concluded that the statements in issue were properly admitted because they were the product of noncustodial questioning and because there was no evidence of the statements' involuntariness in the totality of the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer contested that the application of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.1110 on two grounds. First, the taxpayer argued that principles of statutory construction must be applied to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.110 to effectuate the policy underlying the statutory scheme, namely, maximization of the common school fund. Second, the taxpayer challenged the validity of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.110 under the Oregon Const. art. VIII, &sect; 5, requiring that common school funds be managed with the object of obtaining the greatest benefit for the people of Oregon. In affirming, the court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.110 did not violate the Oregon Constitution. The court concluded that when state owned property was used for public purpose it was exempt from taxation, but where public property was used for private purposes, the policy underlying the exemption from taxation no longer applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The public utility had commenced a special proceeding that challenged the validity of a revenue bond election, which resulted in judgments in the public utility's favor.

The appellate court had denied the public utility's motion to expedite the briefs on the appeal. The public utility then filed a writ in mandamus that sought to compel the appellate court to expedite the briefs on the appeal. On appeal, the court found the legislative command to the appellate court for expediting an appeal for special proceedings did not unduly burden or unduly interfere with the judiciary in the exercise of its judicial functions. The court held that the appellate court was in error in disregarding the legislative command in &sect; 261.615 when considering the public utility's motion to expedite. Nonetheless, the court declined to issue the writ in mandamus because to require such an action at this late stage could unduly interfere with the appellate court's schedule.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.540.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state challenged the appeals court's affirmance of the grant of defendant's motion to suppress evidence of a Breathalyzer test. The trial court suppressed the evidence on the basis that defendant was entitled to a telephone call to consult a lawyer before taking the test. The court reversed the appeals court judgment. The court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.540, the drunk driving statute, was an implied consent statute that authorized police to overcome refusal to take the Breathalyzer test by threat of adverse consequences. The court held that &sect; 487.540 was not violated and that there was no violation of defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amends. IV, VI. The court held that defendant's right to counsel did not attach before formal charges were filed. The court also held that the test was a warrantless search, but was reasonable because the fact that the alcohol dissipates constituted exigent circumstances. The court held that defendant's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were violated - in that his general privacy rights to communicate with others, including his attorney, were restricted, but that he was not prejudiced by the error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Department assessed taxes on the railroad's transportation property under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 308.15. The railroad contested the assessment. The trial court generally agreed with the Department's method of computation of the income to be considered, but withheld the entry of its decree pending a recomputation by the Department. The court modified the trial court's decision. The Department's income approach valuation using an annuity technique was not appropriate to the valuation of the railroad's ongoing operations. The income approach was a method of estimating the present worth of benefits to be derived from property in the future. It involved a determination of the present and prospective income from the property, reduced to an indication of value by a mathematical process known as capitalization. Direct capitalization, not based on the life expectancy of the railroad's assets, was appropriate, because the railroad was required to provide reasonably adequate service, equipment, and facilities under &sect; 760.015, and federal law prohibited them from discontinuing service without a governmental determination that such discontinuance was in the public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The people of the state adopted a constitutional amendment to Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 that would assure them of an apportionment of the legislative assembly after each federal census. The amendment provided for review of challenges to a reapportionment measure enacted by the assembly, for preparation of a reapportionment by the Secretary of State if the assembly enacted no reapportionment measure or enacted a faulty one, and for further review by the court of any reapportionment thus prepared by the secretary. The voters challenged 1981 Or. Laws 261 on a variety of grounds, including the formation of a new district by adding some adjoining census tracts to an existing district to meet the new population ratio. The voters argued that the law divided a city and a county into separate legislative districts and that certain residents would not be able to vote in some elections. The court held that the reapportionment complied with the 14th Amendment standards of equal representation, but did not comply with Or. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6(1), and was therefore null and void. The court ordered the secretary to prepare a draft reapportionment and return the draft to the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State sought review of an order of the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which reversed defendant's conviction for possessing a &quot;billy&quot; in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.510(1) on the grounds that &sect; 166.510(1) was unconstitutional under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27, which afforded defendant the right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">At trial, the evidence showed that defendant was stopped by a police officer for driving at an excessive speed whereupon the officer observed a wooden &quot;billy&quot; on the floor of the car. Defendant told the officer that he made the club in a high school shop class and used it to hit people who hassled him. At trial, he argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.510(1) was unconstitutional because it was overbroad, but he did not assert his right to bear arms. The appeals court reversed defendant's conviction, ruling that &sect; 166.510(1) contravened his constitutional right to bear arms. On appeal, the court ruled that under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27, defendant had the right to bear arms, and that right necessarily included the right to possess a &quot;billy.&quot; Thus, the court held, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.510(1) was an impermissible prohibition on defendant's constitutionally protected right to bear arms. The court also ruled that because defendant's argument that &sect; 166.510(1) was overbroad was, in effect, an assertion that the statute swept so broadly as to infringe his constitutional right to possess arms, the appeals court properly considered Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27 and reversed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed.

However, &sect; 163.115 and the aggravated murder statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.105, were not repugnant, thus, the initiative did not impliedly repeal &sect; 163.105.

The court allowed the petitions to consider the basis for appellate jurisdiction and whether a trial by jury was required in the post-conviction forfeiture proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the felon was convicted by a jury for unlawful possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, the district attorney filed a motion under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.247(2) for an order forfeiting a vehicle that allegedly belonged to the felon. The trial court held that a jury trial was not required and, after a hearing, ordered the vehicle forfeited. The court asked the parties to address the basis for appellate jurisdiction in the case. Affirming the court of appeals' judgment, the court found that the forfeiture proceeding was not a criminal action and that the appeal was not from a judgment on a conviction; rather, it was an appeal from a final order affecting a substantial right that was made in a proceeding after judgment or decree and was reviewable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19.010. The court agreed with the court of appeals that the felon was entitled to a jury trial because Or. Const. art I, &sect; 17 required a jury trial in a forfeiture proceeding where issues of fact germane to the forfeiture were not resolved in the underlying criminal action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court enjoined petitioner officials assigning female correctional officers to any position in which the job description or actual duties include frisks or pat-downs of male prisoners, except in emergency situations. The court held that the trial court and the appellate court correctly recognized that prisoners could raise a constitutionally founded objection to a search by corrections officers of the opposite sex that involved touching of sexually intimate body areas even through clothing, pursuant to Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. However, the injunction was improperly phrased by being directed at the positions to which female corrections officers could be assigned. The injunction was modified to enjoin only that guards of the opposite sex may not conduct a &quot;patdown,&quot; &quot;frisk,&quot; or other search of plaintiffs' anal-genital area except in the event that the immediate circumstances in a particular situation necessitate it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">At the time of his arrest, defendant was steering a vehicle being towed by another vehicle on a public highway.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.560. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant petitioned for review, contending that the appellate court erred in rejecting, without discussion, defendant's contention that the vehicle being towed was not a &quot;motor vehicle&quot; for the purposes of &sect; 487.560. The court noted that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 483.014 defined the term &quot;motor vehicle&quot; as any vehicle &quot;which is self-propelled&quot; and concluded that this statute was ambiguous when applied to a situation involving a vehicle under tow. Because the statute in question was penal in nature, the court observed that defendant was entitled to the benefit of the more lenient construction of it. The court concluded that the definition of &quot;motor vehicle,&quot; as applied to persons who steered or braked vehicles under tow, meant a vehicle which was in fact &quot;self-propelled.&quot; Thus, defendant was not driving a &quot;motor vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress was without error and affirmed it. The court held that the warrantless seizure of defendant's car at the time of his arrest was justified by exigent circumstances because the car was partially blocking traffic and it appeared to contain stolen property, which the police were obliged to recover and restore to the owner. However, the court reversed defendant's death sentence because imposition of a greater penalty denied defendant his right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the board's duty at the initial hearing was only to commit or conditionally release the patient. The court noted, as evidence that the board was not required to make an independent finding of dangerousness, that the trial court was required to do so no more than 20 days before the initial hearing, and that either of the board's determinations at the initial hearing were predicated on a previous finding of dangerousness.</SPAN></P>

The inmate filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the denial of her application for security release contravened the governing law and that she was entitled to have the charge against her dismissed because she had been denied a speedy trial. Upon consideration, the court denied the inmate's application. The court found that the inmate was not entitled to a security release under Or. Rev.

Although noting that the inmate had been incarcerated for an extraordinary length of time, the court concluded that the inmate had not been denied a speedy trial. The court found that the inmate herself was responsible for a significant portion of the delay in bringing the matter to trial, that there was no question of bad faith on the part of the prosecution, and that the inmate had failed to prove that the delay had adversely affected her ability to present a viable defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner personal representative brought an action against respondent state for wrongful death and cross-petitioner driver brought a personal injury action against the state following a collision at an intersection that was controlled by a traffic light. The trial court rendered judgment for the personal representative and the driver. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) reversed. The personal representative and driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The personal representative and the driver asserted that the state was liable either because signal lights, at the time of the accident, were malfunctioning or because the arrangement and design of the signals were deceptive to oncoming motorists. The jury returned a verdict for the personal representative and the driver. The appellate court reversed and held that there was no evidence from which the jury could have found that the lights had malfunctioned. On appeal, the court held that: (1) there was evidence from which the jury could have inferred that the lights had malfunctioned and that the state was negligent by not correcting the malfunction; (2) the state and its employees were shielded from liability by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3) for a claim that was based on a discretionary function of government, interpreted as involving policy type decisions; (3) Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.285 required the state to defend and indemnify its employees for tort claims based on their public duties in the absence of aggravated malfeasance; and (4) the burden was on the state to establish its immunity and it had not done so where it conceded that its engineering judgment was negligently exercised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment from the appellate court, which reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the personal representative and the driver in their wrongful death and negligent actions against the state. The court remanded the matter with instructions to reinstate the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The city contended that Or. Rev.

Defendants contended that the restricted right of appeal in cases originating in municipal court denied them equal protection of the laws, and that they were also denied equal protection of the laws because the police had unlimited discretion to prosecute them in municipal court, rather than in district court. The court found that the court of appeals erred in its holding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 221.360, to the extent it provided for a reduced scope of appellate court review, violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.

The court determined that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 496.610 gave the state police the power to enforce wildlife laws. The police set up a roadblock to check hunters' compliance with the laws, check hunting licenses, and to gather statistics. Under Or. Rev.

The court held that the legislature did not intend to limit all stops for law enforcement purposes to those permitted under &sect; 131.615 and that checkpoint stops did not fall under that provision. The court held that the checkpoint did not violate the constitution because the officers did not have unconstrained discretion, and the procedure was effective in meeting its ultimate goal of enforcing hunting laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was involved in a verbal argument with his apartment manager that escalated into name calling, colorful words, and object throwing.

Defendant was charged with and convicted of disorderly conduct and possession of a slugging weapon. The lower appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Although defendant did not raise at trial the contention that his acts did not amount to the crime of disorderly conduct, the court affirmed the disorderly conduct conviction upon determining that defendant's case did not present the exceptional circumstance or manifest error which justified the court's consideration of his claim. The court reversed defendant's conviction for possession of a billy club. The court held that Or. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant claimed the language that defined the offense was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in that it could deter citizens from exercising their right of free expression guaranteed by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court reversed the court of appeals. Section 166.025(1)(c) made the expression or the speaking of certain kinds of language criminal if done intentionally or recklessly to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. The statute did not require that the words spoken actually cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, but made the speaking of the words themselves criminal if spoken with the requisite intent even if no harm was caused or threatened. The statute did restrain freedom of expression of opinion and restricted the right to speak. When the terms of a statute as written prohibited or restrained expression that came within the protection of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, the statute was a law that was forbidden. Freedom of speech did not exclude expressions that were offensive or obscene in the sense of vulgar and the phrase &quot;obscene language&quot; in the statute was not limited to words that appealed to a prurient interest in sex, which would not be protected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, indicted criminal relators, petitioned for a writ of mandamus to mandate that defendants, circuit judge and district attorney, conduct a preliminary hearing or dismiss the charges. Defendants asserted that mandamus was not a proper remedy because relators might have appealed if they were convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Relators contended that direct appeal was not an adequate remedy because they would have been prejudiced in two respects if forced to trial without a preliminary hearing: they would have been denied pretrial discovery of the testimony of a prosecution witness and a pretrial opportunity to determine whether the state had probable cause to require them to answer to the charge. The court concluded that this did not constitute such prejudice as rendered direct appeal a less than adequate remedy and there was an absence of special circumstances, and denied the writ. Relators were not prejudiced by the requirement that they defer review of their claim of denial of discovery until direct appeal, and the prospect of suffering the burden of litigation was not a sufficient injury in itself to justify mandamus. Direct appeal was an adequate remedy unless relator would have suffered a special loss beyond the burden of litigation by being forced to trial. The court held that because direct appeal was a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy for the review of the ruling challenged by relators, mandamus was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court dismissed the alternative writ of mandamus that relators had petitioned for against defendants to require a preliminary hearing or dismissal the charges against them, and denied relief.</SPAN></P>

The CSD terminated the benefit program under a temporary rule, rather than according to procedures prescribed in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.335. The court held that the CSD failed to repeal the program by rule. The trial court awarded monetary relief when the class members specifically requested only a declaratory judgment that the program had not been properly terminated. The court agreed with the court of appeals that monetary relief could not be granted for an administrative agency's failure to comply with rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, Or.

Defendant appealed on the ground that the trial court admitted evidence of a chemical test of her breath that was administered after her arrest and after she was denied permission to telephone her attorney for advice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After her arrest for DUII, police officers advised defendant of her choice whether to submit to a chemical test of her blood alcohol level or to accept a four-month license suspension pursuant to Or.

The court reversed the judgment, determining that the failure to allow the call precluded use of the test results because the state did not obtain the test with defendant's consent. Administration of the breath test was not a civil procedure because a DUII charge was a criminal prosecution. The court held that the defenses available in a license suspension proceeding pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 482.550 for failure to submit to the test and the procedural protections otherwise provided to DUII defendants showed that the legislature intended the choice whether to submit to the test to be an informed one. The legal consequences of the choice were not simple nor within the common knowledge of laymen and the legislature could not have intended to deprive defendants of counsel at the most critical moment in a DUII prosecution.</SPAN></P>

He sought review of the revocation of his Oregon license on the ground of &quot;unprofessional conduct.&quot; The revocation was based on the dentist's act of obtaining malpractice insurance coverage for other dentists employed by him in his California practice by a misrepresentation that they were employed in Oregon. The issue on review was whether the Board could revoke a dentist's license under an unparticularized rubric of &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; upon an administrative finding that he had practiced a fraud on an insurance company. The court reversed, concluding that the dentist was entitled to relief. His license had been revoked under a statutory standard of &quot;unprofessional conduct,&quot; that was broadened beyond its original list of specifications, which the statute meant the Board to particularize by rules. Because there was no such rule made to proscribe the kind of conduct charged against the dentist, there was no legal ground on which to revoke his license.

The county argued that the Department had failed to exhaust its remedies before seeking review from the LCDC. The LCDC agreed and dismissed the case. The appellate court reversed the dismissal and ordered the LCDC to hear the petition. On further review, the court affirmed, holding that the Department was not required to exhaust remedies because the LCDC had not promulgated such a rule. Further, the legislature had not enacted a law requiring exhaustion. The court did not read the condition into the statutes because exhaustion as a precondition to review by the LCDC was not plainly desirable for accomplishing the legislative purpose. The legislative history of the statute and the function of the LCDC as a monitor of land use decisions also supported the idea that exhaustion could not be read into the statute.</SPAN></P>

He filed motions for permission to argue his cases orally before the lower court. The lower court citing its internal rule that where a litigant represented himself no oral argument was permitted by any party to the matter, denied his motions and ordered the cases submitted without oral argument. The litigant then brought a mandamus proceeding, claiming that he had a statutory right to argue his own case or, alternately, that such right existed under Or. Const., art I, &sect; 20. The court rejected the litigant's arguments. The court first pointed out that the lower court's rule fell within the authority granted to the lower court by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2.560(6), which authorized the lower court to enact rules that facilitated the processing of appeals before it. The court then found that the Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The radiologist was excellent in his work but his inability to work with others jeopardized patient care. The radiologist sought an order restoring his staff privileges and enjoining the hospital from future actions unless it complied with due process and hospital bylaws. The radiologist also sought compensatory and punitive damages, attorney fees, and costs. Before trial, the lower court granted the hospital partial summary judgment on the due process issues. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court concluded that the hospital had complied with its bylaws and that there was a basis in fact for the hospital's suspensions. Further, the court held that Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 did not apply to private entities but that the radiologist might have been entitled to common law fair procedure. Without adopting the rule, the court assumed the proposition to decide the instant case and concluded that the hospital adhered to its bylaws which the radiologist agreed to when he accepted staff privileges. The court found that the hospital's decision was made by persons trained in healthcare and that there was no reason for upsetting the decision so long as there was a rationale for it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Both the circuit court and the court of appeals held that the writ of review was not available to review decisions of the district court as an &quot;inferior court&quot; after 1975 Or. Laws 611 made the district court a court of record whose judgments were directly appealable to the court of appeals. The court disagreed and overturned the decision of the court of appeals. At issue was whether circuit court review of district court decisions by means of the writ of review was meant to survive and coexist with the creation of direct appeals from the district court to the court of appeals. The court held that before the enactment of Chapter 611, review by writ of review coexisted with direct &quot;appeals&quot; from the district court to the circuit court. If that was the deliberate legislative policy when an appeal was available to the circuit court, the court held that it was not justified in reading that policy out of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.040 when the appeal was shifted to the court of appeals. Thus, the circuit court retained jurisdiction to entertain the petition for a writ of review in this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of an order from the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed a circuit court's judgment that convicted defendant of kidnapping, coercion, menacing, sexual abuse, four counts of sodomy, and illegal possession of a firearm and that imposed sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was indicted on separate counts of the charged crimes, all arising as part of the same act and transaction, involving one 12-year-old victim during a period of several hours. The circuit court sentenced defendant to 20 years' imprisonment for each count of sodomy and five years on the sexual abuse charge, with the sentences to run concurrently and in addition to consecutive terms imposed for the other charges. Defendant, on appeal, argued that some of the counts should have been merged in the judgments of conviction and sentence. The court of appeals declined to consider the contention on the ground that it had not been adequately raised in the circuit court. The court, in reversing a part of the imposed sentence, agreed that the charge of sexual abuse should have been merged in the conviction for sodomy because the completion of the sodomy offense, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.405, necessarily included the acts that constituted sexual abuse under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.425. The court concluded that merger did not apply to the kidnapping, menacing, and weapons charges, however, because each of the offenses could have been committed without commission of the other two.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner was cited with speeding, a Class C traffic infraction. The district judge refused to schedule a hearing before petitioner posted bail. The court of appeals held that it was unable to reach the merits of the case because 1975 Or. Laws ch. 611, which made district courts courts of record and divested circuit courts of appellate review of district courts, had the effect of divesting circuit courts of authority not only to review district court actions by writ of review, but also to issue writs of mandamus to district courts. The court disagreed, finding that, upon application of the &quot;limited jurisdiction&quot; test, Oregon district courts, with their limited jurisdiction, were &quot;inferior&quot; to Oregon circuit courts, which were courts of general and unlimited jurisdiction. Thus, the circuit court had jurisdiction in the mandamus proceeding. On the merits, the court held that petitioner, by choosing to appear personally before the judge at the time and place stated in the citation, was entitled to have the matter scheduled for hearing at a date to be set at that time by the judge, regardless of whether the judge had the power to require such a driver to post bail.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed for defendant holding that a warrant was necessary where there were no exigent circumstances, and in this case, there were no exigent circumstances present. The court held that because there were no exigent circumstances and the state failed to meet their burden of showing substantial probable cause existed, the police were not justified in failing to get an arrest warrant.</SPAN></P>

The corporation, a business engaged in the car rental business, filed an action to have the tax declared invalid. On appeal, the court vacated the appellate court's dismissal of the action and affirmed the trial court's decision that sustained the validity of the tax. The court found that the corporation did have sufficient standing to bring the action because the terms of the tax ordinance in question required the corporation to collect taxes and maintain records of taxes. The court rejected the corporation's arguments that alleged that the county did not follow the proper procedures for enacting the tax because the specific authority that the corporation cited did not apply to the tax that was at issue. The court determined that the tax was not invalid for lack of an apportionment formula because there was no proof that the tax would result in double taxation. The court concluded that the tax did not impermissibly discriminate against interstate commerce because there was no proof that the tax would have had the effect of differential treatment on visitors and residents of the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants contended that &quot;fundamental fairness&quot; required that recordation be allowed because it was the only reliable means of preserving the grand jury testimony and because, in order to exercise their constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, confrontation of witnesses, and due process of law, such testimony had to be preserved to the extent that it might be a basis for impeachment of the testimony of witnesses at the trial. Defendants contended that recordation would not invade or detract from the secrecy of the grand jury or hamper the prosecution in presenting evidence to the grand jury and that because the prosecutor already enjoyed the right to record grand jury testimony, to deny the same privilege to defendants violated fundamental fairness and equal protection of law. The court dismissed the writ and held as follows: (1) there was no constitutional requirement that grand jury proceedings be recorded; (2) the mere failure to record grand jury testimony did not violate defendants' constitutional rights; and (3) ORS 135.855 provided that such recordings were not to be subject to discovery except for recordings of statements made by defendants.</SPAN></P>

The circuit judge denied defendant's motion. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to require the circuit judge to record the grand jury testimony. Defendant claimed that recording the testimony would not compromise the secrecy of the proceedings, that the State's recording of defendant's testimony for impeachment purposes without the recording of other witnesses denied him equal protection of the law and due process, that recordation was required to protect defendant's rights to confrontation of witnesses, and that the denial of the motion to record the testimony was an abuse of discretion.

Defendant also claimed that the results of the blood tests were inadmissible because there was no showing that the technician had a permit as required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.815. The court rejected these claims and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that in this situation, where defendant was hospitalized in serious condition, his consent to the blood test was irrelevant, and that the taking of the blood test did not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure. The court further held that there was probable cause based on the officers' determinations that defendant smelled and appeared as if he had consumed alcohol. In addition, the court held that the evanescent nature of the alcohol in defendant's blood provided exigent circumstances, and that there was no need to make an arrest before drawing defendant's blood. In addition, although the lab technician did not have a permit, the court held that her testimony was competent and properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

According to neighbors several men fitting the description of the thieves lived in the house. The owner of the car and a friend were in the house when the police arrived, but defendant and his alleged accomplices were not. The car was towed to the police station and searched. The police did not attempt to get a warrant for the search of the car or house. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized from the car. The court of appeals affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress but remanded for a new trial based on unrelated errors. The court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress because probable cause and exigent circumstances existed. The court found exigent circumstances because of the distinct possibility that the car or the evidence would be moved before the police obtained a search warrant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court determined that the trial court properly instructed the jury that if a firearm was pointed at another within firing range, the jury was permitted, but not required, to infer that the firearm was loaded. That instruction did not unconstitutionally place the burden on defendant to negate the distinguishing element of first degree robbery and to sacrifice his privilege not to testify. The burden to prove that the firearm was loaded remained upon the State, because the jury was not required to find that the firearm was loading merely because it was pointed at another within firing range. However, the State was not required to prove that fact by direct evidence that the gun was loaded, but could seek to prove that fact by indirect evidence, just as it could ordinarily prove any element of a crime by indirect evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Oregon), which affirmed his conviction of a burglary and theft at a home where he allegedly had been doing yard work. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court should have suppressed the victim's identification of him at trial because the circumstances of the pretrial photographic identification were so suggestive as to destroy its reliability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant and an accomplice were alleged to have solicited yard work at the victim's house and, under the premise of using the restroom, were alleged to have taken several valuables from the victim's home and fled. Seven months after the crime, the victim identified defendant from a photographic array. The court concluded that two elements of the identification process must be characterized as suggestive. One was the officer's statement to the victim that the suspect was one of the persons pictured. The second suggestive element was the fact that only one of the pictures showed a man with facial hair beyond a mustache. In her report of the incident, the victim made a particular point of one suspect's &quot;Vandyke&quot; beard. Only one of the photographs featured a man with such a beard. The court concluded that the evidence of the victim's identification should have been suppressed by the trial court. Because the victim did not make the photographic identification until seven months after the crime and because her identification of defendant was not, by her own admission, very positive, the court concluded that the error had been prejudicial and required reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court held that defendant was entitled to a new trial and reversed and remanded his conviction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court refused to permit introduction of defendant's mental disease as to his claim of partial responsibility. The same exact evidence as to defendant's mental disease was introduced into evidence anyway as part of defendant's insanity defense pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.295(1). The trial court did not err in refusing to give a jury instruction that &quot;tracked&quot; Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.300. The court held that the statute was an evidence statute and did not apply to jury instructions. In addition, the instruction was in terms of defendant's &quot;intent.&quot; This meant it was not relevant to the crime for which defendant was indicted and tried. The indictment referred to defendant's knowledge, not his intent, two distinct concepts under the state's criminal code. Thus, the proposed instruction was not appropriate.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 119.005(2) should not be applied to a 1974 gift to her son, who was 21 when he was adopted in 1972. The Oregon Tax Court ruled that the amendment did apply. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The 1973 amendment, which took effect before the gift was made, provided that if an adopted person was 21 years or older at the time of his adoption, any transfer of property to him within three years after the adoption was subject to additional or collateral gift tax. The taxpayer argued that the amendment retroactively affected the adoptee's status in relation to the taxpayer and as such was unconstitutional. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument. It stated that the amendment did not change any relationship, rights, and obligations between the taxpayer and the adoptee; rather, only the taxpayer's gift tax obligations were affected. Moreover, the court stated, because the amendment applied only to gifts made after the effective date of the amendment, the taxpayer's due process rights were not violated, as they might have been had the Department attempted to impose the collateral tax upon gifts made before the effective date. The court added that although the taxpayer argued that imposition of the collateral tax violated the Equal Protection and Privileges and Immunities Clauses, she had not cited any United States Supreme Court authority to support her argument.</SPAN></P>

The cities filed a petition for rehearing. In adhering to its former decision and reaffirming the constitutional validity of the challenged laws, the court found that the cities' petition failed to address the validity of the retirement and insurance requirements. The court stated that it was possible for the state legislature to grant local governments certain powers to act on their own without limiting the legislatures' powers. The court reasoned that the ability of a city to legislate its own matters where a state legislature could also act was essential in order for there to be room for potential state legislation. The court interpreted the constitutional amendments as safeguarding the powers of self-government. The court also stated that the amendments did not take away the legislature's power to enact purely local laws.</SPAN></P>

The only reason defendant was stopped was because the bartender noticed a large amount of cash and because defendant kept looking at the police officer. After defendant explained why he had the money, the police officer was no longer suspicious about it. A jury had convicted defendant after the trial court denied his motion to suppress evidence seized by the police in a warrantless search of his person and automobile. The court first noted that neither the appellate court nor it was bound by the implicit conclusion of the trial court that defendant's compliance with a police officer's request for identification was voluntary. The court held that all the circumstances showed that defendant was seized because there was a temporary restraint of his liberty by the police officer, there was no valid consent to that restraint, and because it was not based upon reasonable suspicion on the part of the police officer, it was not authorized by Or.

The affidavit did not allege that it was made in good faith. The court rejected the justice's contention that the affidavit was required to allege that it was made in good faith, observing that it had never held that an allegation of good faith was constitutionally required in a motion to recuse a judge, but only that the legislature could not confer upon parties the peremptory power to recuse a judge. The court held that all the affiant was required to do was come forward with some evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that the trial judge's impartiality was in question. The court concluded that it need not decide whether the factual allegations made by the litigant were contestable, because the justice of the peace conceded that the affidavit's allegations were true.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An Illinois corporation sought to quash service on the following grounds: (1) The first cause of action, in contract, did not arise out of the transaction of business within Oregon pursuant to Or.

The court rejected these contentions, finding in view of the court's commitment to interpret the Oregon long-arm statute as broadly as constitutional due process will permit, and upon a consideration of this entire transaction, the Illinois corporation did engage in the transaction of business within this state for the purposes of Or.

The county adopted the 1973 plan which designated various parcels of the subject property &quot;medium density residential,&quot; &quot;neighborhood commercial,&quot; &quot;greenway area,&quot; and &quot;transit station.&quot; The owner was denied a building permit under Ordinance 125. On appeal of the lower court's decision finding the 1973 plan invalid, the court held that Or. Rev.

The county charter then did not require that a comprehensive plan be enacted by ordinance. The court held (1) the 1973 plan was validly adopted; (2) the owner had not stated a cause of action for inverse condemnation; and (3) the owner's claim that the zoning ordinance and 1973 plan were arbitrary and capricious as applied to its property was subject to the exhaustion doctrine.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the relief requested, but its decree was reversed by the appeals court, which held that the owners' structure was not a trailer house under the definition in the Ordinance and, thus, was an outright permitted use. Upon further review, the court held that the appeals court erred in determining that the owners' structure was not a trailer house as defined by the Ordinance because a building was a trailer house within the meaning of the Ordinance if it was designed to be manufactured in such a manner that it could be moved from one location to another, and, thus, such a structure, being expressly excluded from the definition of single-family dwelling, was not an outright use permitted in the owners' zoning district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The debtor brought suit in circuit court for a declaratory judgment to invalidate a prior judgment against her obtained by a collection agency in small claims court. Her complaint attacked that judgment on constitutional grounds that the law did not give parties the absolute right to have counsel participate in trials of small claims. The debtor's attempted appeal from the order denying her motion for a default judgment was dismissed by the circuit court because the order was not appealable. She then obtained a judgment from the circuit court dismissing her case with prejudice and she appealed and asserted that the discretionary allowance of appearance by counsel was insufficient because an expression of the need for legal representation could, itself, require the assistance of counsel. The court found that nothing prevented a litigant from consulting counsel in advance of a hearing in small claims court and, if so advised, to submit to the small claims court a request prepared by counsel that counsel be permitted to appear. The debtor had consulted counsel but did not submit an appearance request. The court concluded that the circuit court did not err in dismissing her suit.</SPAN></P>

S&amp;L argued that federal law pre-empted the state law regarding use of such funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Borrower filed an action for an accounting of earnings on funds deposited with the S&amp;L for payment of taxes and insurance on the dwellings secured by the mortgages.

S&amp;L claimed that state common law of agency and trusts, as it affected such deposits, was pre-empted by the federal Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1461 et seq. The trial court certified borrower as representative of a plaintiff class and ordered an accounting. On appeal, the court concluded that the type of state regulation sought to be imposed here was not preempted by any federal law or regulation until an amended regulation, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 545.6-11(c), required payment of interest on such funds. That regulation took effect after this action was filed and was not retroactive. The court affirmed the certification of borrower as class representative and modified the order for an accounting so that it terminated when the amended federal regulation took effect. The court also held that the doctrines of laches and waiver did not bar borrowers' claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner state medical association brought an original action, naming the state insurance commissioner as respondent, seeking a declaration of the constitutionality of Oregon's new medical malpractice legislation. Both parties sought to uphold its constitutionality in the action brought pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 752.190, which was enacted as part of the legislation and gave the court jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Oregon's legislature had twice acted to solve the medical malpractice problem. Two years earlier the court had held that no justiciable controversy existed in an action brought by the association against the commissioner where both sought to uphold the statute's validity. In its second attempt, the legislature enacted &sect; 752.190, which gave the association, the commissioner, or any interested party the right to bring an original action to determine the validity of the legislation, and a justiciable controversy would then be deemed to exist. The court had no problem with the grants of jurisdiction and standing. However, it held that a justiciable controversy could not just be deemed to exist. The court could not decide the constitutionality of the statute in the abstract against all of the possible constitutional challenges that might be made. Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 2 required an actual case or controversy. There was no controversy here. Both parties wanted the legislation declared constitutional. The court declined to give an advisory opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the validity of a state law depended on the limitations imposed by the Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2. The cities had the right to local self-government. Thus, at issue was whether the retirement provisions were addressed primarily to a concern of the state with the modes of local government or to substantive social, economic, or other regulatory objectives. The court held that the retirement provisions embodied a legislative social concern to secure the postemployment living standards of police officers, firemen, and their families. The retirement provisions did not compel local administration. The cities' employees were not beyond the reach of the state's social legislation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the nonlawyer's motion for summary judgment, his motion challenging equity jurisdiction, and his motion for a change of judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The nonlawyer admitted practicing law in the past and stated that he intended to practice law in the future and to charge a fee for his services. He argued that he had the right, as a matter of free enterprise, to practice law and that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by enjoining the violation of a criminal statute. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, with modifications. The court held that the state restricted the practice of law and many other professions to those who were properly qualified in order to protect the public. The court found that the injunction was an appropriate remedy because it provided more adequate protection of the public interests than a criminal prosecution for each separate violation would provide. The court found that the trial court erred in holding that the nonlawyer could only appear in civil cases in justice court because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 52.060, which allowed any person to act as attorney for another in a justice's court, did not distinguish between criminal and civil cases. The court also held that under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 51.300, a nonlawyer could appear before a district judge who was sitting as a justice of the peace.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court ordered that the decree enjoining the nonlawyer from practicing law should be amended to provide that the nonlawyer could appear as counsel in any civil or criminal case in a justice court or as counsel in a civil or criminal case in any municipal court that authorized such appearances by city charter or code. The court affirmed the decree of permanent injunction as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Petitioner was charged with first offense DUII, a &quot;traffic infraction&quot; as distinguished from a &quot;traffic crime&quot; under Or.

The court considered the magnitude of the fine, the non-payment sanctions, the relationship of DUII to other major traffic offenses, and the retention of criminal law enforcement procedures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, described as agitated and out of control, burned down a Planned Parenthood Center after having complaining about abortions. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to give his requested instruction on diminished intent or partial responsibility under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.305. First, the court rejected the Court of Appeals' determination that the fact that the statute placed the burden of proving diminished intent on defendant did not make the statute unconstitutional. Instead, the court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.305 was unconstitutional insofar as it placed the burden of proving partial responsibility or diminished intent on defendant. However, any error in failing to give an instruction on the issue of partial responsibility was not prejudicial because the trial court instructed the jury that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the material elements of the indictment including an intent to injure the property. The only real issue in this case concerned defendant's responsibility for his actions, and it was clear that his intent was to damage the building of another by starting a fire or causing an explosion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The real estate broker prepared six documents, including four contracts of sale, a quitclaim deed, and a warranty deed to assist his client, a seller, in the conveyance of real property. The Oregon State Bar filed an action against the broker alleging a violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9.160 and seeking to enjoin his activities. The trial court granted the request for injunction and precluded the broker from, among other things, selecting documents for his clients which conveyed title to real property or which affected rights in real property, preparing such documents unless acting as a mere scrivener, and exercising any judgment in the preparation of such documents. The broker sought review. On appeal, after reviewing the testimony, the court determined that the State Bar had failed to offer sufficient evidence to show that the broker either selected the forms to be used or was responsible for the choice of any of the words used in filling out the forms, so that the broker acted other than as a mere scrivener.</SPAN></P>

The pedestrian was injured when she was hit by the driver's vehicle. The driver claimed that the pedestrian was a passenger and was being &quot;transported&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 30.115. On appeal, the court disagreed. The court held that the pedestrian was not being &quot;transported&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 30.115 because she had made no voluntary contact with the vehicle prior to the accident. The court construed &sect; 30.115 and found that to apply &sect; 30.115 under the circumstances by which the pedestrian was injured would have extended &sect; 30.115 beyond the correction of evils that were the inducing reasons for its enactment.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer did not prove an arbitrary and systematic discrimination or that widespread relative non-uniformity existed. The court agreed that the lands involved were unimproved sagebrush identical to some lands that were classified as 5-3-1 &quot;farm use&quot; property; however, that was not necessarily controlling. Rather, ORS 308.205 and ORS 308.232 required that all land be assessed at 100 percent of its true cash value. The court held that the best evidence of such value is normally the market data based upon actual sales of the same property.

The court sought to resolve issues concerning the nature of the commissioner's discretion over civil penalties and the scope of judicial review. The court found that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 767.470(4) authorized the commissioner to grant mitigation on &quot;such terms&quot; as he considered proper, which suggested that he was granted a range of administrative discretion to identify the factors so as to lead to a rational evaluation of the facts in a specific case. The court reversed the judgment that further reduced the penalties and remanded the case because no statute authorized the appellate court to substitute its judgment on the reasonableness of the commissioner's properly articulated order.

The court affirmed, finding that the statute provided that the debtors' homestead was exempt from sale on execution and that the exemption was not automatic and had to be affirmatively asserted before the sale or it was lost. As the exemption applied to the sale on execution, the appropriate time to measure the value of the exemption was at the time of the sale on execution. Under the terms of the statute in effect at the time of the sale, the debtors were entitled to the increased homestead exemption. The court also concluded that any indirect contractual impairment which occurred as a result of the increased homestead exemption was not unconstitutional because the increase was reasonable and any impairment was not substantial when balanced against the governmental objective being pursued.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 469.470, the council was required to establish standards, including standards of ability to finance, construct, and operate the facility. The court reversed the affirmance of the council's order, remanded to the council for further proceedings, and held that the council purported to adopt some standards as rule in advance of the proceeding at issue, however, those rule were phrased as demands for information that the power plant had to supply under Or.

The court further held that it was the council's responsibility to decide whether to treat all demands as needs under the Act as a matter of policy and that the council had failed to adopt such a policy.

The medical association and the physician appealed the trial court's finding that the statutes' indemnity provisions were unconstitutional as well as its finding that a physician was not personally immune from claims for indemnity in excess of his professional liability insurance coverage. The hospitals, the clinic, and the citizens cross-appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that (1) there were insufficient facts in the record which pointed to the immediacy of injury; (2) the factual data submitted did not provide the court with a sound footing to decide the constitutional issues raised; and (3) there had to be an actual controversy existing between adverse parties in order to obtain a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The claimant was injured and filed a claim for compensation. It was denied on the basis that it had been untimely filed. This ruling was sustained on appeal. The claimant filed the identical claim a second time. The board found it barred by res judicata. The trial court remanded the action. The employer sought a writ of mandamus directed to the trial court to vacate that decision. The court disallowed the requested peremptory writ. The court found that the threshold problem was whether the retroactive provision of the amendment to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.319 was intended to include those claims which had been previously litigated and which were held untimely filed under the law then in existence. The court found that res judicata did not preclude the second claim. The statutory language, &quot;all claims,&quot; was broad enough to cover such claims, but did not specifically mention claims in which untimeliness had been previously adjudicated. The employer also alleged that the extension of the retroactive provision was a violation of the separation of powers. The court found that it did not have to decide the question. Workmen's compensation claims were part of an exclusively legislative plan.</SPAN></P>

The original decree ordered the removal of a large cross from a municipal park. The trial court dismissed the complaint. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) affirmed. Plaintiffs sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court noted that the original decree was entered after the trial court held that the city had violated the state and federal constitutions by authorizing the erection of the cross. The court further noted that the cross was never removed because the voters of the city approved a charter amendment, accepting the cross as a memorial or monument to United States war veterans. Individual defendants, who were the plaintiffs in the original action, denied the allegations of change of circumstances and alleged affirmative defenses of res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court held that res judicata and collateral estoppel were not defenses in the proceeding under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16.460(1). The court applied the test for determining whether the charter amendment was constitutional under the Establishment Clause, and determined that the charter amendment reflected a clearly secular legislative purpose, that it had a primary effect that neither advanced nor inhibited religion, and that it avoided excessive government entanglement with religion. Therefore, the court held that the charter amendment was constitutional. Accordingly, the court reversed the intermediate court's order.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff gave defendant necessary notice to vacate and commenced eviction proceedings. Trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiff. The court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that lease contained an implied term requiring lessor to offer a renewal on reasonable terms in absence of good cause for termination of the relationship. The court also held that although periodic renewals of a lease could give rise to expectations by the tenant that renewal was likely in the future, this was insufficient to create an obligation to renew.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A county district attorney was accused of unethical conduct in refusing to plea bargain with 15 criminal defendants on the same basis as previously offered to another criminal defendant as long as they were represented by either of their two attorneys. The complaint of the Oregon State Bar charged that the conduct was improper and unethical in that it was prejudicial to the administration of justice, it served merely to harass or maliciously injure another, deprived the defendants their right to the assistance of counsel of their own choice, and encouraged the continuance of criminal actions or proceedings from motives of passion or interest. The court determined that the district attorney's conduct violated Or. Code Prof. Resp.

The court found that the district attorney's conduct fell within the plain language and intent of Or. Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-102(A)(1) and that the terms of Or. Code Prof. Resp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employer sought to terminate the employee and the PERB affirmed his dismissal.

The appellate court also held that the employee was entitled to lost wages and benefits, but refused to grant such relief. Both parties appealed. The court reversed the appellate court and remanded the matter. The court concluded that, in addition to his full post-termination hearing, the employee: (1) should have been notified of the charges against him; (2) should have been informed of the kinds of sanctions being considered; and (3) should have been given at least an informal opportunity to refute the charges either orally or in writing before someone authorized either to make the final decision a recommendation thereon. Because none of the safeguards were provided, the procedures employed did not comply with due process and the employee's dismissal was invalid.

The court found that: (1) the Oregon Building Authority (Authority) had no purpose other than to serve the state in a manner in which the state was prohibited from serving itself; (2) there was no independent business justification for the Authority's existence aside from its ability to borrow money; (3) the Authority's only function was to effectuate the creditor-debtor relationship which existed in fact between the bondholders and the state, the state being the sole source of funds; (4) the relationship in fact was one between the bondholders and the state; and (5) the state's role in the arrangement was retiring a debt which had been incurred on its behalf and which it had the sole responsibility to repay. The court determined that the Act violated Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, which limited the state's indebtedness to $ 50,000.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court rejected the parents' assertion that education was a fundamental interest in Oregon subject to the strict scrutiny level of review because the correct analysis was under the balancing test. The court found that the poorest districts were not totally depriving children of an education and the only objective of school financing was local control of schools. Poorer districts were not without local control simply because they had less funds to control. The court found that local control was accentuated in the home rule provisions of Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2 and Or. Const. art VI. The fact that other systems might provide better financing and local control was not a basis for rendering the system invalid. The court found that the uniformity clause of Or. Const. art. VIII was applied to the provision of minimum educational opportunities, which the state had met.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The county passed an ordinance imposing a tax on all documents transferring real property that were tendered for recording in the county's public records. That ordinance included an emergency clause. Despite that emergency clause, a referendum petition was filed and the ordinance was defeated by the voters at the next general election. The county initiated this action to collect the unpaid tax, arguing the emergency clause prevented the voters from defeating the tax. The trial court held for the potential tax obligors, but the lower appellate court reversed that decision and ordered judgment be entered for the county. The lower appellate decision essentially nullified the election defeating the county's ordinance. This appeal ensued. The court found that the county was a home rule county. The court further found that the voters of home-rule counties had a right under the Oregon Constitution to a referendum on all ordinances regulating taxation. Ore. Const. art. VI, &sect; 10 and art. IX, &sect; 1a applied to home rule counties as well as the state legislature. The voters were entitled to their referendum power, so the county's tax was properly defeated by the general election.</SPAN></P>

The boy scouts alleged that the legislative history of the Act demonstrated that its purpose was to bar discrimination in businesses which offered goods or services to the public and that the legislature did not intend to force organizations like the boy scouts to change long established membership policies. The trial court granted the boy scout's demurrer on the grounds that the mother's complaint failed to state a cause of action. The court affirmed. The term, &quot;place or service,&quot; was ambiguous; thus, the court considered the Act's legislative history. The primary concern and purpose of the legislature in its enactment of the Act was to prohibit discrimination by business or commercial enterprises which offered goods or services to the public.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owner's amended complaint alleged two causes of suit: (1) that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 607.304 was unconstitutional; and (2) that the arbitration proceedings under that statute were fatally defective. The court held that the question presented for decision by the pleadings at the time of this order by the trial court was not whether the statute was constitutional or unconstitutional, but whether the owner was barred by laches, waiver, or estoppel from contending that it was unconstitutional. Accordingly, the court held that the trial court should have decided the question of laches, waiver, and estoppel before undertaking to decide the constitutional question. The court concluded that the trial court also erred in sustaining the demurrer to the owner's second amended complaint and in dismissing that complaint with prejudice because the owner as the objecting party was entitled to seek the aid of a court of equity to stay the proceedings until the disqualified arbitrator had been properly replaced and to declare that any previous acts by the an arbitrator were invalid. Accordingly, the court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the action for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The motion was based upon an affidavit by defendant's attorney alleging that the judge was prejudiced against defendant and his attorney. The court granted defendant's motion. The controversy between the judge and the attorney was long standing, and during it the attorney had filed approximately 26 motions and affidavits of prejudice against the judge. To support his affidavit, the attorney testified to hearsay among lawyers about the judge's bias against criminal defendants and his personal experience with the judge. An attorney who in good faith filed a motion for a change of judge in Oregon was not required to prove actual prejudice by the judge. When a judge was challenged in good faith in any given case for bias or prejudice he was not to sit in that case. An affidavit by the attorney was sufficient without an affidavit by the client. An affidavit of prejudice did not have to state specific facts. A motion for change of judge, if in good faith, could not be denied because of previous abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">This was an original proceeding brought by petitioner builder, pursuant to Or. Laws ch. 97, &sect; 2 (1975), to determine the constitutionality of provisions of the Oregon Housing Act, ORS 456.550 to 456.720, including ch. 97, &sect; 2, and ORS 456.720, which allowed the legislature to appropriate funds to restore debt service reserves for low-income housing bonds. Respondent administrator would not issue bonds without a determination of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">An earlier version of ORS 456.720 had been held to violate Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, insofar as the statute's mandate that the legislature restore debt service reserves for low-income housing bonds created a debt of the state in excess of $ 50,000. The legislature had amended ORS 456.720 to substitute &quot;may&quot; for &quot;shall,&quot; the word that had earlier been construed as a mandate. The court held that the statute as amended did not violate the constitutional limitation on state debt because, at most, it provided for an unenforceable moral obligation on the state's part. The court also held that Or. Laws ch. 97, &sect; 2 (1975), which authorized it to exercise original jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment, did not violate Or. Const. art. VII (amended), &sect; 2. The statute contemplated resort to the court by parties who were in fact engaged in a controversy over the Housing Act's constitutionality, a judicial function regularly performed in declaratory judgment proceedings, and the case itself involved an actual controversy between a builder who was aggrieved by the administrator's refusal to issue bonds without a declaration of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The client purchased certain mineral rights from the county. Her opponent, the owner of the surface rights, notified the county that it was exercising its preferential rights under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 275.298. When the county refused the opponent's tender based on Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 275.298(3), the opponent filed for declaratory relief. Section 275.298(3) was declared unconstitutional and the land was found unsuitable for timber development. The law firm allowed the client's appeal to lapse. The client's widower brought a malpractice action against the law firm. The judgment was in favor of the law firm. On appeal, the court reversed. Recovery was only possible if the court would have reversed the trial court's decision on appeal. The court found that it would have done so. The trial court erred in holding &sect; 275.298(3)&nbsp;unconstitutional because the opponent failed to meet its burden of showing no rational basis for treating lands suitable for commercial timber production differently from lands not so suited. In addition, though the evidence was conflicting, there was sufficient evidence from which to conclude that the majority of the land was suitable for timber production.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the passenger contended that her complaint should have been declared sufficient because ORS 30.115 (Oregon) was unconstitutional because the classifications created by the statute denied equal protection of the laws. The court held that the Fourteenth Amendment did not deny States the power to treat different classes of people in different ways. Rather, a classification had to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and should rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. Here, ORS 30.115 (Oregon) distinguished between fare-paying and gratuitous passengers for the purpose of preventing collusive lawsuits and to protect hospitality of ungrateful guests. The court held that the guest passenger statute did not operate to deny the passenger the equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff wife of a deceased passenger, who also was injured in an automobile accident, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court, Umatilla County (Oregon), which directed a verdict for defendant driver. The amended complaint alleged gross negligence on the part of the driver. The wife's motion for leave to amend to allege simple negligence was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The wife's argument that the motion for leave to amend should have been granted because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.115, Oregon's guest passenger statute, was unconstitutional was rejected. The evidence established that the husband and wife were riding in the driver's pick-up truck when it collided with another vehicle while the driver was making a left turn. The driver told a police officer at the scene of the accident that he had slowed before making the turn and used his automatic turn signal, but that he failed to see the oncoming car. The road was dry and a considerable portion of the highway was visible. The wife argued that, considering the driver's opportunity to see the traffic moving on the highway at the time he made his turn, the driver must have been more than ordinarily negligent. The court concluded that the jury could not have reasonably inferred that the driver was grossly negligent as defined by Oregon precedent. At most, the jury could have concluded that the driver failed to maintain a proper lookout. This was insufficient evidence of recklessness or gross negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court allowed the State's motion to deny defendant's motion to suppress on the ground that it failed to conform to Lane County, Or., Cir.

Defendant's convictions were affirmed, and the court granted defendant's petition for review. The court held that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion on the ground that the failed to satisfy the requirements of the Rule 7.015 because defendant's allegation that the search was conducted without benefit of a search warrant was sufficient to shift the burden to the State to establish the legality of the search. The court determined that the trial court's error was harmless error under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.230 and Or. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The lessee leased a commercial building from the lessor. The lessee's guarantor was also the building manager. The lessee claimed error in the denial of his motion to quash out-of-state service on him because he had only four days to prepare for trial and the summons did not indicate he had to answer in that time, thus failing to give adequate notice for jurisdiction, and the time allowed him as a nonresident was so unreasonable as to be a deprivation of due process. The guarantor argued it was error to enter judgment against him because there was a failure of proof regarding non-payment of rent. The court affirmed. This was not a case of an indigent, incompetent, underprivileged, or unrepresented tenant. Tenants were expected to know the terms of their lease, whether they paid their rent, were in possession of the premises, or had received a proper notice to quit. There was no failure of proof as to nonpayment, but rather substantial evidence to support the findings and decision that the obligation had not been met and the lessor was entitled to immediate possession. Nor was there any evidence of &quot;retaliatory eviction&quot; or any other improper purpose.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals held that there was insufficient evidence before the board to establish what activities constituted the duties of a registered nurse in Oregon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The nurse permitted and instructed her daughter to perform and serve as a registered nurse and recommended her as a registered nurse. On appeal, the court held that the Court of Appeals had confused the issues of (1) what evidence was necessary to establish a standard of professional conduct, and (2) what evidence was sufficient to prove that a standard, once established, was breached. The court noted that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 678.021(2) provided that it was unlawful for an unlicensed person to hold oneself out to be a licensed professional nurse and that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 161.220 provided that it was a crime to aid or abet in any criminal act. The court held that the correct standard of judicial review by the circuit court was in former Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owners bought a car on an installment sale contract that the seller sold to the bank. The contract allowed the bank to repossess the car in the event of default or to elect any other legal or equitable remedy. When the owners failed to make payments on the car, the bank notified them of their default and its intent to repossess. The owners said they would surrender the car peaceably if the bank got a court order. The bank then repossessed the car without breach of the peace. The owners sued the bank, alleging that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79.5030, allowing the bank to use self-help, was unconstitutional. The trial court found the bank liable for trespass and conversion. On appeal, the court held that: (1) procedural due process required an opportunity for a hearing before the state authorized its agents to take property, (2) the right to procedural due process did not attach to deprivation of property by private actors, and (3) the enactment of &sect; 79.5030, allowing private self-help repossessions, did not amount to sufficient state involvement in otherwise private acts to constitute state action necessary to invoke due process protections.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 254.590.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The sponsors initiated a referendum campaign. They hired a paid canvasser to conduct a petition drive. The canvasser paid circulators to obtain petition signatures. Thereafter, the trial court found defendants guilty of violating &sect; 254.590. The court of appeals affirmed the convictions, holding that &sect; 254.590 prohibited compensation as to persons who circulated petitions and those who organized and coordinated a referendum. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 254.590 was a reasonable regulation that facilitated the proper exercise of the initiative and referendum. Further, &sect; 254.590 did not place too great a burden on the legitimate exercise of the initiative and referendum powers by the people. Thus, insofar as &sect; 254.590 prohibited the use of paid canvassers to personally solicit signatures, it was a valid regulation permitted by Or. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1. Moreover, contrary to the court of appeals' interpretation, &sect; 254.590 prohibited the payment of compensation only to those who personally solicited or secured signatures on petitions. However, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that the sponsors violated &sect; 254.590 through the acts of the canvasser.</SPAN></P>

The defendants were convicted of the possession of narcotics. The Court of Appeals (Oregon) affirmed. The court granted the petition for review. The issue was whether evidence should have been suppressed because it had been obtained by officers entering the premises without first knocking and announcing their presence and purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A federal undercover agent purchased hashish from one of the defendants. The agent negotiated to buy a large quantity of hashish. The agent was told to come to defendants' apartment to make the purchase. A search warrant was obtained and delivered to a police officer. The agent was admitted to the apartment and was shown a five-pound box of hashish. He left the apartment, ostensibly to get the money, and left the slightly open. The agent gave the signal to go in and arrest. One of the other officers, in plain clothes, stepped inside with a drawn gun and announced that he was a police officer. The other officers entered. The hashish was found. The State did not contend that the officers knocked or announced their presence before they entered. The trial court denied the motion to suppress and convicted defendants. The appellate court affirmed. An otherwise lawful search and seizure accomplished by an entry that was made without an announcement of presence and purpose was not an unreasonable search and seizure within the meaning of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. A trial was a search for the truth and competent evidence was never excluded except for the most compelling reason.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the Secretary had a duty to remove her name pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 249.031(2)(f), 249.221(1)(f) because the successful candidate was disqualified under Or.

The court further determined that while the unsuccessful candidate did not avail himself of the remedy of a circuit court petition, such failure did not prevent the issue of the writ because the right to be vindicated was a public as well as a private one.

The court ruled that it was in the interest of the public that there was a definite end to the possibility of future litigation resulting from past actions, and that it was a permissible constitutional legislative function to balance the possibility of outlawing legitimate claims against the public need that at some definite time there would have been an end to potential litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Oregon's Constitution was amended to require the legislature to reapportion districts following the federal census. If it failed to do so, the Secretary of State was required to do so. When the legislature failed to reapportion after the 1970 census, the Secretary of State submitted a plan which created single-member districts. Petitioners challenged the action, asserting that the Secretary had acted in violation of the apportionment provisions of Or. Const. art IV, &sect; 6 (1) and &sect; 7, which required the districts be apportioned by determining the ideal population for each district by dividing the total population of Oregon by the constitutionally mandated 30 senators and 60 representatives. The Secretary argued that it was impossible to apportion the districts that way because it resulted in some districts being overrepresented and others under-represented as the constitution also required the districts to follow county lines. The court held that to satisfy Equal Protection, the Secretary could create single-member districts in violation of the Oregon Constitution.

The parents claimed that the lower court erred in overruling their demurrer to the petition to terminate their rights on the grounds that the controlling statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.523 (2) (a), was a violation of due process of law and also was unconstitutionally broad, uncertain, and vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Parents whose rights to their child had been terminated by the lower court sought review of that decision. On review, the parents claimed that the controlling statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419.523 (2)(a), was unconstitutional as a violation of due process of law under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States and unconstitutionally broad, uncertain, and vague under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court found that in juvenile court, the proceedings might be more flexible than in a criminal court, but the rights of the parties were not without constitutional protection. The court concluded that even though the statute in question did not specify the exact behavior that would lead to termination of parental rights, the legislature intended that this be conduct detrimental to any major aspect of the child. The court did not find the statute to be unconstitutionally vague. Even so, the court reversed the lower court's decision to terminate parental rights. The court noted the numerous shortcomings of the parents but concluded that their poverty and instability were not seriously detrimental to their child as intended by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant, a mentally handicapped adult daughter, challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court, Coos County (Oregon), which sustained respondent employer's demurrer on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action. The daughter filed a negligence action against the employer following the death of her father. Her mother received workmen's compensation death benefits that did not include an additional amount for the dependent daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">At the time of the workman's death there was no provision in the workmen's compensation statute to include mentally retarded adult children as beneficiaries entitled to a benefit. The man's adult daughter was totally dependent on her parents and unable to provide for herself. She filed a negligence action against her father's employer. On appeal of the judgment entered against her, the court noted that the former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 656.204 and 002 made no provision for additional benefits on behalf of a mentally handicapped child. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.002(4) was amended to provide that such an adult child was to be considered as a child under the age of 18 for the computation of benefits. The revision did not apply to the daughter. The court rejected her argument that a person not considered to be a beneficiary had the right to file a negligence action against a decedent's employer. Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.018 provided the exclusive remedy available to an employee, his beneficiaries, or anyone else otherwise entitled to recover damages from an employer for the employee's injuries or death. It rejected the daughter's claim that the statute violated her right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff's complaint alleged that he was charged with an offense before the municipal court of the city. He contended that the judge was subject to requirements of the Oregon Constitution, Art VII (Amended), &sect; 1, which provided that judges of the supreme and other courts were to be elected by the legal voters of the state or of their respective districts. Plaintiff argued that the judge was appointed by the council of the city, apparently pursuant to ORS 221.140, and that ORS 221.140 was unconstitutional and void as in conflict with the Oregon Constitution, Art VII (Amended), &sect; 1. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that the constitutional requirement that the judges of the supreme and other courts were to be elected was not intended to include judges of municipal courts of cities. Municipal voters had power to provide by a municipal charter that municipal judges were to be appointed by the city council.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff, the Oregon state forester, appealed a judgment from the Douglas County Circuit Court (Oregon) in a negligence action brought under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 477.064--477.085 to recover the fire suppression costs incurred in fighting a large forest fire. A jury returned a verdict for defendant road construction company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Fire investigators, suspecting that the fire was caused by the company's roller emitting sparks, operated and dismantled the roller without the knowledge or consent of the company. The forester brought an action alleging negligence. The company claimed the forester's inspection prevented the company from subsequently conducting relevant tests to demonstrate its freedom from negligence. The trial court granted the company's motion to suppress upon the ground that the search was unconstitutional. After a jury verdict in favor of the company, the forester appealed. On appeal, the Oregon Supreme Court reversed. The court found there was no known need to deter unconstitutional conduct of state employees searching for the cause of a fire, as there was to deter law enforcement officers investigating suspected criminal activity. The court also reasoned that effective remedies, other than exclusion of competent evidence were available. The court held that illegally seized evidence should only be excluded in a criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding and if it was obtained by law enforcement officers investigating criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judge reversed the judgment that suppressed evidence obtained from the fire investigators' search of the construction company's roller. The court held that the trial court was correct in finding against the company on its affirmative defense of contributory negligence. The court remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The plaintiff was a personal injury claimant in an underlying action.

The plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus to set aside the order and the court granted the writ pertaining to the physician's records, finding that the physician-patient privilege established in &sect; 44.040 (1)(d) applied to the physician and his records and precluded the disclosure of those records until waived by the plaintiff offering himself as a witness in the action pursuant to &sect; 44.040 (2). The court denied the writ as to the hospital records, holding that &sect; 441.510 permitted discovery of those records and that the statute was not unconstitutional because the original legislative act in which it was included did not violate the one subject rule of Or.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The district attorney certified the ballot title for a proposed initiative ordinance repealing an excise tax on employers levied by the board of directors of the MTD, a municipal corporation, and restricting the board's taxing powers.

The MTD also claimed that the ballot title was misleading in its emphasis and did not disclose all the effects the measure would have if enacted. The court held that it was without power to determine the validity of the proposed ordinance before its enactment. It would have been improper for the district attorney to refuse to give the measure a title merely because he thought all or portions of it would be invalid if enacted. Nor would it have been proper for him or the court to decide in advance the validity of the measure and incorporate that decision in the ballot title.
