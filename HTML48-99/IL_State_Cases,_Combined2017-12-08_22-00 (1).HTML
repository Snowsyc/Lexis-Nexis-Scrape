On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that a full and complete evidentiary hearing was conducted because all of the parties testified and were allowed to present witnesses and conduct thorough cross-examinations, and the parents were not prevented from presenting any evidence. The court also found that the trial judge weighed all of the evidence presented according to the required legal standards. The court determined that although a single isolated act by a minor in Illinois could be sufficient to establish that the minor was beyond the control of his parents provided the minor's conduct was seriously harmful and points to grave danger, the child's conduct in this case did not rise to that level because the child's action was an exaggerated manifestation of parent-child conflict, and was not sufficiently serious to warrant a finding that he was beyond his parents' control. Additionally, the child, having gone to live with his sister and cousin, was not placed in a situation of grave danger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which denied its motions for directed verdicts and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Defendant camper owner appealed from the jury's verdicts finding him guilty of negligence and contributory negligence in a personal injury action filed against him by plaintiffs, a married couple, after their car struck the camper at an intersection missing a stop sign.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The camper owner was not familiar with the road that he was driving on, but he felt that he was on a preferred highway. The appellate court found that under the circumstances, the camper owner should have been prepared to yield to traffic from the right. There was evidence that he saw the car right before it hit his van; there were no skid marks. He either did not look to the right as he approached the intersection or he was traveling too fast when he entered it. The court found that the camper owner was negligent and contributorily negligent. The camper owner contended that the county's failure to replace the stop sign was the proximate cause of the accident. On appeal, the court found that the negligence of the camper owner and the county was the proximate cause of the accident. The court rejected the county's argument that it lacked notice of the missing sign in time to replace it. The court found that the highway department staff cut grass near the intersection earlier on the day of the accident when the stop sign was missing. The court affirmed all aspects of the circuit court's judgment but remanded for a redetermination of the damages awarded to the car driver's wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded for a redetermination of damages for the plaintiff wife jointly against the county and the camper owner. The court affirmed the judgment against the county for the camper owner's wife and affirmed the judgment setting aside the verdict for damages against the camper owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizen sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sustaining a decision of respondent municipal electoral board rejecting a petition that proposed a referendum petition on the subject of whether the municipality should adopt an ordinance providing a procedure for recall of elected officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen proposed that the referendum question be placed on the general election ballot in the city, but the municipal electoral board objected, arguing that the referendum was not authorized by Ill. Const. art. VII, as required under &sect; 28-7 of the Election Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 28-7 (1979). Ill. Const. art. VII gave voters the power by referendum to adopt or alter forms of local government and establish public offices. Affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that the enactment of a recall procedure was not one of the proper uses of a referendum under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7(3), which applied to non home rule units. Further, the court concluded that the omission of this use of a referendum by the constitution's drafters had not been inadvertent. Thus, the court determined that the trial court had been correct in finding that recall had not been made a fundamental right of the body politic in Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7(3) and in resisting the citizen's efforts to have the referendum issue placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmacists argued that the department violated their rights to due process because hearings in the matter of their license suspensions were held in the presence of an appointed hearing officer and at least one member of the board, instead of a quorum of the board. The pharmacists argued that by failing to have a quorum present during each session, the board did not have power to act. The court held that in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, it was not necessary that those persons who were ultimately charged with making findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations or administrative decisions be personally present to hear evidence presented during an administrative proceeding. The department director appointed a hearing officer to expedite the hearing of evidence and required that at least one member of the board was present for each session. Each board member was furnished with a transcript of the proceedings, which they each considered before making their decisions. The court held that the actions taken by the department director did not prejudice the due process rights of the pharmacists and affirmed the ruling of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the revocation of the license of one of the pharmacists and reversed and remanded the matter pertaining to the revocation of the license of the other pharmacist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), where a jury found defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-2 (1977), and armed violence, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33A-2 (1977). Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the indictment, the application of the armed violence statute, proof of her guilt, the jury instructions, and the grand jury proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that her conviction for armed violence based on the predicate felony of voluntary manslaughter should be reversed because the indictment did not adequately charge the offense. The court agreed and noted that the indictment made no reference to either of the alternative statutory provisions regarding voluntary manslaughter and failed to set for the nature and elements of the offense. Defendant next argued that the indictment should have been dismissed due to prosecutorial misconduct during the grand jury proceedings. Because the record was incomplete on the issue, the court resolved doubts caused by the incompleteness against defendant and presumed that the trial court ruled correctly. The court also determined that the jury's determination that defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter was not so unreasonable as to raise reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt. Finally, the court rejected defendant's contention that she was denied a fair trial because the trial court did not give a &quot;forcible felony&quot; jury instruction on her theory of self-defense. The court held that the giving of the instruction would not likely have affected the trial's outcome.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for armed violence and affirmed her conviction for voluntary manslaughter. Because the trial court might have been influenced by the armed violence conviction in sentencing defendant for voluntary manslaughter, the court remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing on the voluntary manslaughter conviction alone.</SPAN></P>

He contended that the ordinance under which he was convicted was unconstitutional and that the village failed to prove a prima facie case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of two violations of &sect; 20-137 for parking a recreational vehicle in his street after certain hours, and he was fined. The trial court denied defendant's motion for a directed finding that the parking tickets failed to apprise defendant of what, if any, aspect of the ordinance was violated, that the ordinance was unconstitutional and vague, and that the village had failed to prove its cause of action. The court first found that the ordinance, which banned overnight parking, was a reasonable exercise of a municipality's police power and was constitutional. It served a public purpose, and neither the ordinance nor the parking tickets were vague. Further, the officer's issuance of parking tickets to a recreational vehicle, which came within the definition of &quot;motor home,&quot; constituted a prima facie proof of a violation, and defendant did not introduce any evidence to rebut either the commission of a violation or that he was not the owner of the vehicle.

The court affirmed. The court found that the police did not conceal their identities or the fact that they were investigating a robbery, and the subterfuge allegedly used did not violate fundamental fairness. The court determined that defendant's arrest, based on probable cause, was legal and the motion to quash the arrest and suppress evidence was properly denied. The court also found that defense counsel's failure to object to evidence of computer records did not prejudice defendant and could not have been grounds for reversal.

The trial court found that the offense was accompanied by exceptionally brutal and heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty and sentenced defendant under the extended term provision of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) (Supp. 1978).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his former brother-in-law got into a fight. During the fight, defendant drew a knife and stabbed the brother-in-law. While the brother-in-law attempted to escape and was crawling away, defendant continued to stab him. The brother-in-law was stabbed 26 times. A psychiatrist testified that defendant was paranoid and that, at the time of the attack, he was suffering from a mental disease. Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to an extended term of imprisonment and in refusing to give jury instructions and jury verdict forms on each count of aggravated battery. Defendant also argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) was unconstitutional. The court held that there was ample evidence to sustain the extended term sentence where the offense was accompanied by exceptionally brutal behavior indicative of wanton cruelty. The court also found that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury instructions and verdict forms because, where a general verdict was returned, defendant was considered guilty on each count. Finally, the court determined that the extended sentencing was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Removal did not deprive the candidates of their right to due process of law.

The landlords filed a counterclaim for unpaid rent and damages to the premises. The jury awarded both parties damages in a general verdict and found the tenant contributorily negligent in an answer to a special interrogatory. The circuit court vacated the general verdict and entered judgment in favor of the landlords on both the complaint and counterclaim. The tenant appealed, contending that the special interrogatory was improper because it was incapable of controlling the general verdict. On appeal, the court reversed, remanded, and held that because the tenant's contributory negligence was irrelevant to her action for damages for a public nuisance, the jury's special finding in response to that special interrogatory could not have been inconsistent with the general verdict rendered in favor of the tenant and was, therefore, not in proper form.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence revealed that defendant and an accomplice robbed a store as well as several customers present at the time. Police arrested defendant several days later after finding him in a house where a kidnapped girl was reported to have been held. Defendant allegedly permitted the police to search the home for the girl, and police discovered a gun that linked defendant to the robbery. Defendant was arrested without a warrant later that day, and based upon testimony from his accomplice and others, he was convicted of armed robbery. In affirming the conviction, the court held that the trial court's finding that defendant gave consent for the search of the home was reasonable; however, it also ruled that there were no exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless entry to arrest defendant; thus, the arrest was illegal. However, based upon the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, the court concluded that the trial court's failure to have suppressed evidence seized during the illegal arrest did not constitute reversible error. The court also found that the trial court properly allowed an amendment to the indictment to correct a miswriting.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 114, para. 70 (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad claimed that the statute was unconstitutional as an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. Affirming, the court said that the trial court did not err in ruling that a moving train violated the statute, which included moving as well as standing trains. The statute, construed to prohibit moving as well as standing trains from obstructing a railroad highway grade crossing for a period in excess of 10 minutes, was not an unconstitutional and unreasonable interference with interstate commerce. There was a reasonable basis for the enactment of the statute: to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Illinois from the danger of being cut off from emergency police, fire, and ambulance services. Trains blocking main thoroughfares for extended periods of time created safety problems and obstructed the flow of interstate highway traffic. Although the statute might have imposed some burdens on the railroad, the burdens had to be weighed against a significant countervailing safety interest. The statute's impact on interstate commerce was not such that it materially restricted the free flow of commerce across state lines.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then ransacked their home. The court held that the state met its burden of proving defendant legally responsible at the time of the incident. The evidence suggested a deliberate, rational approach to the offense. And, although here was evidence that defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect, the court found nothing to suggest that it deprived defendant of the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.

A plea of guilty had been negotiated in exchange for a one year probationary term, conditioned on defendant's voluntary commitment for psychiatric treatment and 90 days in the county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction, defendant left the hospital where he was undergoing psychiatric treatment without permission. At his revocation hearing, he rejected the services of the court-appointed attorney, despite being informed that he would be left without an attorney at the hearing due to the denial of his motion for a continuance to secure new counsel, and he failed to cross examine the State's witnesses or offer any evidence in his defense. On appeal, defendant contended that he had not effectively waived his right to counsel at the hearing and that his bail bond deposit was improperly taxed for the public defender's services. Because the State concurred in the latter contention, the court reversed that portion of the judgment below. Further, as to the waiver of counsel, the court ruled that the trial court failed to adhere to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-6-4(c) requiring it to determine in open court that defendant understood the purpose and nature of the procedure, his right to confront and cross examine witnesses, and the sentence that could be imposed. Thus, it could not be concluded that defendant's decision to waive counsel was knowingly and understandingly made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order revoking defendant's probation and remanded the cause for a new probation revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was chairman of the board and shareholder in a corporation that was in the business of selling franchise restaurants and bakeries. Prior to the Illinois Attorney General's approval of the corporation's application to register in accordance with the Franchise Disclosure Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121 1/2, para. 701 et seq. (1979), defendant negotiated the sale of a franchise. Defendant failed to escrow the monies in accordance with the Act, and the corporation went bankrupt. On appeal, the court held that the legislature unconstitutionally delegated authority to the Attorney General to exempt persons from criminal sanctions of the Act. The court found defendant knew that a franchise registration had not been approved at the time the franchise agreement was executed but did not know about the State's demand that he submit an escrow agreement for the franchisee's monies. Thus, the court held that such evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction for violating the fraudulent practice provision of the Franchise Disclosure Act.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in informing prospective jurors that the state would be seeking the death penalty and by asking them how this would affect their deliberations. Defendant also argued that he was denied a fair trial by the admission of expert testimony regarding blood type, by the admission of certain rebuttal testimony regarding defendant's prior use of knives, and that the consecutive life sentences were excessive and unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in admitting rebuttal testimony that contradicted defendant's statement on cross-examination as to his dislike for knives. The court held that the rebuttal testimony was patently relevant to the question of defendant's believability and veracity and that the jury was entitled to accept or reject the evidence. The court also held that while the trial court placed emphasis on the nature of the offense and the protection of society, it did consider the requisite factors in imposing the consecutive life sentences.</SPAN></P>

The local liquor control commissioner for the city revoked the owner's license and refused to provide the owner with a copy of the deputy commissioner's report which recommended the revocation of the license. The lower court affirmed the administrative decision, and the court affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that the refusal of the local liquor control commissioner to provide the owner with a copy of the deputy commissioner's recommendations did not violate the owner's due process rights because administrative officers were free to consult with non-investigating staff personnel.

Following a jury trial, the Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois) convicted defendant of armed violence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed violence. On appeal, the court held that defendant's oral motion for a new trial preserved all errors of record. However, the court did not address defendant's claim regarding the constitutionality of the armed violence statute because that issue was not raised at trial. The court found that the information specifically stated that the underlying felony upon which the armed violence charge was based was voluntary manslaughter, and that the jury was properly instructed. The court held that the jury's verdicts were not legally inconsistent. The court also held that statements defendant made to a police detective, while he was being returned to his cell, were properly admitted into evidence because he was afforded both an opportunity to confer with counsel and an opportunity to exercise his right to silence. In light of the clarity and detail of defendant's recollection of the events prior to the argument with the deceased, the court was not persuaded that his claimed alcoholic amnesia warranted a reversal Absent a showing that the decedent's statements were somehow connected to defendant or the crime, they were irrelevant and properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the permanent injunction that prohibited the adult book store from operating at its current location. The court held that the ordinance did not violate any rights under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to six years' imprisonment for armed violence and for aggravated battery and he appealed, contending that the trial court erred in failing to grant him a continuance to obtain a necessary witness, in failing to grant an evidentiary hearing on his motion for rehearing on his motion for new trial, in allowing testimony as to a telephone conversation, and that he was improperly sentenced. The court held that the failure of defendant to make an offer of proof prevented the state from stipulating to the testimony of the unavailable witness, and the testimony would have been cumulative because defendant had presented three other alibi witnesses. The court concluded that the enhancement of the offense of battery to aggravated battery was based on the use of a deadly weapon, and that the presence of the weapon also served as the basis for the armed violence charge.

The trial court found that the weapons evidence was the product of an illegal search, where the police opened defendant's truck door without permission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three offenses that arose from the discovery by police of weapons in his truck during the course of a routine traffic accident investigation: unlawful use of weapons in that he knowingly carried a loaded firearm in his vehicle, unlawful use of weapons in that he knowingly possessed a bludgeon, and possession of a firearm without the requisite firearm owners identification card. The trial court, after a hearing, granted defendant's motion to suppress, and the state appealed. The question was whether opening the door of a vehicle by police to examine the vehicle identification number on the door post in the course of a routine accident investigation without asking permission of the driver constituted an illegal search. The court affirmed the trial court because there was a reasonable privacy interest involved, a search occurred, and the search did not fall within the &quot;automobile exception&quot; because there was no evidence of the exigencies that supported such searches where criminal conduct was suspected.

On appeal, the court reversed, finding that reversible error occurred when the jury was instructed that the state did not have to produce expert testimony on the question of whether or not the movies at the adult bookstore were obscene. The court explained that the instruction was unnecessary surplusage, that it served no purpose but to lessen the credibility of the testimony given by defendant's witnesses, and that it greatly increased the likelihood that the jurors might have impermissibly applied a personal, rather than a statewide, community standard. The right of defendant to introduce her own evidence tending to establish that the materials were not obscene should not have been offset by the instruction as to the state's corresponding non-duty. The court further found that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence that defendant made the movies available for viewing by the general public. Accordingly, the state failed to provide the jury with sufficient evidence of defendant's scienter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission cited plaintiff licensee for committing 208 violations of Rule 24 by advertising that it accepted credit cards for liquor sales. The licensee filed for review in the circuit court, which found that Rule 24 was unconstitutionally void and enjoined the commission from enforcing it. On appeal, the court modified the order and affirmed. The court found that the commission only sought to enforce the third paragraph of Rule 24 and held hat the third paragraph was severable from the rest of the rule. The court determined that the commission failed to demonstrate that restricting the licensee's right to advertise protected the public health, safety, or welfare or that it promoted restraint in the purchase or consumption of alcoholic beverages. Further, the licensee's right to free speech prevailed over the commission's regulation, which did not bear a substantial relation to the interests that the Liquor Control Act sought to protect. Finally, the court held that the trial court properly granted injunctive relief because the licensee showed that it would have suffered irreparable harm if Rule 24 had been enforced and that it was without an adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state employee appealed from the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois), which dismissed his petition for a writ of certiorari. The employee filed his petition against respondents, the Director of the Illinois Department of Personnel and others, asking that the rules and regulations of the Department that the director relied on as the basis for his refusal to consider the employee's grievance on the merits be ruled illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a grievance after he was suspended from work for three days without pay. At each step of the grievance procedure his case was denied consideration because he insisted upon being represented by private counsel. The employee was informed that as he was represented by a collective bargaining agent, he was required by Ill. Dep't Personnel R. 3-45 and the collective bargaining agreement to be accompanied or represented by the exclusive bargaining representative. On appeal, the court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 63b108c(1) provided the Department with the authority to establish a plan for resolving employee grievances and that, under Ill. Dep't Personnel R. 3-45, an employee could only be represented by the exclusive bargaining representative unless there was no such representative. The court held that this rule did unlawfully delegate to the bargaining agent the Department's decision-making power. The court further rejected the employee's claims that to require him to accept representation by the collective bargaining agent violated his rights to due process and equal protection. The court thus concluded that Rule 3-45 was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court denying the employee's petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple drug offenses. The trial court merged the simple conspiracy and delivery offenses into the greater calculated criminal drug conspiracies and sentenced defendant to concurrent seven year terms for the two calculated criminal drug conspiracies. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that (1) the trial court did not err when it allowed the state to amend the indictments shortly before trial because the amendment neither surprised nor prejudiced defendant; (2) exigent circumstances existed to justify a warrantless search; (3) the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a directed finding was proper because defendant did not prove entrapment as a matter of law; and (4) defendant's failure to object to statements by the prosecution during trial and closing arguments constituted a waiver of those issues on appeal. Finally, the court reversed defendant's conviction for one count of calculated criminal drug conspiracy on the grounds that the evidence did not show that defendant exercised sufficient influence over his company-conspirators to systematize their activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PTAB determined fair market value and then applied a factor of 29.57 percent based upon the county's urban weighted median level of assessments for 1977.

On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's judgment and affirmed the decision of the PTAB. The court held: (1) since the PTAB was required to determine the correct assessment of property, the PTAB acted within its authority by taking into account the 1977 urban weighted median level of assessments; (2) the 29.57 percent figure was prima facie evidence that the level of assessments of like property within the county was lower than the 33 1/3 percent figure used by the board of review for the assessment of the taxpayer's property; (3) the PTAB had authority to grant relief from the disparity in levels of assessments within the county; and (4) the PTAB could utilize a level of assessment figure that was derived from a one-year sales ratio study when necessary to reach an equitable result.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois) entered a judgment in favor of the employee, and the insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued that the tort of outrage was barred by the Illinois Insurance Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 73, para. 767 (1979), or Workmen's Compensation Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138-1 et seq. (1979). The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the claims were allowed. The employee was not an insured, but was a third-party claimant on a policy issued by the insurer. The remedies of the Insurance Code were not available to third-party claimants. Therefore, the statute could not preclude the employee's suit. The employee was also entitled to recovery beyond the scope of the Workers' Compensation Act concerning an injury which would be compensable under the Act. The employee sued his employer's workmen's compensation insurer for injuries which occurred while he was engaged in the line of his duty. He sought compensation for injuries resulting from conduct which occurred after he had ceased to work for the employer and claimed that the insurer committed fraud. The complaint alleged that the insurer acted with the intent to injure him and that the insurer did more than simply delay payment, allegations beyond the requirements of the Workers' Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>

The License Appeal Commission affirmed a decision by the local liquor control commissioner to revoke the licensee's liquor license. On appeal, the licensee argued that the woman was not his employee. The court affirmed. The court held that the commissioner chose to believe the police officer's testimony and that testimony was sufficient to show that the prostitution statute was violated by one of the licensee's employees. The court further held that the licensee was not entitled to a de novo trial and that &sect;&sect; 5 and 8 of article VII of the Liquor Control Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 43, paras. 149, 153 (1977)), which created classifications for review based on population, were not violative of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

He was found guilty of theft, unlawful use of weapons, and armed violence. He appealed his convictions, and the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that &sect; 33A-2 was not unconstitutionally vague. Section 33A-2 did not require that a weapon facilitate the underlying offense, but the mere fact that defendant carried the weapon while he committed the felony was sufficient to come within the language of the statute. The court ruled that men of common intelligence did not have to guess at the meaning of &sect; 33A-2, and it did not differ as to its application. The court determined that the penalty to remedy the evil was not so disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense such that it shocked the moral sense, or that it was cruel or degrading.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter after he killed a man in a fight in a tavern. On appeal defendant claimed that: (1) the trial judge erred by refusing to admit into evidence testimony by a defense witness describing two prior acts of the deceased which allegedly showed his violent, aggressive character; 2) that the trial judge improperly relied upon a prior void conviction in sentencing defendant; and 3) that defendant was entitled to credit on his sentence because of time spent in the penitentiary on a conviction based on a statute subsequently declared unconstitutional and void. The court reversed the order of the trial court. The court held that the acts described by defendant's witness were insufficient to establish that the decedent was violent in nature and that the evidence had no probative value in determining whether defendant was the aggressor or acting in self-defense. The court ruled that the trial judge abused his discretion when he improperly relied upon defendant's 1965 conviction for possession of marijuana, a conviction based upon a statute later declared unconstitutional. The court dismissed defendant's &quot;credit&quot; argument as patently without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father filed an action for visitation with his child. The mother, who had never been married to the father, opposed the action. The trial court dismissed the petition on the ground that no cause of action was recognized for the initiation of an original proceeding by a parent seeking visitation rights with his child when he never had custody, had never been married to the natural mother, and the parties had never lived together as a family. The court reversed the order of the trial court. The court held that the language of &sect;&sect; 601, 603 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act was sufficiently broad to encompass a custody proceeding without a marriage relationship. The court held that the rights of a putative father who had acknowledged parentage of a child were recognized under the law and that by that acknowledgement, he assumed burdens along with benefits. The court ruled that the fiction of habeas corpus was no longer a proper vehicle to enforce paternal rights of visitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county filed an action in the circuit court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Cook County Outdoor Movie Theater Ordinance was constitutional and an injunction barring the outdoor theater from operating without a license. Subsequent to the filing of the complaint, the theater applied for and received a license to operate as an outdoor theater, thereby rendering moot the county's prayer for injunctive relief. The court found that the outdoor theater lacked standing to contest the validity of a provision of the ordinance that proscribed the admission of minors to certain movies because it claimed to cater exclusively to adult audiences. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional solely because the regulations were based on the content of communication protected from total suppression by the First Amendment. The court held that part of the ordinance was overbroad but that the portion of the ordinance requiring screening to eliminate viewing from private residences was enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that clauses (A) and (C) of the Cook County Outdoor Movie Theater Ordinance were constitutional.

In addition, first defendant was charged with delivery and possession of cocaine and second defendant was charged with possession of cocaine. In a separate action, a third defendant was charged with possession of cocaine. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the charges. Plaintiff, the People of the State of Illinois, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the charges on the ground that cocaine was not a controlled substance under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401, 1402 (1979). The trial court also found that the charging instruments failed to give defendants proper notice of the charged crimes because the instruments did not apprise defendants of the form of cocaine they were alleged to have possessed and/or sold. On appeal, the court reversed. The court first determined that the instruments on their face met the pleading requirements of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 111-3 (1979) in that they stated the name of offense, cited the relevant statutory provisions, set forth the elements of the offense, and stated the time and place of the crime and the name of the accused. The court also found that instruments properly apprised defendants of form of cocaine they were alleged to have possessed or sold. The court acknowledged that the Illinois Controlled Substances Act covered only &quot;1&quot; cocaine, but found that the use of the term &quot;cocaine&quot; in the instruments was sufficient to inform defendants that they had been charged with possession or sale of the controlled form of cocaine.</SPAN></P>

The State challenged the trial court's decision granting defendant's a post-conviction petition, which alleged that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several bottles of a red substance were found in defendant's possession. It was determined that the red substance was the same type of codeine that doctors prescribed to treat a cough. On appeal, defendant argued that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In order to sustain its burden of proof, the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly possessed a controlled substance in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(b). The court held that the critical question was whether the State proved that the substance in question was a controlled substance as defined by the Illinois Controlled Substances Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, paras. 1100-1603 (1975). The State classified the codeine as a schedule II, III, and V controlled substance. After defendant was charged, the legislature amended the Act to include codeine as a schedule II drug; however prior to that time, codeine was not a schedule II drug. Therefore, the court held that State failed to prove that codeine was a controlled substance under schedule II. Likewise, the court held that codeine was not controlled substance under schedules III and V.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended inter alia that the evidence was insufficient to establish guilt because it was based primarily upon the testimony of his biased wife from whom he was separated. The court affirmed the conviction but remanded for sentencing. The court held that the credibility of a witness was strictly within the competence of the fact finder and that there was sufficient evidence to support the version believed where the evidence corroborated the witness' testimony. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced where the lower court restricted cross-examination of his wife on certain issues because those issues were cumulative.

The state's attorney conceded that there were no exigent circumstances, which eliminated the need for a warrant. The state argued that an authorized person gave the police the consent to enter the premises. The court affirmed the order because the state failed to demonstrate voluntary consent for the warrantless search. There were no exigent circumstances, which would have excused the warrantless entry and arrest. The police officers had ample opportunity to obtain a warrant before the arrest. Furthermore, there was no evidence as to the good faith of the police officers. The record did not provide the court with sufficient facts to determine whether defendant's statement was free from the taint of the illegal arrest. Therefore, it was proper to suppress the statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the injured minor was hurt while riding as a passenger in a vehicle driven by his brother and owned by his father, he sought recovery against the father's insurance company based upon statutorily mandated uninsured motorist coverage. In reversing the trial judge, the court held that a policy provision purporting to deny coverage to family members was void as against public policy, as it would have placed an injured family member in a different position than a third party. Even though the uninsured motorist policy provision provided a two year limitation on claims, that provision did not bar a claim by the injured minor, who had until two years after his 18th birthday to file a claim. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 22 (1983). Collateral estoppel did not apply to the claim, as a determination that the driver of another vehicle was not at fault did not compel the finding that the driver of the vehicle in which the minor was riding was at fault, so the case was remanded for a trial. As there was a legitimate claim that the policy provision was applicable, the insurance company had not unreasonably denied the minor's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because the State's sole identification witness allegedly did not see the face of the perpetrator of the crime. The court held that a positive identification by a single witness who had an adequate opportunity to observe the offender was sufficient to support a conviction as long as the witness's testimony was credible. The court noted that the witness testified that he saw the armed robber face-to-face for a period of approximately 15 seconds in an alleyway illuminated by streetlights some 45 to 50 feet away. While the witness first identified defendant by the hat he was wearing, the witness was able to identify defendant by his facial features. Therefore, the court held that the witness's experience was adequate to permit a positive identification. Next, the court determined that the toy gun that defendant used to commit the robbery constituted a dangerous weapon because the shape, size, weight, and composition of the toy gun made it capable of inflicting serious bodily harm, particularly if used to batter the head and face of a victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor lost his arm in an accident involving a piece of farm machinery that his grandfather had purchased a little more than 10 years before the date of the injury. The products liability statute of limitation, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 83, para. 22.2(b) (1979), provided that no products liability action based upon a theory of strict liability in tort could be commenced after 10 years from the date of sale of an allegedly defective product to its initial user. The minor argued that the statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him. The court held that the statute was not a true statute of limitation because it extinguished a cause of action before it arose, but it held the statute was reasonably related to the constitutionally permissible purpose of limiting the growth of the number of claims filed for strict liability in tort, and therefore did not violate Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court held that the minor's claim was not protected by Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 because he did not have a vested right. The court held that the savings clause in the statute did not apply to the minor because his claim did not arise within the period permitted by the statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that defendant was not entitled to transfer matters because the State had shown that those matters had occurred in the county of the trial court.

The court found further that the indictment charged defendant with all material elements of attempted murder and that testimony as to his other crimes against the victim on the night in question was admissible to show motive. The court held that there was sufficient evidence of evidence guilt and that the trial court properly instructed the jury on attempted murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county sheriff's merit commission brought an interlocutory appeal challenging the decision of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which granted, on remand, an injunction, in favor of plaintiff deputies, restraining the enforcement of a commission rule restricting political activities of the deputies. The trial court had previously granted a preliminary injunction that had been reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the trial court found the rule was unconstitutionally overbroad and preliminarily enjoined its enforcement. The commission appealed, contending that the trial court failed to dismiss the action in accordance with the mandate issued in the prior opinion; that the action was barred by collateral estoppel; and that the rule was not facially overbroad. The deputies sought to dismiss the appeal on the grounds of mootness because the commission enacted a new rule prohibiting political activity. The court agreed that the issue of whether the old rule was constitutionally overbroad was moot. The court held that the only persons threatened by the previous rule were the deputies, who would have standing to challenge the rule if it was applied to them in a manner which violated their first amendment rights. The deputies, however, did not challenge the rule as applied. Further, the court held that the deputies did not have standing to challenge the prior rule as unconstitutional on its face on the basis of vagueness or overbreadth. The court reasoned that they were the only ones threatened under the rule and it was supplanted by a new rule which was not directly before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction following a jury trial. Defendant claimed that his conviction should have been reversed because the trial court improperly admitted into evidence the victim's in-court identification of defendant following an unduly suggestive photographic identification procedure implemented by the police. The court held that under the totality of the circumstances there was not a substantial likelihood of defendant's irreparable misidentification. The court found that the victim's identification of defendant had an origin independent of the lineup, and his in-court identification of defendant was properly received into evidence. The court found that the pretrial identification procedure used by the investigating authorities was far from perfect and agreed with the trial court's conclusion in granting a motion in limine concerning the photographic lineup. The court held that the prosecutor's improper remarks did not constitute a material factor in defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company, a Minnesota corporation licensed to sell insurance in Illinois, was sued by the state officials for deficient and delinquent taxes pursuant to the retaliatory tax provision at Ill.

The trial court granted the insurance company's motion for summary judgment and ordered the state officials to refund the money. The state officials appealed, and the court affirmed. The insurance company was not subject to the retaliatory tax because Illinois companies doing business in Minnesota were not subjected to a more onerous tax rate.

The trial court sua sponte dismissed the complaint against the pet owner and held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-60-2 authorized the village to pass and enforce all necessary police ordinances to define, prevent, and abate nuisances. Under the rational basis test, the ordinance, which limited pet ownership based on whether a residence was a single-family residence or a multiple-housing building, Carpentersville, Ill., Village Code &sect; 15-23 was valid. The differences in the classifications included considerations of space, density and proximity to others, noise levels, and structural differences. The limitation on the number of dogs was necessary for the protection of the health and safety of the community, and the classification scheme was reasonably related to that purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner purchased a used car from a dealership. Later, the city police department confiscated the car as contraband per se because the vehicle identification number (VIN) on the car was false and the confidential VIN was illegible. The state filed a complaint for an order permitting the city to sell the car. The owner filed an interpleader and a motion to strike. The trial court entered an order declaring that the car was the property of the police department pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4--211 (1979). On appeal, the court reversed and held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4--107(i) (1979) was unconstitutional as applied against the owner because it violated his due process rights. The court found that stripping an innocent purchaser of his rights to a car without giving him notice or a hearing would not assist in uncovering car thieves. The court noted that the owner was completely innocent of any wrongdoing and had no way of discovering that the car he had purchased was unconstitutional.

The trial court agreed with the citizens that the EPA's public hearing violated the Administrative Procedures Act (act), Ill. Comp. Stat. 127/1101-1021 (1979). On appeal, the EPA contended that the citizens failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and that the complaint should have been dismissed. The court agreed.

The court reversed defendant's conviction for armed robbery because the court found that it was a lesser included offense of the felony murder charge. The court reasoned that armed robbery was a lesser included offense because the felony in the felony murder was established by proof of the same or less than all of the facts required to establish the offense of murder in the course of an armed robbery. The court also found that the trial judge did not err in determining that defendant's conduct was exceptionally brutal or heinous and thus indicative of wanton cruelty. The court reasoned that in evaluating the brutality and heinousness of an offense, the entire spectrum of facts surrounding the given incident must be analyzed and evaluated. Defendant's act of stabbing the victim seven times after shooting him twice adequately spoke for itself, irrespective of whether the victim was actually dead at the time of the stabbings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the armed violence statute was unconstitutional, that the jury's verdicts were legally inconsistent, and that the prosecutor's closing argument denied him a fair trial. The court affirmed the judgment. The court concluded that defendant was not aggrieved by the application of the armed violence statute. The court found that based on the record, the jury could have rationally concluded that defendant had different states of mind when he fired the several shots he fired at the victim. The court observed that there was evidence that the first shots were fired during a struggle with the victim and that the last shot was fired while the victim was prone on the ground. The court noted that the jury could have found that defendant acted recklessly in firing the initial shots and knowingly with respect to the final shot. The court concluded that the complained of arguments did not rise to the level of plain error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had originally been sentenced to two consecutive terms of probation after entering guilty pleas to two of three attempt arson charges. The factual basis then presented indicated defendant had set fires at a hospital and a building after feeling rejected by males who had been counseling her. A psychiatric evaluation concluded that defendant had a long-standing and deep-seated neurotic preoccupation with sex which was manifested by hysterical attention seeking, including the setting of fires. Defendant continued to seek counsel and began seeing a priest. The psychiatrist recommended that she be only counseled by females. After she was sentenced to probation, she began counseling with a female therapist. However she attempted to see the priest and began making phone calls to him. The petition alleged that defendant had violated the terms of her probation by committing three criminal offenses. The trial court found a probation violation in her perpetration of the offense of harassment by telephone. The court reversed and held that not only did the charging instrument fail to set forth a criminal violation, it described behavior which was found unconstitutional to proscribe.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 38, para. 8-4 (1977), in the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois). The trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 15, 7, and 5 years for the respective offenses. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was in the custody of a county youth home, assaulted an employee of the facility and took him hostage in an attempt to secure his release. He was convicted of multiple offense in connection with the incident. Defendant claimed on appeal, inter alia, that the indictment did not properly charge the offense of forcible detention. The court held that the indictment was fatally defective with respect to the forcible detention charge because it failed to allege that defendant's purpose in taking the employee hostage was to obtain performance by a third person of defendant's demands, which was an essential element of the offense under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 10-4(a). The court determined that the missing language could not be supplied by presumption or necessary implication. The court also found that the forcible detention and attempt escape convictions were lesser included offenses of the armed violence offense and, therefore, that the convictions could not stand. Further, the court determined that defendant waived his remaining claims of error by failing to include them in his post-trial motions and that none of the alleged errors amounted to plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shell Oil Company hired a South Carolina company that employed nonunion labor from the south rather than union labor from the Springfield area to build a local mine. A community coalition gathered to convince local governmental officials and Shell that workers from outside the Springfield area labor market should not be used to construct the mine. The coalition started a secondary boycott by picketing Shell service stations and blocking entryways, causing irreparable injury and harm to the service station owners. The court affirmed the injunctions against the coalition, finding that secondary boycotts, even though free from violence, may be enjoined where the activity was directed at a neutral employer. The court found that the service station owners possessed a property right in their businesses that needed protection. As a result of the coalition's picketing, irreparable and substantial damage was being inflicted upon the owners by the loss of customers and of good will, which placed the businesses in a financially hazardous position. Because of the uncertainty as to damages and loss of good will, the extraordinary relief in the form of a preliminary injunction was warranted.</SPAN></P>

By special interrogatory, the motorcyclist was found to be contributorily negligent. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 65 (1979) was declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court ruled that: (1) the trial judge erred in holding that the answer to the special interrogatory was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the jury could have found that the motorcyclist failed to take any reasonable alternative available to avoid the accident; (2) section 65, which provided that when a special finding of fact was inconsistent with the general verdict the former controlled the latter, did not unduly infringe upon the inherent powers of the judiciary, and &sect; 65 was, therefore, constitutional; and (3) because the answer to the special interrogatory was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and because &sect; 65 was constitutional, the court ordered that a judgment be entered in accord with the special interrogatory, which barred a recovery by the motorcyclist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Upon defendant's request, an implied consent hearing was held pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11 -- 501.1. The Circuit Court of Jo Daviess County (Illinois) entered its judgment that defendant's driver's license would not be suspended, which plaintiff State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred when it decided that defendant's driver's license not be suspended because all four findings made by it during the implied consent hearing were in favor of the State. The State asserted that the trial court was compelled to notify the secretary of state to suspend defendant's driving privileges and that such suspension was mandatory after compliance with the statutory requirements of &sect; 11 -- 501.1. The court held that the dispositive portion of the trial court's notice to the secretary of state was the findings on the issues and not the trial court's &quot;decision&quot; that defendant's license be suspended or not, nor its &quot;recommendation&quot; of a restricted driving permit. The court held that neither the trial court's decision nor its recommendation affected the exclusive statutory authority of the secretary of state in regard to licenses. Anything beyond the trial court's findings on the four issues in the implied consent statute was superfluous and could not be said to have prejudiced the State. Although the court found that the trial court's decision not to suspend was inconsistent with its findings, the inconsistency did not require reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Third-party plaintiff helmet manufacturer appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissing its third-party complaint for contribution against another defendant, driver of an automobile which struck a motorcycle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a motorcycle accident, the administrator of the estate of the motorcycle rider brought an action against multiple defendants, including the driver of the vehicle that struck the motorcycle (driver), and the manufacturer. The manufacturer sought contribution from the driver, who had reached a settlement with the administrator. In affirming the dismissal of the manufacturer's complaint for contribution, the court held that the manufacturer failed to allege any pre-tort relationship between it and the driver which gave rise to a duty to indemnify. The allegation that the driver solely and proximately caused decedent's injuries did not support a claim for indemnity, for in the absence of some pre-tort relationship, proof of the allegation would exonerate the manufacturer completely from liability to the deceased's estate, and there would be no need for indemnity. Conclusory allegations that the driver somehow misused the deceased's helmet or that he assumed the risk of the helmet worn by the deceased did not state a cause of action, as the court could not see how one not a user of a product could be deemed to misuse or assume the risks of the product.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the trial court applied an aggravating factor not present in the record, improperly considered the fact that he was a public aid recipient, and improperly allowed the payment of court costs and public defender fees to be assessed from defendant's bond deposit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At 4 a.m., a police officer saw defendant's upper body sticking through a bathroom window of a commercial building. Defendant went back inside, and the officer found defendant in the bathroom. Defendant was convicted and sentenced for burglary. On appeal, the court reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing. The trial court erred in applying the &quot;risk of harm&quot; aggravating factor because the risk of harm was not greater than that inherent in most burglaries. The trial court did not consider public aid as an aggravating factor, but instead referred to defendant's record and propensity to commit crime instead of working in order to obtain a livelihood and indicated that defendant had not made a reasonable effort to be gainfully employed. It was permissible for the trial court to take these factors into consideration. The court erred in imposing a fee for the public defender's services to be withheld from defendant's bond money, but the assessment of costs was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in order to have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, defendant had to show either that he was directly affected by the statutory provision or that the unconstitutional feature was so pervasive as to render the entire act invalid. Because defendant made no attempt to introduce evidence of the prosecutrix's reputation for chastity, he could not contend that he was affected by the statutory provision. Further, the rape shield law did not violate his right to due process or deprive him of his right to confrontation. Defendant also argued that it was error to admit testimony at the sentencing hearing of a witness who testified that defendant had attacked her at a particular time and place because the charge had not resulted in a conviction.

The owner sought injunctive relief and compensatory damages for the city's failure to provide garbage removal service to condominium owners when the city provided service to owners of single family homes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner asserted that the city's failure to provide the services violated the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The trial court agreed with the city that the multiple-dwelling ownership from in the Park Ridge, Ill., Council Policy Statement No. 5, which clarified Park Ridge, Ill., Ordinance 14-4-6, was not a suspect classification, and that the city had a rational basis for distinguishing between the refuse needs of the two groups. The dwellers in multifamily units had greater bargaining power than persons who owned a single family home. On appeal, the city asserted that the owner's claims were moot because the city had amended the challenged code sections. The court held that the owner's complaint for injunctive relief was moot, but that her claims for damages were not. The rational basis for the classification of owners of multifamily units was sufficient for grounds for dismissal of the owner's complaint under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 48(1)(i). Park Ridge, Ill., Council Policy Statement No. 5 was entitled to a presumption of validity because it did not modify existing ordinances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the orders of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which convicted her of armed robbery after a bench trial. The trial court refused to hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion to quash arrest and to suppress evidence because defendant had previously litigated the same motion in a separate robbery trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in two armed robberies in different counties and gave a statement that included both offenses. Defense counsel filed a motion to quash arrest and to suppress evidence in the first county, but did not have the arresting officers present and did not avail himself of a continuance offered by the trial court. Defendant later pleaded guilty. On this appeal of the second conviction, the court noted that the doctrine of collateral estoppel was of limited utility in criminal cases because defendants did not have an immediate right to appeal pretrial rulings and could be cut off from appellate review by an acquittal or a guilty plea. The court held that the lack of review brought the case under an exception to the doctrine that barred relitigation of the same motion. The court also found that testimony of the arresting officers was &quot;available&quot; at the first hearing, but that defendant's counsel was ineffective. The court held that the lack of a full and fair hearing on the motion and the lack of effective assistance of counsel violated defendant's fundamental rights and were &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; that allowed her to relitigate the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of conviction and sentence and remanded with directions that the trial court conduct an evidentiary hearing of defendant's motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence. The court instructed that if that motion was denied, the trial court would reinstate the judgment and sentence, but if it was granted, the trial court would give defendant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's challenged to the constitutionality of &sect; 115-4.1(a), which permitted her trial in absentia because of her wilful avoidance of trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed applications to rezone parcels of real estate.

The land use committee recommended denial of the city's applications. However, the city council approved the applications. The owners of seven of the parcels sought declaratory relief, contending that the city had no authority to accept an application to rezone property without their written consent and that therefore they had been denied due process by the subsequent rezoning. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the consent requirement constituted an unlawful delegation of the city's rezoning power. The court also held that judicial relief from an unlawful zoning ordinance was appropriate only after the property owners had exhausted the available local remedies, which they had failed to do.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners challenged the validity of an amended zoning ordinance and special use granted by the county and sought an injunction against a proposed planned unit development. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment for the county and held that that there were no deficiencies in the process of the zoning amendment. In their effort to overturn the amendment, the homeowners did not satisfy their burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the ordinance bore no substantial relation to the public welfare. The court held that the requirements of Cook County, Ill., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 13.15 were not met because the homeowners failed to show that they owned the requisite percentage of frontage, and, therefore, a three-quarters vote of the county commissioners was not necessary. Because the zoning board did not make a recommendation either way, only a simple majority of the county commissioners was needed to pass the amendment. The notice of the hearing was timely. The court affirmed the decision after considering five factors in determining the validity of an amended ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised several issues on appeal including that the trial court erred in refusing to give an accomplice instruction tendered by defense counsel, that he should be granted a new trial because his attorney formerly had represented a state's witness, that the prosecutor made improper remarks and that his sentence was unconstitutional. The court ruled that defendant properly was convicted of the crimes. The court found that the accomplice instruction was correctly refused by the trial court because the evidence established that the person at issue was an accessory after the fact who did not aid the defendant in the murder or robbery of the victim. The court also found that no new trial was required because the public defender had terminated his representation of the state's witness prior to trial and there was no conflict of interest. The court also ruled that the prosecutor's remarks were proper and that the sentence imposed was constitutional and did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After she was abducted at knifepoint, the victim escaped and later identified defendant as her attacker from a photographic array. The victim also identified defendant at a lineup on the basis of his appearance and high-pitched voice. When his guilty plea was vacated, defendant petitioned for discharge based on an alleged violation of his statutory right to a speedy trial within 120 days. The petition was denied. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, holding that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not denied because his plea of guilty operated to toll the running of the 120-day rule during the period that elapsed between the entry of such plea and the order vacating it. Next, the court held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel where defense counsel's law partner was a former assistant State's Attorney who participated in the preliminary stages of the prosecution. Defendant had knowingly and intelligently waived any conflict of interest. Furthermore, given the victim's unequivocal in-court identification and corroborating testimony, the admission of prior consistent statements to bolster the victim's identification was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Appellee property owner had challenged &sect; 28-41 when it was required to post a deposit in exchange for a building permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner successfully challenged the village's reversal of the village zoning board's approval of its petition to rezone its property to allow for development of mixed residential and commercial uses. The property owner then successfully challenged the validity of &sect; 28-41, which required it to post a deposit for the costs of certain improvements before the issuance of a building permit to allow it to make connections to the sanitary sewer system. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Section 28-41 was invalid because in its enactment, the village had exceeded its grant of power by the Legislature. Section 28-41 was not in compliance with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11-12-8 (1979), which required the approval of the plat of the property involved before requiring the posting of a performance bond or deposit to ensure the completion of improvements to the property. The disputed ordinance was silent as to approval of a plat upon payment of a bond or deposit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Indicted by state and federal authorities on drug charges, the owner pleaded guilty to the federal charge. He claimed on appeal of the instant forfeiture action that it imposed another penalty, in addition to the federal one, so that it was barred by &sect; 409 of the Controlled Substances Act. Section 409 prohibited a prosecution on a controlled substance charge in Illinois after a conviction or acquittal in a federal or other state court on a charge that was based on the same acts. The court, however, ruled that the forfeiture action was not barred by &sect; 409. The prosecution contemplated by &sect; 409 was strictly a criminal one, while the forfeiture action was a civil, in rem proceeding. The forfeiture proceeding did not determine the owner's guilt or innocence but only whether the vehicle had been used in the commission of the offense. Thus, although the same criminal acts to which the owner had pleaded guilty formed a connecting link between the vehicle and the forfeiture proceeding, the prohibition of &sect; 409 did not affect the forfeiture proceeding under the Forfeiture Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation brought an declaratory judgment action against the county, challenging the constitutionality of a county zoning ordinance.

The court found that the Department had no recognizable right that would have justified its intervention under the applicable provisions of the Civil Practice Act, Ill. Rev.

The court rejected the Department's argument that the state's interest in protecting the public interest in general and wildlife in particular gave it standing to intervene, noting that the interests the state sought to protect were speculative, and that there was no showing that its interests would not have been adequately protected by the county attorney.</SPAN></P>

After he was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life in prison, defendant appealed. The court affirmed, finding that his guilty pleas were knowingly entered because the trial judge adequately admonished him of the maximum possible sentence of imprisonment for his natural life. Therefore, there was no abuse of discretion when the motion to withdraw the plea was denied. The court also ruled that the circuit court properly found that the murders were accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty, as contemplated in applicable provisions of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 9 -- 1(b), 1005 -- 8 -- 1(a)(1) (1979), and warranted the life sentence. He gloated after the shootings and was unrepentant.

In affirming the judgment the court held that &sect; 115-4.1 was neither facially unconstitutional, nor unconstitutional as applied to him. The court held that the statute and decisional law provided that his voluntary absence constituted a waiver of his right to be present during the trial. Further, the statute was not unconstitutional as applied because the circuit court's admonition was sufficient; the record did not have to reflect a positive statement that he understood the admonition. Additionally the State proved that his absence was a result of his efforts to avoid trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of attempted murder, four counts of armed robbery, rape, deviate sexual assault, and aggravated kidnapping and was sentenced to consecutive and extended-term sentences totaling 110 years. The evidence indicated that on the night in question, defendant committed armed robbery and attempted murder on the first victim, who was walking down a street. Defendant then entered a laundromat and took the wallets of two men inside, before abducting and raping a female victim who was also inside the laundromat. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the extended-term provisions of the Uniform Code of Corrections and the length of his sentences. The court affirmed, holding that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in imposing extended-term sentences or making the sentences run consecutively because the circuit court properly considered the multiple offenses committed by defendant, as well as defendant's prior history of delinquency and criminal activity. The court stated that because three sets of offenses took place, which were not part of a single course of conduct, there was no error in imposing three sets of extended-term sentences.</SPAN></P>

The dealer sought and received an injunction from the trial court, with the trial court finding that the manufacturer could not terminate the contract absent a showing of good cause. The manufacturer appealed. On review, the court found that the good cause requirement only existed in Ill. Rev.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, pars. 1-1, 11-3, 12-11 (1979). Defendant's main contention on appeal was that his early admissions to the police officers should have been suppressed on the ground that he was illegally detained by the police in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was told to go to the police station to be interviewed regarding a rape but the police had no probable cause to arrest or detain him. His only connection with the crime was that he fit a general description given by the victim. The officers testified that they had no intention to arrest defendant, yet they detained him for over 12 hours and subjected him to 5 separate interrogations until sufficient incriminating statements were obtained to serve as a predicate for his arrest. During his police detention, defendant was never told that he was not under arrest or that he was free to go. On appeal, the court explained that while the latter facts were not controlling, they were significant factors in the totality of the circumstances that caused the court to conclude that defendant was illegally seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. That fact that defendant received Miranda warnings was insufficient to attenuate the taint of his unlawful seizure and validate his subsequent admissions. Thus, the court held that the trial court erred in not suppressing defendant's admissions and that the error was sufficiently grave as to require a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The administrator alleged that the deceased had leased a taxicab from the taxi company and was killed during the operation of that cab when one or two passengers shot him. The administrator claimed that the taxi company was negligent to provide a taxicab that did not have a bulletproof shield between the passengers and the driver. The administrator also claimed that the taxi company was under a common law duty to protect the deceased from the criminal acts of third parties while using the taxicab. The court found that the statute relied on by the administrator, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 12 -- 605 (1979), had been declared unconstitutionally vague as a penal statute and could not be relied on to establish a statutorily defined duty and standard of conduct in a negligence case.

Section 508(a) of the Act authorized a trial court to adjudicate, incident to a pending dissolution proceeding, the liability of either spouse for the costs and attorney fees necessarily incurred by the other spouse as well as for his or her own costs and attorney fees. The court held that &sect; 508(a) was not prohibited special legislation and that the trial court properly entered judgment for the firm against its own client. The court held that &sect; 508(a) affected all members of the same class alike. Further, a unique function of the trial court in dissolution proceedings was to make divisions and allocations of property, enter orders of support, and determine whether one spouse should pay the other spouse's attorney fees. It was reasonable for the legislature to have provided that the same court determine fee disputes between attorney and client.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telephone company sought a declaration that it did not owe back taxes, penalties, and interest assessed by the Department. Both parties sought review when the trial court held that the Act exempted revenues from the transmission of interstate messages, but had expanded, sub silentio, to impose the tax on revenues from interstate messages. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the Act did not impose a tax on receipts from the transmission of interstate messages, and that it made no distinction between those taxpayers which operated entirely in Illinois and those which also had facilities or activities located outside Illinois. The court ruled that the Department's assessment of a tax on that portion of the telephone company's revenue derived from the relaying of interstate messages was an improper retroactive application of new regulations dealing with the Act.

Also, the 160-day term for bringing defendant to trial was renewed by his agreed continuance, in a case arising prior to March 1, 1977. In addition, a timely commencement of trial on one of the murder charges after entry of judgment in the robbery case did not excuse the State from bringing defendant to trial on the other murder charge within the same 160-day period. Further, the court held that a tolling of the statutory period for interlocutory appeal applied only when the appeal was taken in the cause which was otherwise subject to dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured driver suffered personal injuries when his car was struck from behind by the truck driver's truck. The injured driver, who claimed that he was struck after he stopped in the center land of a highway to assist the stalled driver, whose car had broken down in that lane, filed an action for damages against the truck driver, his employer, and the stalled driver. The truck driver, stalled driver, and another witness testified that the injured driver was struck after he swerved in front of the truck driver, who was in the process of stopping in order not to strike the stalled driver's car. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of all defendants. The trial judge had the inherent judicial power to give the jury a special interrogatory on contributory negligence, which the jury answered in the affirmative, and its use of the interrogatory was not unconstitutional. The general verdict and the answer to the special interrogatory were not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court did not err in refusing to give an instruction regarding negligence of the stalled driver because the instruction misstated the law or was not warranted by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 16 years old at the time of the offenses. Promising his 10-year-old victim a horse, defendant lured her to the site of a previously prepared grave where he raped her. He then strangled her from behind with his bandana. He put her body in the grave and covered it with dirt. Defendant later confessed to the crime and claimed that he was insane. A pathologist testified that rape could not be ruled out on the basis of his findings. The court upheld the convictions and sentences. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was not proven guilty of rape beyond a reasonable doubt because the only evidence tending to show that a rape occurred was defendant's confession. The court held that direct and positive evidence was unnecessary to prove the corpus delicti and it was sufficient if other evidence so corroborated the confession or admission as to show the commission of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, photographic evidence tended to corroborate the confession. Further, the trial court did not err in imposing a life sentence on the ground that the murder was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that: (1) the trial court's order directing disclosure of the state psychiatrist's report was beyond the scope of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 413(d) (1979); (2) his statements were involuntary; (3) insufficient time elapsed from his demand for an attorney to permit a waiver; and (4) the trial court erred in denying his application for the divestiture of a news reporter's privilege. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The report, while adverse to defendant, did not deny him any privilege against self-incrimination. Defendant volunteered himself into the station house and deceitfully bent every effort to mislead the police. There was no indication in the record that the police were doing anything other than attempting to protect defendant until the officer shortly after noontime had the opportunity to review the statement of the neighbor. It was then that defendant's duplicity began to emerge and adequate probable cause to detain him arose. As for the reporter's privilege, other sources not only were available to defendant, but it was difficult to perceive what public interest might have been involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant village appealed from the Circuit Court of Tazewell County (Illinois), which held that an ordinance adopted by its board of trustees was void as beyond its regulatory power. Plaintiff sheltered care home sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was void because it was beyond the police power of the village or because certain provisions offended against the due process provisions of the Illinois and United States constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village relied on Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11--11--1 (1979) as the source of its power to enact the ordinance which sought to regulate and prohibit false fire alarms. The sheltered care home had installed a fire detection system that was connected to the fire station in the village. Prior to the date of the enactment of the ordinance, the system began to trigger numerous false alarms to which the fire department responded. The court noted that no express power to require fire detection devices was found. The court held that &sect; 11--1--1 conferred no substantive powers, but was an implementing grant which permitted the enactment of ordinances to carry out powers elsewhere conferred. The court held that if the village had required the installation of fire detection devices, the regulatory ordinance would have flowed naturally from &sect; 11--11--1. The court held that there was no ordinance requiring installation, only an ordinance purporting to regulate something not required. The court found that the power to regulate existed only when the object of regulation was mandated by a specific ordinance and that the circuit court was correct in finding that the ordinance was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the circuit court. The court held that the power to regulate existed only when the object of regulation was mandated by a specific ordinance and that the ordinance was beyond the power of the village and hence void. The court held that the judgment of the circuit court in favor of the village on the constitutional issues was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The payors alleged that they and members of the class that sought to be certified had been improperly required to pay jury fees, pursuant to an administrative circuit rule. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 25, para. 27.1(v) (1979) provided that a circuit court could set only fees not covered by the section. The court held that the payors' request for a declaratory judgment that the circuit rule was invalid and for an injunction against assessment of jury fees under the rule had been rendered moot by the enactment of the statutory provision for jury fees set forth in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 25, para. 27.1(d)(5) (1979). The court held that the payors did not provide the trial court with any basis for concluding that the class was so numerous that joinder was impracticable because the payors merely alleged this in a conclusory fashion and did not support this conclusion. Thus, the trial court properly held that the action could not be maintained as a class action. The payors' failure to allege the county or counties where they allegedly were required to pay jury fees resulted in a failure to state a cause of action against the circuit clerks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence and remanded to the court. Although unable to agree on a majority opinion, five members of the Supreme Court held that a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction could not be used collaterally to impose an increased term of imprisonment, or an enhanced penalty, upon conviction for a subsequent offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court had called into question the constitutionality of an enhancement provision of the theft statute, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 16-1(e)(1) (1975), which provided that a second or subsequent conviction for theft of property not exceeding $ 150 in value was punishable as a Class 4 felony. The court found that the provision was unconstitutional as applied to defendant but was not unconstitutional on its face. Although the court found that the prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction with no imprisonment was not violative of the Constitution, it was the subsequent use of the evidence of the conviction to enhance a misdemeanor to a felony that was unconstitutional. However, it was not sufficient to reduce the felony conviction to a misdemeanor in order to cure the constitutional infirmity because there remained no valid evidentiary purpose to balance against the obvious prejudice to defendant when the jury heard it. The admission of the prior conviction for the sole purpose to invoke an enhanced penalty was constitutionally impermissible and was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the 120th day after defendants' arrest, the state filed nine additional charges against defendants which arose from the same incident as the initial charges.

The court held that: (1) defendants were tried on the new charges after the permissible 120 day term had expired and the state was responsible for the delay because their late filing caused defendants to request a continuance; and (2) defendants waived the issue whether they were denied effective assistance of counsel on grounds that their defenses were antagonistic because defendants did not raise the issue during trial or in their post-trial motions, and furthermore there was no actual conflict where neither defendant attempted to implicate the other.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been in police custody for 9 1/2 hours at the time he made a statement regarding his involvement with the murder. Defendant alleged that he had been mistreated while in custody, but police testimony controverted his claim. Defendant suggested that such testimony was not credible due to conflicts within police testimony as to other issues. At trial, an officer testified that defendant had made an oral statement, but that he had refused to reduce it to writing. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held, in part, that: 1) defendant's statement was not the result of physical or psychological coercion and was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and therefore his motion to suppress was not erroneously denied; 2) defendant's right against self-incrimination was not violated when the officer referenced his refusal to sign a statement and any error was cured when the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the officer's statement; and 3) defendant waived his right to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 5-5-3.2(b)(2) when he failed to raise the issue at trial.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 1-1 et seq. (1979), defendant Illinois Department of Public Aid (IDPA) appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, inter alia, enjoined the IDPA from further denial of payment for dental and optical care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For budgetary reasons, the IDPA discontinued payment for dental and optical services to GA recipients. The trial court held that the IDPA had violated its duties under the code, but on appeal, the court reversed. The court reviewed the history of the code, and held that the code set forth a flexible public assistance scheme and granted the IDPA broad discretion to allocate scarce resources. The court noted, for example, that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 108 (1965) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 6-2 (1979) utilized the word &quot;may&quot; in delineating the parameters of the GA program. The recipient argued that the use of the mandatory &quot;shall&quot; in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 6-1 (1965) required that all medical needs of recipients be provided through the program, but the court held that, construing the section consistently with the rest of the statute, para. 6-1 mandated only that those persons meeting the tests for GA eligibility set forth elsewhere receive such aid as the statute otherwise provided. Finally, the court held that the IDPA's construction of the statute did not violate equal protection by providing some types of medical services and not others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, which enjoined the IDPA from denying payment for dental and optical care, dissolved the injunction, and entered summary judgment for the IDPA.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court held a hearing that provided due process of law. No abuse of discretion was shown. The court also affirmed the conviction for murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which entered a judgment of conviction for operating a movie theater without a license, a violation of the Springfield City Code, &sect; 42A.2, and fined $ 25. The trial judge did not expressly declare unconstitutional any portion of the theater license ordinance but ruled that severability saved the licensing requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant did not apply for a theater license, he had standing to challenge his conviction because the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face. On appeal, defendant argued that the city's theater license ordinance, Springfield City Code ch. 42A, was unconstitutional. The city conceded the unconstitutionality of certain sections in the ordinance but believed that they were severable and that the licensing section was valid by itself. The theater license ordinance did not contain its own severability clause, but the City Code had a general one applicable by its own terms to all sections of the code. The court reversed the conviction. All the restrictions on the issuance of licenses in the city's theater license ordinance were clearly and admittedly invalid, and without those the ordinance was only an empty shell. References to safety codes were insufficient to sustain the licensing requirement of an ordinance overloaded with invalid criteria. The invalid portions of the theater license ordinance were not severable, and the whole ordinance was invalid as an ensemble.</SPAN></P>

The Commission speculated that the applicant entered into an oral agreement with the stockholder to purchase the carrier when he was hired and failed to get prior approval from the Commission.

The media organization filed an action for a writ of mandamus ordering the housing authority to produce the requested information and filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied the media organization's motion and held that the housing authority prevailed on its affirmative defenses. The court reversed and held that the records requested were &quot;reports and records&quot; as meant by Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 116, para. 43.103(a) (1979), which guaranteed the public access to information on the operations of state and local government. The court further held that landlords and tenants who received public funds had no protectable right of privacy because public aid was not a private fact. The court noted state provisions that already mandated disclosure of the names of recipients of public aid. The court remanded the cause to the trial court with instructions to enter an order issuing a writ of mandamus granting the media organization access to the records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of McDonough County (Illinois) denying his petition for post-conviction relief. The court had previously affirmed on direct appeal his conviction for rape. Following the court's affirmance of his conviction, he filed the underlying petition in the circuit court seeking post-conviction relief, which was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first noted that most of defendant's claims, including the effectiveness of trial counsel, were waived for failure to timely raise them. Therefore, the court would not address them. One issue that was not waived, however, was whether defendant's due process rights were violated when, at the pretrial hearing to determine his competency to stand trial, he was unconstitutionally given the burden of proving himself unfit to stand trial. The court found that the fitness hearing conducted in the instant case pursuant to the &sect; 5-2-1(i) of the Unif. Code Corr., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-1(i) (1975), constituted a violation of defendant's due process rights and necessitated reversal. The only question that remained was whether the court was to remand for a retrospective fitness hearing or for a new trial. The court reluctantly held that, in view of the difficulties inherent in conducting a nunc pro tunc redetermination of defendant's fitness at trial, the only way to adequately protect his due process rights was to afford him a new trial, provided that he was fit for retrial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. It was within the trial court's discretion to admit into evidence the reason defendant was stopped. Although it was unnecessary to comment upon the screwdriver protruding from the auto's ignition, admission of this unnecessary detail was harmless error. Admission into evidence of the handcuffs found on defendant was not error because it was intertwined with the circumstances of the arrest. The prosecutor's argument regarding defendant's credibility was within permissible bounds. Further, defendant's closing argument, that the police officers were biased and had lied, invited the state's response thereto in rebuttal. The state's closing argument that possession of handcuffs strengthened the supposition that defendant was in possession of a weapon was improper, but it did not result in substantial prejudice to defendant. There was no indication that the difference in the sentence after trial from the sentence upon the withdrawn guilty was a penalty for the election to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from his rape and deviate sexual assault conviction, defendant argued that the prosecutor's closing argument regarding defendant's failure to call corroborating witnesses denied him a fair trial because he had no duty to produce a witness who was equally accessible to the State. The court affirmed, and held that defendant had failed to raise the objection at trial or in his motion for a new trial and, therefore, it was waived. Further, any error caused by the closing remarks was harmless. The court held that defendant had been notified before sentencing of the aggravating allegation and that it was not necessary to include it in the information. An extended-term sentence was properly imposed upon a finding of only one of the aggravating factors, heinous conduct, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b) (1977). The extended-term statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's behavior went beyond what was necessary to show exceptionally brutal and heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty. Finally, the trial court correctly did not consider evidence of a separate incident regarding pending charges against defendant in imposing the sentence.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants had argued in their motion to dismiss that existing case law had struck down &sect; 402 as unconstitutional. The State contended that the constitutional infirmity was not present in the instant action because possession of talwin did not incur a more severe penalty than delivery of the same substance. Based on an order in an unrelated chancery action that declared talwin to be temporarily regulated by Schedule IV of the Act rather than Schedule II, defendants argued that possession at the time of the arrest would incur a more severe penalty and, thus, equal protection was violated. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the existing case law was limited to applications of the Act that subjected a defendant to a harsher penalty for possession than for delivery or manufacture of the controlled substance in question. As a Schedule II controlled substance, the court found that charges of possession of talwin were, therefore, not constitutionally infirm. The court also pointed out that the chancery court order that declared talwin to be a Schedule IV controlled substance did not have the potency of stare decisis as it had not been appealed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed in part and affirmed in part, holding that: (1) there were not two acts committed which were sufficient to support convictions for both rape and unlawful restraint; (2) the victim's testimony as to her doctor's medical advice was cumulative and not prejudicial to defendant; (3) the jury instruction on the issue of resistance was proper as there was evidence that the victim was threatened and intimidated by defendant, and the Prim instruction was proper as the case was not a complex one, the law was not misstated, and the jury was not confused; and (4) the trial court properly considered both a letter from the victim regarding the effect of the rape upon her and defendant's prior criminal record in determining defendant's sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the cases appeared moot the court found that the public interest required a determination of the consolidated appeals.

It was further variously asserted that by the time a hearing could be held the loss or detriment suffered would be irretrievable. The court held the preliminary injunctions to stay the suspensions were properly issued pending hearings on the merits by the board, despite the fact that the preliminary injunction was the only relief being sought from the circuit court. The court concluded that none of the licensees were deprived of due process of law by the interim suspensions made by the stewards. The public interest in preserving the integrity and honesty of the horse racing industry outweighed any inconvenience to the holders of race-track-related occupational licenses caused by the summary interim suspension of licenses pending a hearing before the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of robbery and aggravated assault. One was sentenced to an extended term of 12 years for robbery and a five year term for aggravated battery, the sentences to run concurrently and the other to concurrent terms of imprisonment of three years for robbery and two years for aggravated battery. Both defendants were ordered to reimburse the public defender. Both defendants asserted that the obligation to reimburse their public defender was unconstitutional and one defendant challenged the imposition of an extended sentence based on prior convictions within a 10-year period. The court vacated the reimbursement order because the obligation had been previously determined to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed the imposition of an extended sentence because the complaining defendant had been previously convicted in Illinois within the preceding 10-year period, excluding time spent in federal custody within Illinois. The court determined that the fact that the custody was in federal, rather than the state system had no impact on the tolling language in Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff payors challenged a summary judgment from the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois), which awarded the payors only the sums representing payment of court costs to defendant county. The payors had filed suit seeking reimbursement for fines and costs they paid to the clerk of the circuit court after the payors were convicted under a controlled substances act later held to be unconstitutional. Both sides moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Of the fine and costs money received from the payors, a portion was remitted to the county treasurer and another portion was remitted to the county's State's attorney. These sums represented payment of court costs. Fine money was disbursed to the State and a city equally. None of the balance had gone into the county treasury. On appeal, the payors argued that the trial court was a county officer and because the money had gone into the hands of the clerk, the county was liable for reimbursement. The trial court concluded that the clerk of the circuit court was not a county officer and that the county was liable only for sums actually received by it. The court held that: (1) the payors' action more nearly resembled the common law action for money had and received than a tort action; (2) under the Illinois Constitution, the clerk was also a judicial officer; (3) since the money was paid out not in the ordinary course of duty but under a mistake as to what that duty was, equity required restitution; and (4) this was particularly true because the county would be able to recoup disbursements from the State and the city or at least make setoff on future payments due to those entities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the summary judgment fixing damages and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions that the amounts of the judgments entered be increased as to each payor to reflect the fines paid by them to the clerk.</SPAN></P>

By its own terms, defendant's proposed instruction inferred by its language that defendant would have been committed as a result of a commitment hearing. Inasmuch as this misstated the law, and as it would have mislead the jury, the instruction was properly refused. The defendant also argued that his sentence was excessive. The court disagreed with this argument because the record fully supported the sentence within the court's proper exercise of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and armed robbery. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in not suppressing incriminating statements that he alleged were elicited in violation of his right to counsel as provided in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Ill.

On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that the record showed that a jailer wrongfully interfered with the attorney-client relationship where there was no valid reason to justify the jailer's denial of a personal consultation between the attorney and defendant while defendant was being held. However, there were significant intervening circumstances between the time that the attorney was denied permission to consult with defendant and defendant's making of the statement, including the passage of almost 24 hours, and the fact that defendant was given his Miranda warnings, which he claimed he understood before he voluntarily made the statement, to support the court's finding that the causal connection between the police misconduct and the incriminating statement was sufficiently attenuated to permit the use of the incriminating statement at trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 48, para. 60 et seq. (1977), for injuries suffered while working on the home of defendant, who was experienced in construction work and was operating as the general contractor (homeowner). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered judgment on the jury verdict against the homeowner. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner decided to put an addition on his house. He was a principal or shareholder and vice-president of a company that was to install gutters and shingle the roof. He had the authority to stop the roofer's work if it was being done in an unsafe manner, and he scheduled the work. The accident occurred when the roofer placed a ladder in a muddy, uneven area close to a recent excavation for the project, and began carrying a 85-pound bale of shingles up. The ladder slipped. Affirming the decision, the court noted that the homeowner performed the duties of general contractor and coordinator personally and not as an employee of his company, and as general contractor, he was responsible for job safety. The court found ample evidence supporting the jury's finding that defendant reasonably could have known about violations of the Act. The court added that the covenant providing that the roofer would not seek to execute any judgment against any personal assets of the homeowner, but reserved the right to execute against assets relating to his insurance, was irrelevant to the finding of damages. The court also rejected the homeowner's argument that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a police officer who had issued two traffic tickets to defendant was coming before the trial court to testify, defendant slapped the officer in the face. The trial court determined that defendant was in direct contempt and sentenced him to five months' imprisonment. On appeal, the court concluded that a contemptuous intent was inferable from the action of the contemnor. Defendant was guilty of direct contempt because his action did create a disturbance and interfered with the orderly administration of justice. The court determined that, because of the unique circumstances present in direct criminal contempt cases, an order finding a person in contempt was able to be entered without prior notice, written charge, plea, issue, or trial. Defendant's due process rights were not violated. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to five months' imprisonment and, absent proof of abuse of discretion, the court had no power to modify defendant's sentence under Ill.

The court stated that although accomplice testimony should be scrutinized carefully, the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice could be sufficient evidence to support a conviction. Here, the court stated, it was satisfied that defendant was proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Next, the court noted that the Illinois Supreme Court had held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-4.1 (1979), which authorized reviewing courts to reduce a sentence to probation, was an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority over the judicial standard of sentence review. Thus, the court had no authority to reduce a sentence of imprisonment to one of probation. Finally, the court held that because the trial court had not specified its reasons for arriving at its sentencing determination, as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-4-1(c), it could not review defendant's complaint that his sentence was excessive. Therefore, the court vacated defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court with respect to the first four points, but it reversed and ruled for defendant on the fifth point. The court found that there was intent to commit fraud when defendant failed to pay a bill to pick up his car from a repair shop. Defendant admitted he issued a bad check with the intent of obtaining the car after there was a dispute over the repairs and corresponding charges. Defendant was in a position where he had to pay the charges or leave his car. The court concluded that defendant issued a bad check intending to overcome a valid lien in favor of the repair shop, but such a self-help measure was not a lawful defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees filed a complaint against the commission, alleging that because there were sufficient funds to cover their employment, the discharges were in bad faith and that they had a constitutionally-protected right in their employment sufficient to require a plenary hearing. The trial court ordered reinstatement and awarded backpay. The court reversed, holding that the trial court's finding of bad faith by the commission was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The fact that a supervisor purportedly laid off painters and bricklayers as retribution against the foremen of those shops was not believable in light of the numbers of employees who were discharged. The court found that the lay-offs did result in substantial savings and that there was insufficient evidence of bad faith to rebut the presumption of the commission's good faith. The court found that the employees were not discharged within the meaning of &sect; 16 of the County Hospitals Governing Commission Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 34, para. 5026 (1977) and that any property interest in their jobs was adequately protected by the hearing provided them.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that there were no mitigating factors and that the murder was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that defendant waived the right to argue that the waiver of his Miranda rights was involuntary because he failed to raise this issue at trial or in a post-trial motion. The failure of the police to inform defendant of the nature and purpose of their questions did not render the statements involuntary. The court found that the natural life statutory provision, para. 1005-8-1(a), was not unconstitutionally vague. The court could only impose the natural life sentence if the murder was accompanied by behavior which was brutal or heinous, and which indicated wanton cruelty on the part of the perpetrator. The court found that this provision gave reasonable guidance and was designed to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. When the natural life provision was read in conjunction with other statutory provisions and the sentencing scheme established by the legislature, it did not violate Ill. Const. art.

A verdict was directed in favor of defendant on a charge of armed violence based on intimidation. The jury acquitted defendant of the charge of attempted murder. On appeal of the armed violence based on property damage conviction, defendant contended that the armed violence statute was unconstitutional because the mandatory minimum penalty of six years for his conduct did not reasonably relate to the seriousness of the offense of criminal damage to property. The court held that because of the seriousness of defendant's conduct and defendant's long criminal record the trial judge properly exercised his discretion to impose a greater sentence than the minimum demanded by the statute. The court found that the armed violence statute was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to defendant because the legislature's rational and legitimate intent to severely punish an armed individual who showed disrespect for the law was met under the facts.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that equitable relief was appropriate even though the administrative proceedings were continuing because the barber had shown the inadequacy of available remedies, the futility of pursuing exhaustion of administrative remedies, and the likelihood of irreparable injury if the courts did not intervene. The court found that it was unnecessary to determine whether &sect; 52 of the Ill. Barbers Law, Ill. Rev.

The negotiated rate was less than that paid under the prevailing rate of wage. The employees brought suit seeking relief from the redesignation of their wage rate classification. The trial court granted the university's motion to dismiss and the court affirmed. It found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 127, para. 391 (1975) (Pay Act), did not apply to the employees as the university was not an agency of the state within the Pay Act. Further, redesignation of the employee's wage status did not violate the University Civil Service System Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24 1/2, para. 38b1 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Springfield Metropolitan Exposition and Auditorium Authority (authority) appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), that was entered in favor of defendant director of the Illinois Department of Business and Economic Development (department). The authority filed this action for a declaratory judgment to have a paragraph in its contract with the department declared void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority was created by the Springfield Metropolitan Exposition and Auditorium Authority Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 1251 et seq. (1979), to promote and operate expositions in the city, with the power to purchase or construct convention centers. The authority was funded in part through the Metropolitan Civic Center Support Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 1391 et seq.(1979), which was administered by the department. In order to fund the purchase and construction of a convention center, the authority entered into an agreement with the department for state support of its bonds. The department required the contract to contain a provision that it would receive the bond proceeds each year as a set off against the state support payments on the bonds. The authority filed for a declaratory judgment and the trial court found in favor of the department. On appeal, the court reversed. The court determined that under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 1394(3) the department did not have the authority to require the provision in the contract. The provision meant that the state was paying less than the statutory requirement and was therefore void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which entered judgment in favor of the department, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The board ruled that the police officer's conduct was cause for discharge. The lower court affirmed the ruling. The court partly reversed the factual findings as unsupported by the evidence, and remanded the matter for the imposition of a lesser sanction holding that the police officer's conduct of not fully paying off the parking tickets was insufficient cause for discharge.

The court concluded that the trial court's November 30, 1978, granting of the public defender's motion to withdraw on the sole ground that defendant had substantial bail on deposit in various Illinois counties was erroneous. The court further concluded that defendant's testimony and admissions showed that he made gratuitous conveyances to his ex-wife, during the pendency of the case, of property and money, which defendant could have used to hire appointed counsel. The court determined that the trial court should have concluded on the basis of defendant's transactions during the pendency of the case that defendant had or controlled assets sufficient to enable him to employ counsel.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court noted that the statute defining home invasion had been held constitutional. There was sufficient evidence to show that defendant's entry was unauthorized, even though he disputed that fact. Further, the unauthorized entry was the mental state proscribed at time of entry, therefore, no evidence of any other intent was required. He failed to preserve his evidentiary challenges when he failed to include the contentions in his post-trial motion and based his appeal on a ground different than that asserted at trial. The court refused to review for plain error because he received a fair and impartial trial. He did not establish his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to the standard applicable to representation by private counsel. The sentence was not disproportionate. The conviction for battery was reversed because it was a lesser included offense of the crime of home invasion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed an action against the employer, claiming the employee's termination was in retaliation for opposing the employer's policies of sex discrimination against women. After several amendments, the employee moved to file a third amended complaint, alleging unconstitutional sex discrimination and violations of the Employment Practices Act and the Civil Rights Act. When the employee's motion was denied, review was sought. Upon review, the court held that the motion's denial was proper because the amended complaint did nothing but re-allege previously rejected matters. Alternatively, the court held that the amended complaint failed to state a cause of action. For instance, the court held that with respect to the constitutional prohibition against sex discrimination, the employee lacked standing to challenge the employer's policies toward women. The court also rejected the Employment Practices Act claim because the employee had failed to pursue and exhaust the administrative remedies. Likewise, the court rejected the Civil Rights Act claim because the employee's charge of discrimination had not been timely filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</SPAN></P>

The police officers later recovered a revolver, currency, and other evidence, and the store clerk identified defendant as the robber. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence that implicated defendant in the crime. The court held that the police had the right to make the investigatory stop because they had sufficient articulable facts to infer that criminal activity was afoot. The court held that the trial court properly found that defendant voluntarily consented to accompany the police officers to the store.

The court ruled that &sect; 33-3(c) was not unconstitutionally vague because &quot;in his official capacity&quot; meant accomplished by exploitation of his public position and that defendant's lawful authority as a public official was sufficiently defined that he was able to determine the propriety of his actions. The court found that &quot;personal advantage,&quot; in light of the purpose of &sect; 33-3(c), meant an advantage to a particular person as opposed to the public the officer served.

The court determined that the lower court had sufficient information as to defendant's financial status from a hearing held earlier to determine whether he was indigent with respect to the appointment of appellate counsel. The court stated that the information from this hearing, coupled with the earning capacity of defendant in the presentence report, was sufficient for the lower court to make its decision on the issue of restitution.

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 et seq. (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department collected and remitted taxes for both the city and the county. An audit revealed that two commercial enterprises were located in the county and not the city. The taxes from those two enterprises that had been remitted to the city totaled $ 479,718.41, and the department proposed to adjust the amount over a period of 36 months by deducting current payments to the city and paying them to the county. On appeal four principal issues were raised: (1) the power of the department to adjust future tax payments in order to correct past errors, (2) the time within which such adjustments of past errors could have been made, (3) the necessity of the adoption of rules by the department before any adjustments were made, and (4) the lack of administrative review or certiorari in the proceedings. Upon review, the court found that the city's issues were meritless. The department had the statutory power to make a correction in the distribution, no public policy was offended thereby, and any reliance on the receipt of the funds by the city was unwarranted. No period of time for correction existed and the department was free to go back as far as its records supported its actions.</SPAN></P>

A hearing was held on the first application and before a decision was rendered, the owner applied a second time. The second application was denied without a hearing and the first application was denied because of financial considerations, the physical problems with the track, and because there was another track within 45 miles (which was a violation of the Illinois Horse Racing Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 8, par. 37-1, &sect; 19(a)(1) (1979)). The Board also denied the third application filed a couple of months later without holding a hearing. The lower court and the court affirmed the Board's denial of all three applications. The court found that the Board's decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the deficiencies in the track were not trivial and at the time of the first application, the track was not suitable for racing. Although some improvements had been made to the rack before the second application was filed, there were still financial problems. The third application was made by the corporation, but was properly denied as it was controlled completely by the owner and his family.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs filed an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief alleging that defendants' fair housing ordinances were void as against real estate brokers and salespersons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the ordinances were void in their entirety because the state preempted all power to enact fair housing laws as to brokers and salespeople. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 24 of the Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen License Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 5742 (1979), declared that the powers and functions of that Act were exclusive powers of the state. However, the second paragraph of &sect; 24 provided that nothing in the Act should impair the validity of a Illinois Municipal Code insofar as any municipality enacting ordinances prescribing fair housing practices, defining unfair housing practices, prohibiting discrimination in real estate practices, and establishing fair housing or human relation commissions. The court held that defendants' fair housing ordinances that did not concern licensing, record-keeping, or permits were not subject to attack on the grounds of state preemption or a prior supreme court decision that held that the licensing of real estate brokers and salesmen was the exclusive power of the state. The court reversed the order of the circuit court granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of robbery and home invasion and sentenced to seven years imprisonment on the robbery conviction and eight years on the home invasion conviction. On appeal, he claimed that the home invasion statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12 -11 (1979), was unconstitutional because it did not include an element of felonious intent at the time of entry. The court held that because the issue was raised for the first time on appeal, it was not preserved for appellate review. The court further held that in light of the fact that there was no constitutional provision requiring the legislature to include criminal intent at the time of entry in the offense of home invasion, the issue was not reviewable for plain error. The court also held that the trial court properly considered the extent of the victim's injuries in imposing sentence on defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the answer to a special interrogatory was inconsistent with the general verdict, set the answer aside, and entered judgment on the verdict.

Defendant sought a rehearing, contending that the constitutionality of para. 65 had not been raised by the appeal, and requesting remand so that the trial court might exercise its discretion to decide what effect should be given to the general verdict. By separate order the petition was denied and one of the justices issued a supplemental opinion adhering to the reasoning set out in the original decision. In deciding to enter judgment on the general verdict, the court was required to give effect to a statute that encroached on its power or to exercise its inherent duty to protect the judicial power from encroachment.

After the trial court granted the owners' motion to dismiss, plaintiff sought review. After finding that the words &quot;suffer or permit&quot; required proof of knowledge of the prohibited act or conduct, the court held that plaintiff had failed to state a valid cause of action based on the ordinance because plaintiff's complaint did not contain an allegation that the owners knew or should have known of the sidewalk's defect. Likewise, the court held that plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action based on the theory of common law negligence because plaintiff had failed to plead that the owners had actual notice of the defective walk or constructive notice of such facts and circumstances as would lead a reasonably prudent person to such knowledge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant neighbor appealed an order from the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois), which entered a preliminary injunction preventing him from harassing plaintiff bus company president in any manner as described in the complaint and from interfering in any way with plaintiff's use and enjoyment of his property rights and his business operations. Defendant was specifically enjoined from making spurious complaints to governmental agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bus company president alleged that defendant neighbor engaged in various actions that interfered with his business. Defendant sent allegedly unwarranted letters of complaint to state agencies, accusing plaintiff of violations of various regulations. On numerous occasions, the parties contacted the police. Finding that most of defendant's complaints were without merit and that his actions constituted a nuisance, the circuit court entered a preliminary injunction. Defendant sought review. The order was reversed and the injunction was dissolved. The court held that the case was complicated because the alleged disparagement was communicated to government rather than the public, and defendant was not a commercial competitor. The portion of the order that enjoined defendant from annoying or harassing plaintiff as described in the complaint was improperly broad and imprecise under case law and the Injunction Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 69, para. 3 (1977). The remaining portions of the injunction, which stated that defendant could not interfere in any way with plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of their property rights and business operations, also lacked specificity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's order and dissolved a preliminary injunction. The injunction, which prevented defendant neighbor from making spurious complaints to governmental agencies concerning plaintiff's bus company, lacked specificity. While the court agreed that defendant's actions were harassment, it could not let stand an order enjoining future acts based upon what was by definition merely a preliminary determination of fact.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that the armed robbery statute's six-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. It held that considering the seriousness of the crime of armed robbery and the dangers inherent in the commission of that offense, the moral sense of the community was not offended by a six-year minimum term for armed robbery, even though defendant had no prior felony convictions and had some psychological and drug abuse problems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds that his written confession should have been suppressed because his right to remain silent had not been scrupulously honored and that he was denied a fair trial as the result of prosecutorial misconduct. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress. The court found that defendant's right to remain silent had been scrupulously honored because there had been a complete cessation of questioning for about one and one-half hours and because defendant was asked whether he recalled the Miranda warnings recited earlier prior to reinterrogation. The court found that the officer's asking whether defendant he recalled the previous warnings was a sufficient opportunity for defendant to exercise his right if he so chose. Concerning defendant's contention that he was denied a fair trial, the court found that the prosecution did not misstate the testimony of defendant's expert witness and that the prosecution's comments during closing argument were reasonable inferences drawn from the testimony. The court also found that other allegedly prejudicial comments had been cured.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and charged with armed robbery, burglary, and armed violence. Defendant filed a motion to quash his arrest and suppress physical evidence, oral statements, and his lineup identification. The trial court granted the motion, and the State appealed, asserting that the trial court erred. Defendant sought to dismiss the appeal for a lack of jurisdiction, claiming the trial court's order was not final and appealable, but the court disagreed. Nevertheless, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the record failed to demonstrate the existence of exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless entry into defendant's residence. The court noted that the officers had time to obtain a warrant but failed to do so. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant raised other issues. The court determined that where a claim of error had not been preserved by means other than the post-trial motion, the court could only review it under the plain error doctrine. The court explained that the information was sufficient because it apprised defendant of the offense with which he was charged with sufficient specificity to enable him to prepare his defense and to allow pleading a resultant conviction as a bar to a subsequent prosecution arising from the same conduct. The court concluded that the sentence had to be vacated on the ground that the trial court did not find that the offense was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty as was provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) (Supp. 1978) and/or that defendant had been convicted of a prior felony as was provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(1).</SPAN></P>

The manufacturer sought the right to bid for and be awarded the job of making the Illinois license plates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer's prior owner was convicted of bribing a state official, and all charges against the manufacturer, as a company, were dropped. The manufacturer changed its name and merged with a subsidiary. After the prior owner died, the manufacturer was invited to bid for a contract to produce license plates. The manufacturer submitted the lowest bid, but defendants rejected the bid on the sole ground that &sect; 10.1 of the Illinois Purchasing Act forbade the awarding of contracts to the manufacturer because of its prior owner's conviction of bribery. The manufacturer filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, and the trial court entered a judgment for the manufacturer. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that &sect; 10.1 permanently barred the state from awarding the manufacturer contracts because the statute spoke in clear and unambiguous terms that no &quot;person or business entity shall be awarded a contract.&quot; The court noted that there were no limitations to &sect; 10.1. The court held that once the prior owner's act was chargeable to the manufacturer, the prior owner's death became meaningless for the purposes of the application of &sect; 10.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the company argued that the city's ordinance regulating the size of signs was an unreasonable restriction on the company's use of its property.

The court found that the ordinance was reasonably related to the trinity of public health, safety, and welfare. The company argued that the ordinance was related to achieving aesthetic purposes only and was therefore invalid. The court rejected this argument holding that aesthetics was an element of the public health, safety, and welfare. The court reasoned that the welfare of a community included its appearance and, therefore, municipalities could enact zoning laws regulating the dimensions of commercial signs.

Defendant was convicted of attempted murder under para. 8--4, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for change of venue and reassignment because the establishment of special courts for recidivist cases was constitutional. The court found that defendant failed to show actual prejudice by being tried in a recidivist courtroom. The court concluded that the fact that the jurors saw defendant in handcuffs, though not preferable, was not inherently prejudicial and did not require a mistrial. The court held that it was not reversible error for the trial court to allow two police officers who witnessed the shooting to testify that they identified defendant in a lineup. The court found that disclosure of the actual sentences to be imposed under a statute that was effective at the time of the crime and one that was effective at the time of trial was not required for an intelligent election between the two sentencing codes.</SPAN></P>

The General Assembly amended &sect; 10 and &sect; 410 expressly to authorize the requirement that a defendant pay fines and costs as a condition of probation. The circuit court found that the amendments were retrospective. The court considered various factors in affirming that the amendments should have a retrospective application. Additionally, the court held that the probationers' complaint sought equitable relief. The complaint gave no indication that such a remedy at law was sought or that it would be inadequate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery and appealed his conviction. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that his guilty plea must be vacated because the prosecutor reneged on his promise to recommend a term of probation. The court found that defendant did not raise this issue at trial and further found that it could not decide the issue under the plain error doctrine because there was no error. The prosecutor kept his promise to recommend the sentence that was agreed upon by the parties, but the lower court chose to impose a higher sentence based on a prior conviction. This did not render defendant's guilty plea involuntary because the trial court was not bound to accept the recommendation of the prosecutor. As for defendant's argument regarding the application of his bail bond deposit to reimburse the county for expenses incurred by the public defender, the court found that the governing statute was recently declared unconstitutional.

Defendant alleged that the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act violated the United States Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art.

The court held that The Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act was a proper exercise of the legislative power of the Illinois Legislature and was constitutional. Although the Act generally prohibited a snowmobile's use on the busiest roadways, the Act allowed certain exceptions where a snowmobile was likely to encounter fewer traffic hazards. There was a reasonable relationship between the Act's limitation on snowmobile access to state highways and the safety of persons and property connected with the use of snowmobiles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city brought an action in equity against defendants, theater and operator (theater), to enjoin the theater from performing a show in which actual or simulated acts of sexual intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and masturbation were performed on stage before and adult audience. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found the shows to be a public nuisance and enjoined the performances. The theater appealed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The theater claimed that the injunction violated the First Amendment. The court reversed the order. To determine whether a state's obscenity laws were constitutional, a trier of fact had to determine whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, found the work, taken as a whole, appealed to prurient interests; whether the work depicted or described in a patently offensive way sexual conduct specifically defined in the state's law; and whether the work, taken as a whole, had any literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Obscenity was not enjoinable as a public nuisance under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 100 1/2, para. 1 (1977). Obscenity was not enjoinable as conduct which offended public morals and decency under common law public nuisance. Thus, the injunction against the theater offended the First Amendment. The injunction prohibited the performance of certain physical acts inside the theater. Because the trial court did not see future shows containing those acts, it did not know the content of those shows. It was possible that such future shows would neither appeal to prurient interests nor lack serious literary, political, artistic, or scientific value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that enjoined the theater from performing specific live actual or simulated sexual acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clerk contended that deposit of fee statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para. 722(2) conflicted with the Illinois constitution and was therefore unconstitutional. The trial court found that the statute was not unconstitutional and granted the county summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that the deposit of fees statute was constitutional. The court reasoned that the constitution empowered the Illinois General Assembly to provide by law for the appointment and election of clerks and other non-judicial officers of the court. The court found that this constitutional provision permitted requiring nonjudicial officers to pay all of their fee income into the county treasury, and court affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgment to the county on the issue of the deposit of funds. The court reversed the trial court's judgment concerning internal operations, including hiring, firing, classification and remuneration. The court found that the actions by the board regarding the remuneration and reclassification of employees were not within the board's budgetary and statutory authority pursuant to Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified before a grand jury that she had been instructed by a co-defendant to hold a lighter in a dark room so that her co-defendants could see what they were doing while they raped one victim multiple times before murdering her. Defendant then witnessed the murder of a second victim. At a preliminary hearing and at trial, defendant recanted her grand jury testimony. Defendant was convicted of murder, rape, and perjury and was sentenced to extended terms. Defendant appealed, but the court affirmed. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's specific intent to promote or facilitate the crimes. The court further held that the evidence revealed no attempt by defendant to leave; thus, she did not present a viable defense of compulsion. Because she did not raise the issue of her attorney's alleged conflict of interest and defendant had no proof that an actual conflict existed, the court rejected defendant's claim that her right to counsel was violated. Finally, the court ruled that the offense, not defendant's participation in it, was the determining factor which made her extended term sentence proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and four other armed men entered the victim's scrap metal warehouse and took money from his wallet. While the robbers searched the warehouse, the victim made his way out of the front door and to an intersection in the street, where he was subsequently shot. Defendant was found guilty of attempted murder, armed robbery, robbery, and aggravated battery and sentenced to two concurrent sentences of 10 to 12 years. On appeal, the court held that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutional validity of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4(a) (1975), the aggravated battery statute, as there was no contention that the alleged infirmity rendered the entire act invalid. The court found that although the jury was instructed and returned a verdict on the charge of aggravated battery, neither judgment nor sentence was entered on the jury's verdict, and therefore defendant was not convicted under the challenged provision, nor had he suffered any prejudice. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to tender an instruction on inconsistent witness statements, and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He observed defendant move off of a bed and towards the bathroom. The officer pushed the door open and pursued defendant into the bathroom, where the officer retrieved a plastic bag containing five foil packets. Defendant was arrested and later convicted of possession of a controlled substance. The court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that while the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for the theft of the lamp, the warrantless entry violated U.S. Const. amend.

The court noted that the officers had ample time to secure an arrest warrant and that there was no evidence that the delay occasioned by the securing of a warrant would have impeded the apprehension of the suspects.

The court held that the nudist failed to allege facts to show an actual, concrete controversy. The court found that the two instances, for which the nudist was actually arrested and prosecuted, concerned activities in or about his home and not for nude sunbathing at a public beach. Moreover, those activities occurred several years prior to the filing of the action. The court found that the nudist pointed to one isolated incident where he was threatened with arrest for disorderly conduct, but there was no allegation that if he repeated the behavior he would actually face the threat of prosecution and arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant served 55 of the 90 days imprisonment before the court granted defendant an appeal bond. The court found that defendant was properly advised of the potential sentence at the arraignment hearing. Further, once defendant waived his right to counsel, there was no reason to assume it had been revoked. Moreover, because a public defender who had represented defendant at an earlier stage had fully informed defendant of potential penalties, any error was harmless. Additionally in view of the substantial resistance which police officers encountered, and the fact that the sentence is far below the 364-day maximum sentence, the court was unable to say that defendant's sentence was an abuse of discretion. Finally, however, the order remitting the $ 250 to the county to defray the expenses of the public defendant was reversed because Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-7(g) violated equal protection and due process guarantees of both the State and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to a three-year term of imprisonment for burglary and concurrent terms of 364 days for the other offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother were tried and convicted of various offenses. When they were first charged by information, a public defender was appointed to represent them, but subsequently they retained private counsel, with one attorney to represent both defendant and his brother. The public defender withdrew and was granted an order directing the circuit clerk to make payable to the public defender's reimbursement fund a check to be noted against the bonds of defendant and his brother. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that: (1) although the statute allowing reimbursement to the public defender, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 110-7(g) (1978), was unconstitutional, reimbursement based upon quasi-contract or a contract implied in law was required in the instant case; (2) defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel because one attorney's representation of both him and his brother was a conflict of interest; and (3) there was no merit to defendant's contention that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Kankakee County (Illinois), which granted defendant's motion to withdraw her guilty plea and to dismiss the information. Defendant had entered a negotiated plea of guilty to unlawful possession of a controlled substance in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1210(b)(7) (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In exchange for her plea of guilty the State dismissed two other counts of possession of controlled substances and also recommended probation. Subsequent to her plea and sentence the State courts determined that the statutory section under which defendant had been convicted, Section 402(b) of the Controlled Substances Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1402 (1977), was unconstitutional and a nullity. The State challenged the unconstitutionality of the statute and also claimed that defendant was estopped from attacking the constitutionality of that section where her plea of guilty was entered pursuant to plea negotiations and where she received the benefit of her bargain. On review the court found that the State Supreme Court had already settled the first issue. The second issue was neither argued nor raised in the trial court and was waived. The court noted that waiver was particularly appropriate because the question of the validity and viability of the charge against defendant was a question that the defense quite understandably would have been able to contest below. The court noted that the State would have been free to reinstate the dismissed counts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that defendant's conviction had not been reversed, which would have required defendant to be resentenced under the current sentencing guidelines. The court rejected defendant's claim that he should not have been consecutively sentenced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county modified the method in which taxpayers could have paid their bills.

The trial court issued a preliminary injunction and the defendants counterclaimed, alleging that neither the town nor its collector had statutory authority to invest the proceeds of the real estate taxes collected. The trial court permanently enjoined defendants from collecting real property taxes under the new method and directed the distribution of interest earned by the town collector on invested tax proceeds to the county and credited to the county treasury. The parties cross-appealed. The court held that the town and the collector were entitled to retain the interest earned on the investment of tax proceeds and had the authority to invest tax proceeds.

The complaint against the real estate broker gave him reasonable notice of the charges against him. There was sufficient evidence to support the fact that the poor conditions existed in the apartments, and the evidence did not clearly direct another conclusion.

The court considered, inter alia, its standard of review, whether the assessment procedure complied with the Illinois Revenue Act of 1939 (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 482 et seq. (1971), and whether the company's appraisals were valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In contesting the assessments, the company offered appraisal reports prepared by an independent organization, which reports were based on the reproduction cost of a model replacement plant. In its rulings, the trial court had &quot;corrected&quot; the appraisals. On appeal, the court noted that it had no power to review the tax valuations, which had been fixed by the appropriate officers, in the absence of a showing of actual or constructive fraud. The court held that the assessment procedure complied with the Act. The Act did not require the assessor to determine full value before determining assessed value, and the assessor did determine the full value. Reviewing them one by one, the court held that none of the trial court's corrections of the company's appraisal reports was erroneous. Given that holding, the court did not have to address the company's argument that the assessments violated Ill. Const. of 1970, art. IX, &sect; 4(b). In light of the trial court's sound reasons for applying a &quot;rule of reason&quot; to the assessments rather than a per se rule, the court could not say that the company had proved by clear and convincing evidence that the trial court erred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois), which found that Rockford, Ill., Sign Ordinance &sect;&sect; 3-76(a) and (d) unfairly discriminated against mobile signs and entered an order permanently enjoining enforcement of those subsections, but upheld the general validity of the ordinance. Plaintiff mobile-sign rental companies cross-appealed, contending that the ordinance was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance represented a comprehensive regulatory scheme covering signs used in outdoor advertising. The trial court upheld the general validity of the ordinance but found that Rockford, Ill., Sign Ordinance &sect;&sect; 3-76(a) and (d) were arbitrarily underinclusive because they did not apply to other signs that posed substantially the same safety and aesthetic problems as mobile signs. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment enjoining enforcement of those sections and affirmed the finding that the general ordinance was constitutional. The distinction between mobile signs and other types could conceivably be justified on several grounds, and arguably rested upon a legislative determination that mobile signs posed greater safety and aesthetic problems. Mobile signs were more readily moved into unauthorized locations which could have posed traffic hazards than were other types of signs, and the differential ease of enforcement was found to be a rational basis upon which to make regulatory classifications. The terms were definite enough measured by common understanding and practice, and a reasonable basis existed for treating mobile signs differently from other signs.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers argued that proper notice of the hearing on the ordinance was not given and the boundaries of the area were not designated by a proper and correct legal description. The court held that it did not think that any interested persons were unjustly deprived of notice of misled by the error in referring to the northeast quarter of section 13.

The trial court ruled that good cause was required to unseal the record. The adoptee amended his petition alleging that adulthood was in of itself good cause. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the adoptee's argument that the statute violated his right to receive information under the First Amendment was without merit because the First Amendment did not guarantee the adoptee special access to information not available to the public generally. The court ruled that, although the adoptee's interest in his records was important both socially and psychologically, the statute did not violate the adoptee's right to privacy because he failed to prove that his right to the information was explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the constitution. The court held that the statute's requirement of a court order to view birth records did not subject the adoptee to any invidious discrimination and that the statute was fairly and substantial related to a legitimate state interest and only placed a reasonable limitation on access to the sealed records; thus, there was no violation of the Equal Protection clause.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-14(a)(1) (1977) and the sentence of a term of 30 days, asserting that (1) she was not proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) the prostitution statute is unconstitutional, (3) she was prejudiced by the admission of testimony concerning prior offenses and (4) her sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police officer placed defendant under arrest after she propositioned him. On appeal from her conviction for prostitution, the court affirmed, holding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-14(a) (1977) did not violate: (1) her due process rights by defining an inherently inchoate offense as a specific substantive offense; (2) her right to equal protection of the law; (3) her right to freedom of speech, or (4) Ill. Const. art. 4, &sect; 8(d), providing that bills shall be confined to one subject. The trial court did not commit prejudicial error by admitting evidence of offenses other than the offense for which she was being tried. While questions concerning whether she and her companions were prostitutes did not contain evidence of other specific crimes and was erroneous, it did not prejudice her case. Because the evidence of her character was introduced by defendant, the trial court's refusal to sustain defendant's objections was harmless error. In view of defendant's record of five prior convictions for prostitution and one conviction for aggravated battery, and the latitude given to the trial court in sentencing, it did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was discharged after she drove an automobile in a parade through the village. The parade was in support of a candidate for village trustee in an upcoming election. The employee's discharge was based expressly upon a village ordinance authorizing the dismissal of any village employee that had taken an active part in a campaign for elective office for the village. The employee initiated a suit for wrongful discharge, and the trial court ordered the village to reinstate the employee and pay back wages. The village appealed, claiming that the ordinance serving as the basis for the discharge was constitutional and was not beyond the authority delegated to the village by the general assembly. The court affirmed, holding that the village ordinance was void for vagueness and therefore unenforceable because the language adopted therein was too broad and vague for ordinary people of common sense to understand which activities were prohibited. The court found that the village had failed to adopt an ordinance which clearly and specifically apprised its employees of which political activities on their part would be grounds for dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a bar fight. He sucker punched the victim. Everyone heard glass breaking before the punch but no one saw glass in defendant's hand. The victim's face was cut. When police arrived at the bar, the victim told one of them that he had been cut by glass. The victim did not say this at trial, but the police officer testified to the victim's statement. When defendant was taken into custody he was asked how he came to have blood on his hand. He said he cut his hand on a motorcycle while going over railroad tracks. He did not mention the fight or his theory at trial, self-defense. The prosecutor commented in closing argument on defendant's failure to mention self-defense during the in-custody statement. The court held that this was reversible error. Defendant was not asked about the bar fight, but about his hand. No assumption arose that defendant would explain the fight when asked only about his hand. The court did not have enough information to determine whether the victim's statement to the police officer was admissible under the spontaneous declaration exception to the hearsay rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 80th General Assembly had passed two amendments to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 63, para. 14, which increased the salaries of the 81st General Assembly. The Ill. Const. of 1970, art. IV, &sect; 11, prohibited a change in legislative salaries from taking effect during a legislative term for which the members had been elected, but had not taken office, as of the date of passage of the law. The taxpayer contended that a general election had to intervene between the adoption of the law increasing salaries and the date upon which it took effect. The court found that the action was not moot because funds were available for the granting of effectual relief to the parties. It reviewed the language in art. IV, &sect; 11, &quot;the term for which he has been elected,&quot; and found that it referred to the current term for which the members of the General Assembly were serving and not to their continuance in office.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonresidents filed a class action against defendant city seeking a declaratory judgment, an injunction, and an accounting, alleging that the city discriminated against the nonresidents by charging them higher water rates and that the discrimination violated equal protection. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the city's motions to dismiss. The nonresidents filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted a water ordinance that provided that the nonresidents pay 25 percent more for water. The city filed a motion under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 45, 48(1)(i) (1977) to strike paragraphs of the complaint and to dismiss based on affirmative matter defeating the claim. On appeal, the court found that the city could have asserted that it had a rational basis for the classification scheme under &sect; 48(1)(i) to defeat the nonresidents' claim of denial of equal protection because the nonresidents were not members of a suspect class and were not asserting the denial of a fundamental right. However, this allegation was not an affirmative matter under &sect; 48(1)(i) because the rational basis test was not applicable to the common law right preventing unreasonable discrimination in water rates. The question of common law discrimination for a utility was always a question of fact based solely on the evidence presented. The court held that the contract alone did not establish a rational basis for the classification. It was improper for the trial court to strike certain paragraphs of the complaint because each paragraph did not have to state a complete claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the grant of dismissal for the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois) judgment on jury verdict for arson, attempted arson, and theft by deception. He challenged the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress the tape recording of his conversation with an informant two years after the arson and the sufficiency of the arson indictment, and alleged certain errors at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife were indicted for arson, attempted arson, solicitation and conspiracy to commit arson, and theft by deception, for burning down their apartment buildings. Their trials were severed. At defendant's trial, one arsonist testified he had been solicited by a third man to participate in the arson, which the two of them had done. He also testified on cross that he had never spoken with defendant until two years after the fire when he tape recorded a conversation for the State. The defense motion to suppress the recording on that basis was denied. Defendant challenged the eavesdrop petition and order, which resulted in the tape. He noted that the state's claim he met with the arsonist 10 times had been rebutted by the arsonist at trial. He also claimed the prosecution improperly cross-examined his wife and the defense was improperly limited in its cross of the arsonist on bias. The appellate court affirmed. There was ample cause to believe defendant's participation might have been the subject of conversation with a co-participant even two years later. The eavesdrop issue had been waived by failure to raise it before trial. There was no error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Unnecessary delay had waived the suppression issue. Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake were insufficient to attack the affidavit; the arson count of the indictment was not deficient. There was no reversible error in the prosecutor's cross-examination of defendant's wife or limiting cross-examination of the arsonist as to his bias.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois), which held on remand that defendant had waived the right to a jury trial. Defendant had been convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 8 to 24 years in prison. The People contended that there was no appealable order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether defendant waived the right to a jury trial. At a hearing on the waiver issue, the trial judge and the prosecutor testified that defendant waived a jury trial. The appeal notice stated that the appellate issue was the conviction, and that the date that the sentence was imposed was the date of the order that found a jury waiver. The court affirmed the judgment. Because the conviction was to be affirmed if the remand proceedings were proper, res judicata did not apply. The appeal notice was not defective enough to remove the court's jurisdiction because the People did not claim to have been prejudiced from the defects. Under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 329, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 329 (1977), the burden of proof on remand was on the People as the seekers of the amendment and the trial court erred here. However, defendant now had to show more than this error because he was not prejudiced, and the finding that the prosecutor and the trial judge were more credible remained. The People did not have to demonstrate that a document supported the amendment because the amendment sought did not contradict the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retiree appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which affirmed a decision of defendant board denying him a supplemental annuity as provided in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 5 -- 167.2 (1975). He contended that the statute, as signed by the governor, contained a printing error and that he was entitled to a supplemental annuity under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retiree retired in 1967 from the police department at age 43 after serving 20 years. His length of service qualified him for a pension. The statute provided a supplement to the pension for policemen who retired before September 1, 1976, at age 50 or over with 20 years of service. The numbers 6 and 7 were transposed in the version of the bill signed by the governor. The bill the legislature passed said September 1, 1967. That was the clear legislative intent, as it did not change the date from prior versions of the statute. The court held that the statute should have read September 1, 1967. The retiree met two of the three statutory requirements. He retired before September 1, 1967 with 20 years of service, but he was not age 50 or over at retirement. Therefore he did not qualify for the supplemental annuity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury was impaneled to investigate improper intelligence activities of a police department. The grand jury found that the police had assaulted the fundamental freedoms of speech, association, press and religion as well as the constitutional right to privacy of hundreds of individuals, but did not return indictments and instead forwarded the names of the individuals for administrative action. The parties argued that a class action was an appropriate remedy, the grand jury's report was essential to its case, and the misconduct of the police presented a situation, which dictated that a disclosure of grand jury transcripts be made in the furtherance of justice. The parties also argued that the need to maintain public confidence in the police and public officials constituted a particularized need. The court held that denial of the report was proper because the parties failed to meet their burden of explaining why the discovery process was not sufficient to allow them to gather the evidence or at least make a more structured request rather than requesting the full report. The public policy against disclosure of grand jury proceedings was stronger than that for discovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court found that the provisions of the ordinance, which the trial court had voided, were not independent of the ones, which it had held valid. The court concluded that the village officials would not have adopted the ordinance without the invalid provisions. It held that the invalid provisions were not severable from the remainder of the ordinance and, thus, the entire ordinance was invalid. The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that additional evidence should have been allowed to show that the village had harassed and discriminated against the cemeteries. The court found that the parties had entered a stipulation that depositions would be treated as evidence because no other facts would be submitted.

The court affirmed the judgment and found that neither the United States nor the Illinois constitutions provided such a right. Ill. Rev.

The court found that defendant was aware of the charge against him and of the elements of that offense. Neither during the trial nor in the post-trial motion did defendant claim that the state failed to prove either of the alternative methods of committing a battery, which was the defect in the indictment. The indictment apprised defendant of the precise charge with sufficient specificity to enable him to prepare his defense. The court held that defendant's conviction for aggravated battery could be successfully pled as a bar to future prosecutions that arose out of the same conduct. The state's violation of Ill. Sup. Ct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated kidnapping and rape. The trial court denied defendant's request for post-conviction relief, which was based on the denial of a pre-trial hearing pursuant to &sect; 5-2-1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-2-1 (1973). The court reversed those convictions on appeal and remanded the action for a new trial. The court concluded that the associate judge wrongfully interpreted Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 295, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110A, para. 295 (1971), as requiring him to vacate his pre-trial grant of a fitness hearing. The court also held that there was a bona fide doubt as to defendant's fitness to stand trial and that failing to observe the procedure that was designed to protect his right to not be tried while unfit deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial. The court further opined that dismissing defendant's appeal of his conviction was equivalent to filing of no appeal at all because there the court did not consider any of his claims and that precedent showed that, due to his failure to appeal, res judicata did not bar defendant from seeking post-conviction relief for the alleged constitutional errors.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the state failed to follow proper procedure in procuring the wiretap warrant. The court found that the procedures the state followed were more than adequate to satisfy the safeguards contemplated by statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 108-A-1 (1977), which required authorization of the state's attorney for an eavesdropping application. Defendant argued that the rules of evidence were violated when a transcript of the tape was admitted into evidence. The court found that any error in the admission of the transcript was harmless where the jury had an opportunity to listen to the tape and where defendant used the transcript to present his theory of the case and to impeach prosecution witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempt sale of federal food stamps under para. 11-24 and he appealed. He urged that the State had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt either his specific intent to commit the crime or a substantial step toward the commission of the crime. He also claimed that the overly broad statute was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that para. 11--24 made it a criminal offense to sell or exchange food stamps with some other person for another article. The court noted that the storeowner had testified that defendant asked him if he wanted to buy food stamps. After the storeowner declined the offer, defendant persisted, saying that he needed the money. The court held that this testimony established defendant's intent to sell food stamps. It further ruled that defendant's asking the storeowner if he wanted to buy food stamps constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the crime of selling food stamps. Thus, it held that the State had met its burden of proving attempt. The court declared that the statute was not unconstitutionally broad, as it rationally outlawed only unauthorized food stamp transactions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the board had jurisdiction to reconsider its earlier order dismissing the complaint against the correctional officer because the board had not issued a final and appealable order. The court determined that the board's findings were supported by the manifest weight of the evidence and that the correctional officer's conduct was sufficient cause for discharge even though the conduct occurred while he was off duty. Finally, the court held that the board's rules differentiating between suspension not to exceed 30 days and suspension pending discharge were neither unreasonable, violative of its rule-making authority, nor inconsistent with Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court, in a declaratory judgment action, found that the village's annexation of the owners' property was valid, but that the village's zoning classification of the property as commercial and multiple family was arbitrary and capricious.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment in part. The court found that plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of proving that the classification was arbitrary and capricious, noting that the evidence merely demonstrated that the property could have been zoned either single-family or commercial. Noting that plaintiffs had done no more than demonstrate a difference of opinion concerning the reasonableness of the classification, the court found that the legislative judgment was conclusive. The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that the annexation was void because the owners were not the owners of record when they signed the annexation petition, noting that the annexation statute, Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former husband petitioned to terminate future maintenance payments to the former wife because she had been cohabiting with another man. The trial court granted the petition, ruling that the wife's conduct had amounted to cohabitation on a resident, continual conjugal basis under &sect; 510(b). The wife appealed, alleging that &sect; 510(b) did not apply because the parties' marital separation agreement had delineated the circumstances in which maintenance could be terminated. The court reversed, explaining that the parties' settlement agreement was irrelevant because the terminating events in &sect; 510(b) were mandatory. Thus, &sect; 510(b) applied to the petition. However, the court reversed because the trial court had misconstrued &sect; 510(b). While not approving of the wife's living arrangements, the court concluded that her conduct did not fall within the provisions of &sect; 510(b) and that not every conjugal cohabitation justified termination of maintenance. The wife had resided with her male friend for only four and one-half months and intended to move to the marital home with her children. Thus, the court could not say that her cohabitation had been continuous within the meaning of &sect; 510(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer's license was suspended for failure to post a surety bond or its equivalent based on a percentage of its gross sales. The Director filed an action to enjoin the dealer from operating a grain dealership without a license. The trial court granted the Director judgment on the pleadings. The dealer's principal contention was that the bonding provisions of An Act to License and Regulate Grain Dealers, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111, para. 303 (1977) were unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the classification based on gross sales bore a rational relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose. The legitimate state purpose of the Act was to safeguard producers from the bankruptcy of grain dealers. The legislature may have decided that it was rational to first protect against bankruptcies by small dealers and that a dealer who did a large volume business indicated some degree of sound management and customer confidence. Referencing the amount of the bond to sales volume appeared to be a rational approach.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pollution Control Board (Illinois) granted respondent corporation's motion to dismiss petitioner attorney general's complaint alleging that the corporation caused or allowed the emission of sound beyond the boundaries of its motor vehicle racing facility so as to cause noise pollution in violation of certain state statutes and regulations. The attorney general appealed the Pollution Control Board's (board) order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the pendency of the board's hearings concerning the attorney general's complaint, the Environmental Protection Act (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 1001 et seq. (1977), was amended so as to totally exempt certain sporting events from noise emission standards and limitations. The board's order of dismissal was predicated on the amendment to the act, which essentially provided that without an endorsement from one of certain private organizations, any motor racing event had to comply with the board's noise pollution standards and regulations. Moreover, in granting the corporation's motion to dismiss, the board did not consider the attorney general's arguments concerning the alleged unconstitutionality of the amendment. On appeal, the attorney general again argued, inter alia, that the amendment unconstitutionally delegated legislative power. After rejecting the corporation's argument that the attorney general lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the amendment, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The amendment improperly delegated to private groups the right to determine which events would be exempt from the act and which would not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed from a declaratory judgment issued by the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which, in plaintiff landowners' suit, found that a special service area was properly created by the city, but which enjoined the city from passing ordinances for the issuance of bonds or the levy of annual taxes for special services without holding further hearings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city council adopted an ordinance proposing establishment of the service area, and sent notice of the hearing to all persons in whose name the general taxes for the last preceding year were paid on each parcel of land lying within the special service area. The landowners argued that the notices were improperly sent, that the form of the notice deprived them of due process, that a sufficient number of objections in each category was filed, and that the city erred in determining the number of objections filed by the electors and property owners. The trial court determined those issues in the city's favor, but found that both the ordinance proposing and that establishing the service area included only the maximum amount of bonds which could be issued and only the maximum rate of taxes which could be extended, and were thus illegal and invalid. The court held that the notice given was not appropriate to the combined proceedings which both formed the special service area and purported to advise the landowners of their obligation, and that the notice was not sent to all persons owning real estate or taxable personalty as required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 1304 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded the case with directions that there be further hearings limited to the right of owners of real estate and electors in the service area to object to the issuance of bonds in the amount specified and the levy of taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable companies entered into contracts with public utilities to lease space on utility poles in order to string transmission cables. The cable companies sought to enjoin the ICC from exercising jurisdiction over the pole attachment agreements. The trial court ruled that the ICC had the authority to regulate the agreements under &sect; 27. The court affirmed and held that because the ICC had the power to regulate leasing activities, it was under the mandate to assure that the charges were just and reasonable. The ICC had the basic duty to protect the utility and the public. Therefore, it was reasonable that the ICC was given jurisdiction over pole attachment rates in order to insure that persons desiring to use the facilities bore reasonable shares of the costs incurred by the utilities in maintaining and owning them. The ICC had been given authority to regulate, among other things, the lease or other encumbrance of the whole or any part of its equipment. The poles were tangible personal property that were necessary to fulfill the utilities' duties. Therefore, considering a proposal to lease or encumber any part of them properly belonged to the ICC and required its approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Madison County (Illinois), which, upon the complaints filed by the city, found him guilty of committing a nuisance at two separate locations, a violation of Collinsville, Ill., Code &sect; 9.16.140.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated a sanitation service, which consisted of garbage and trash collection and buying and selling scrap iron, metal, and similar items. A city police officer went to defendant's residential and business properties on two separate dates and observed a variety of items scattered about the premises. The city filed complaints against defendant alleging that he had committed a nuisance on the properties by permitting or maintaining an unsightly yard in violation of the city's nuisance ordinance. Defendant was found guilty. The court affirmed. The court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The ordinance was clearly related to the public health; thus, it was a permissible exercise of the city's authority. Moreover, the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the city's police power, as it did not prohibit sanitation services or junk yards, but required that all property be maintained in a sanitary manner. Defendant made no showing that he could not have conducted his business without violating the ordinance. The jury's finding that a nuisance in fact existed was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. There was no basis for a claim of selective prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village sought a variance from compliance with the barium limitation standard established by Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules and Regulations, chapter 6, Public Water Supplies, Rule 304B(4).

However, the board failed to consider the issue of the validity of the challenged regulation, Rule 304B, as applied to the village. Further, the court noted that the record was insufficient for the court to review the order.

The court held that the absence of co-counsel during jury venire was not prejudicial as other competent counsel was present and that the exclusion of jurors for their beliefs on the death penalty did not make the jury more conviction prone. The court further held that defendant's behavior was not motivated by insanity to justify the killings under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 9-1(b), and his sentence of natural life was not unconstitutional because the aggravating circumstances warranting its imposition were not vague and ambiguous.
