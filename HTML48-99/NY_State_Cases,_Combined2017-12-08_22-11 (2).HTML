</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 special proceeding, petitioner individual sought to compel respondents, the City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and its commissioners, to issue a senior citizen rent increase exemption order (Order) freezing the rent for her apartment at the maximum collectible rent (MCR) rate for the month prior to her 62nd birthday. The HPD had previously denied her request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual, who had lived in her apartment more than 20 years, turned 62 on January 15, 1987. She received a MCR notice increasing her rent, effective January 1, 1987. On January 27, 1987, the individual applied for an Order from HPD. That application was denied because the individual was not 62 on the day the MCR took effect. The court held that the application should have been granted and remanded it back to the HPD. The court reviewed the HPD's administrative decision to determine if it was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7803. The court found that the purpose of the rent regulation, New York City, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 26-405(m) was to alleviate hardships on senior citizens over 62 with low incomes. Because the statute was remedial in nature, the court construed it literally in order to carry out its purpose. The court, analogizing to an action that arose under an eviction prevention statute, found that the rent regulation statute required the HPD to issue an Order once the individual reached the age of 62. Because the individual was 62 when she applied for the Order, the HPD's denial of her application was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the individual's petition to compel HPD to issue a rent control order and remanded the action back to HPD for further determinations consistent with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, who turned 62 on January 15, 1987, 15 days after the maximum collectible rent increase took effect, was improperly denied a senior citizen rent increase exemption order (SCRIE Order) freezing the rent for her apartment at the rate of her maximum collectible rent for December 31, 1986 on the ground that she was not 62 at the time the rent increase took effect since the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development must issue a SCRIE Order once an applicant meets all the statutory criteria (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 26-405 [m] [2]).  The purpose of the statute is to alleviate hardships on senior citizens over 62 with low incomes created by escalating rents in New York City.  Such a remedial statute should be construed in order to carry out the reform and to spread the beneficial results as widely as possible.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Through a motion to vacate, petitioner, an owner of property subject to real estate taxes, sought a judgment declaring an increase in the assess valuation of the property to be void and unenforceable as violative of petitioner's constitutional rights. Further, petitioner sought a judgment restoring the assessed valuation to its former level. Respondent Commissioner of Finance of the City of New York filed a cross-motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite having failed to reveal his interest in the property by neglecting to file an owner's registration card upon purchasing the property, as required &sect; 1512 of the New York City, N.Y. Charter, petitioner contended that respondent's valuation assessment was arbitrary and capricious. The court, however, noted that notice of the valuation had been sent to the parties from whom petitioner purchased the property, who were the only publicly known owners as they had, during their term of ownership, filed an owner's registration card. Given that respondent's provision to insure notice was ignored by petitioner, the filing of a real property transfer tax return by petitioner was not sufficient notice that petitioner was the owner of the property. Therefore, he was not entitled to contest any increase in the assessment. The filing of a transfer tax return had never been held to be chargeable notice of ownership to the municipal subdivision responsible for promulgating notices to property owners. Accordingly, dismissal of the petition was warranted, as no arbitrary conduct was perceived and the notification requirements were properly interpreted and followed by respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's motion to vacate, and granted respondent's motion to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Filing Owner's Registration Card in New York City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner was not deprived of due process by the failure of the City of New York to notify it of a change in assessed valuation before the increased assessment became final since it was petitioner's failure to file an owner's registration card with the City Collector following its purchase of the subject property in 1987 that caused the city to send the requisite 10-day notice to the former owners then listed with the City Collector at the time of the assessment (NY City Charter &sect; 1512).  Consequently, it cannot be said that respondent arbitrarily disregarded petitioner's right to notification of the assessment increase.  Petitioner's filing of a transfer tax return with the City Register is no substitute for filing an owner's registration card and cannot constitute constructive notice to the city of a change in ownership for purposes of the notification of an assessment increase.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applicant filed a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 seeking a judgment reversing and annulling the findings by respondent Nassau County (county), which denied the applicant's request for disability retirement and benefits. The applicant sought a declaration that &sect; 71 of the New York Civil Service Law in conjunction with &sect; 605 of the New York Retirement and Social Security Law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was employed as a school crossing guard by the county police department when she sustained an injury during the course of employment. As a result of the injury, the applicant was granted workers' compensation benefits and was placed on sick leave of absence without pay. The applicant subsequently requested disability retirement benefits pursuant to New York Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 605, and the hearing officer denied her request. Pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, the applicant petitioned for a judgment to reverse and annul the denial, as well as a declaration that &sect; 71 of the New York Civil Service Law in conjunction with &sect; 605 of the New York Retirement and Social Security Law was unconstitutional. In denying the applicant's petition and granting the county's cross motion for dismissal, the court noted that &sect; 71 of the New York Civil Service Law did not require a pretermination notice and hearing. Holding that both &sect; 71 of the New York Civil Service Law and &sect; 605 of the New York Retirement and Social Security Law were constitutional, the court found no violation of the applicant's rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the applicant's petition to reverse a decision denying her retirement benefits and for declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of a section of the New York Civil Service Law.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Accidental Disability Retirement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner's application for disability retirement filed on September 24, 1986 as a result of a job-related accident which occurred on September 10, 1984 (the date she was last paid on the payroll before being placed on sick leave of absence without pay) while she was employed as a school crossing guard by the Nassau County Police Department was properly rejected as untimely since it was not &quot;filed within three months from the last date the member was being paid on the payroll or within twelve months of the last date he was being paid on the payroll provided he was on a leave of absence for medical reasons without pay during such twelve month period provided the member was disabled at the time he ceased being paid&quot; (Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 605 [b] [2]).  The fact that petitioner was on sick leave without pay and paid for nine holidays per year while not working, pursuant to her union contract, does not change the fact that petitioner was not paid on the payroll. Furthermore, the statute governing reinstatement of employees after they were separated from service due to a disability caused by a work-related injury (Civil Service Law &sect; 71) does not require a pretermination notice and hearing.  Holding a posttermination hearing afforded petitioner all the due process to which she was entitled.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for an evidentiary hearing in criminal proceedings charging defendant with possession of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arraigned and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance. Defendant moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that his arrest and prosecution constituted selective prosecution in violation of the New York Constitution and the United States Constitution. In the alternative, in order to further substantiate his claim, defendant requested an evidentiary hearing to determine if his arrest was motivated by improper considerations, and to determine the ordinary disposition of similarly situated offenders. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and motion for an evidentiary hearing, holding that defendant failed to show that his arrest and prosecution were invidious or based upon impermissible considerations, and that defendant failed to show that he was more likely than not to succeed on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motions, holding that defendant failed to establish necessary elements to show selective prosecution in criminal proceedings against him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Arrest -- Selective Prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, a high school principal charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree (Penal Law &sect; 220.03) who has allegedly been offered a less favorable plea as compared to other first offenders prosecuted under the same statute because of the policy of the Manhattan District Attorney's office to consider &quot;the defendant's position in the community as a relevant factor in plea discussions&quot;, has failed to establish that his arrest and prosecution were based upon unconstitutional considerations such as race, religion or any other arbitrary classification. Since defendant, as a school principal, occupies a position of public trust, a legitimate interest is served through his prosecution in promoting a more general compliance with the law.  Since defendant has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he has been unfairly singled out for prosecution, he is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of selective prosecution.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner residents sought judgment annulling a determination of respondent county attorney, who determined that the residents' proposed amendment to the county charter was illegal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents submitted petitions for a referendum on their proposal to the county charter to substitute a system of weighted voting by a board of supervisors in place of the existing single-member-district legislature. The county attorney determined that the proposal was illegal under Suffolk County, N.Y., Charter &sect; C7-3B. The court vacated the determination and declared the proposed amendment legal and proper. The suggestion that a weighted voting system had to, of necessity, effect a dilution of minority voting in violation of the Voting Rights Act was wholly undocumented. The mere suggestion of a violation, standing alone, was insufficient to arrest the initiative and referendum process at birth. The claim that the proposal would have allowed for insufficient time to prepare a plan went to the merits of the proposal, not its legality. The proposed amendment fell outside the temporal limitation of N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 10 and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court also held that the geographical requirement contained in Suffolk County, N.Y., Charter &sect; C7-3 was unconstitutional in that it did not employ the least drastic means necessary to achieve its ends.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent Suffolk County Attorney improperly determined that petitioners' proposed amendment to the County Charter, providing for the replacement of the existing single-member-district Legislature with a system of weighted voting by a board of supervisors, is illegal and thus cannot be submitted to the voters since the United States Supreme Court has not invalidated all systems of weighted voting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Board of Estimate v Morris</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 489 U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 109 S Ct 1433) nor is respondent's undocumented suggestion that a weighted voting system would effect a dilution of minority voting in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 sufficient to arrest the initiative and referendum process at birth.  In addition, since the proposed Charter amendment can take effect no earlier than January 1990 and since the districts comprising the Suffolk County Legislature were altered last in 1981, the proposed amendment falls outside the temporal limitation proscribing any effort to restructure a local legislative body more than once each decade commencing with 1970 (Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 [1] [ii] [a] [13] [f]).  Lastly, the Charter's geographical distribution requirement for the initiative and referendum process requiring the signatures of at least 50 voters from each of the county's 10 towns (&sect; C7-3) is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant's conduct was not the kind of conduct that the statute seeks to prevent.  The statute was intended to enhance the Family Court Act provisions controlling the acts of adults which are likely to result in neglect or delinquency of children where Family Court proceedings would be inappropriate for that purpose, and to aid in the prosecution of those who would take advantage of young persons, particularly young female runaways; traditionally, prosecutions under the statute have dealt almost exclusively with sexual offenses or morals cases.  The statute fails to give a reasonable person subject to it notice of the nature of what conduct is prohibited and what conduct is required of him or her, and is, accordingly, unconstitutional.  In any event, the statute would not be applicable in this case since the People failed to prove that defendant had any degree of control over the complainant which would enable her to take advantage of the complainant.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each charged with one count of criminal trespass for illegally entering and remaining in a private office belonging to a commissioner of a city health department. Defendants were members of a group focusing attention on the AIDS crisis. Defendants raised a justification defense, claiming their action constituted a necessary emergency meeting held for the purpose of saving lives.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants, members of a gay activist organization who entered unannounced and uninvited into the office of the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Health, disrupted an ongoing meeting, screamed epithets and slogans and otherwise prevented the Commissioner from engaging in his scheduled business to protest a recent report of the Department reducing the number of persons estimated to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, the precursor to AIDS, have failed, as a matter of law, to offer sufficient evidence to support a justification defense (Penal Law &sect; 35.05 [2]) to the trespass charges against them since defendants offered no proof that the issuance of the report created an imminent emergency to anyone's life other than their personal beliefs that it might; they offered no proof that the report would have any immediate impact on funding for AIDS health care nor did they offer substantive proof that the report would even have such impact in the future.  In addition, even if defendants believed the report contained erroneous conclusions which needed immediate correction, the actions they took were not reasonably designed to accomplish the goal of changing the report.  Defendants cannot use the necessity defense to justify unlawful action intended to limit the advancement of ideas contrary to their own.  Accordingly, since defendants were each personally warned that they were trespassing and each refused to leave after being lawfully ordered to do so, they are found guilty of criminal trespass in the third degree (Penal Law &sect; 140.10).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The author of the book at issued was prosecuted for the death of an individual. The foundation was involved with the publishing of the book. N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 632-a affected the rights of the perpetrator of a crime to receive any profit from communications concerning the crime unless and until all proceeds had been held in escrow for five years and made available to satisfy any civil judgment obtained against the wrongdoer. The victims assistance organization determined that the book at issue was subject to &sect; 632-a. The foundation argued that the victims assistance organization did not comply with due process requirements, and the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the victims assistance organization's proposed determination contained a detailed statement of the issues involved in the controversy, thus providing adequate notice of the nature of the proceeding and not offending due process. The court also found that to the extent that the statute inhibited the U.S. Const. amend. I, the statute's burden on speech was narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

The statute is not violative of First Amendment rights since the State's interests in providing a source of funds to compensate victims of a crime who might otherwise have no source of redress and in barring a given perpetrator from reaping a potential windfall from the publicity generated by a particularly controversial or infamous crime significantly outweigh the minimal impact on the dissemination of information.  In addition, the mere possibility that the statute might be applied to some protected expressive activity does not render the statute constitutionally infirm as vague and overbroad.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with public lewdness in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.00.

The court held that the state did not establish a case of public lewdness under the statute because there was no evidence of intent for the act to be viewed by the public. The evidence showed an attempt to be clandestine instead.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The heirs filed suit to enforce a right of reentry which provided that certain real property, granted to the fire company, would revert to the heirs in the event that the premises were no longer used to house a fire department. The fire company alleged that the premises were used as a fire department, and sought to have the restriction removed. The fire company further alleged that the reverter had been extinguished by N.Y. Real. Prop. Law &sect; 345(4), which required the heirs to file a declaration of intent to preserve the restriction within a specified period. After trial the court awarded title to the heirs. The court found little evidence of fire company activity on the premises: the utilities were disconnected, and the fire company's equipment and personnel were housed at a different location. The court rejected the modification argument because the grantor had clearly and unambiguously restricted the use of the land for a particular purpose. Finally, the court found N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 345(4)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it barred the reverter before the event that would trigger the reverter had occurred or the parties at interest had been identified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action to enforce a right of reentry against a volunteer fire department, inasmuch as defendant no longer used the conveyed premises to &quot;house a fire department&quot;, the land and building erected thereon should revert to the heirs of the grantors in accordance with the terms of the deed, and Real Property Law &sect; 345 (4), which required plaintiffs herein to file a declaration of intention to preserve a reverter not less than 27 nor more than 30 years after the condition subsequent or special limitation was created is unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Board of Educ. v Miles</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 15 NY2d 364); since the deed was recorded in 1949, the declaration would have had to have been filed not later than 1979, which was prior to the discontinued use of the parcel in question, the triggering event for the reverter to take effect, and, thus, plaintiff's failure to file the declaration of intention pursuant to an unconstitutional statute does not defeat the reversionary interest. Moreover, RPAPL 1955, which allows for the modification or extinguishment of certain restrictions on the use of land held for charitable purposes, is inapplicable, since the grantors herein specifically restricted the use of the land and defendant's use no longer conforms to the restriction; the purpose of the restriction was to insure that the land itself, rather than simply the value of the land, be devoted to housing a fire department. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city brought an action against defendants, owner and lessee, to close a property used as an unlawful gambling establishment. After the court issued a temporary closing order of the premises, the city filed a motion for an order, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6301 and New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 7-707, preliminarily enjoining the owner and lessee from the use and occupancy of the first-floor rear area of a building.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city submitted sworn affidavits from police officers attesting to the illegal gambling activity on the premises. The owner contended that issuance of a preliminary injunction violated its due process rights. The lessee argued that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 7-703(g) was unconstitutionally vague and that &sect; 7-706(g) improperly presumed an agency relationship between the owner or lessee and the operators of a public nuisance. The court granted the city's motion for a preliminary injunction to the extent of continuing the temporary restraining order contained in the order to show cause. The court found that the city made a sufficient demonstration of its right to and the necessity for a preliminary injunction to protect the public. The court rejected the owner's contention, as a judicial hearing on the merits provided adequate due process and that the closing order could be vacated upon a proper showing that the public nuisance had been abated. The court concluded that repeated illegal conduct on a particular property constituted a &quot;violation&quot; and, therefore, could be considered a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nuisance -- New York City Nuisance Abatement Law -- Preliminary Injunction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff City of New York is entitled to a preliminary injunction pursuant to the Nuisance Abatement Law (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 7-707) enjoining defendants from the use and occupancy of the first-floor area of a building where arrests were made on six occasions for illegal gambling activities since the minimal intrusion of defendants' rights are outweighed by the legitimate exercise of the police power to protect the public.  There is no denial of due process in view of the requirement that a judicial hearing on the merits be held within three days and the fact that the closing order may be vacated upon a proper showing that the public nuisance has been abated. The Nuisance Abatement Law is not void for vagueness for failure to clearly define the term &quot;violation&quot; since it is clear that where there is repeated illegal conduct on a particular property and that conduct violates what is sought to be protected under the law, there is a &quot;violation&quot; that may be considered a public nuisance. The statute is not violative of the lessee's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination since the statute clearly provides for rescission of the closing order upon proper showing, other than by testimony, that the public nuisance has been abated. </SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion. The court held that: (1) the provisions of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City Charter &sect; 436 and Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a (5) (a), which authorize warrantless &quot;administrative searches&quot; of automobile dismantling businesses, are violative of the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures extended to the citizens of New York through NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 12; although both statutes have been held not to violate the US Constitution 4th Amendment, States are free to interpret their own Constitutions in ways that afford their citizens broader protections than those offered under the Federal Constitution.  The statutes in question may be fundamentally defective in that they authorize searches undertaken solely for the purpose of uncovering evidence of criminality, rather than enforcing a regulatory scheme. Accordingly, statements made by defendant, the operator of a licensed automobile dismantling business, and the search conducted by the police pursuant to a subsequently obtained search warrant were by-products of the illegal search and seizure conducted pursuant to the statutes in question, and must be suppressed as fruits of the poisonous tree. </SPAN></P>

The court found that the commission had failed to demonstrate a rational basis for the distinction between state employees and legislative employees in view of the statutory purpose of the Ethics in Government Act. The court concluded that the commission had failed to adequately demonstrate a constitutional basis to distinguish between state officers and state employees and those who had previously worked for the legislature.

Plaintiff has a substantial property interest in his entitlement to practice law, and defendant State Ethics Commission has failed to demonstrate a rational basis for the distinction between State employees and legislative employees in view of the statutory purpose of the Ethics in Government Act (L 1987, ch 813), which amended section 73 in order to restore public trust and confidence in government; if the purported purpose of the Ethics in Government Act is to regulate the &quot;revolving door&quot; syndrome, certainly members of the Legislature and their employees engage in that activity to no greater or lesser degree than former State officers or employees, many of whom were not political appointees but civil servants.  </SPAN></P>

Respondent adoption agency met with the birth father at the birth mother's home and obtained his consent. The birth father had concealed the pregnancy from his family. The adoption agency failed to inform the birth father of any of his rights; it merely obtained his consent.

The court first held that the birth father's consent was invalid; however, his consent was not required pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The consent to adopt an infant given by his unmarried, minor father was not valid where the adoption agency which procured the consent failed to exercise the extraordinary care demanded in dealing with a minor who lacks the assistance of a parent or guardian.  The meeting with the agency should have included a discussion of the planning alternatives available to the father and should have encompassed a full explanation of his legal rights, including the right to consult an attorney and the right to take a copy of the consent document home to reread and reflect upon.  Although the father did understand that by signing the document he would be giving the child up for adoption, the father's consent cannot be held to be knowing and voluntary in the absence of some showing that he had been made aware of the options open to him, and the social worker's attempt to draw the father out by asking him to discuss the profile of the adoptive parents does not substitute for an effort to find out how the father felt about the proposed adoption itself.  Moreover, petitioner was genuinely confused and assumed that he had 30 days in which to revoke his consent; the fact that the meeting was conducted in such a fashion that there was a substantial likelihood that a person of the father's age and circumstances would become confused or pressured invalidates the consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Consent of Unmarried Minor Father</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The consent to adopt an infant is not required from an unmarried, minor father who met none of the three criteria set forth in Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e), and the mere fact that the adoption agency sought his consent is no concession that it was required.  The father did not live with the child or his mother for six months preceding the adoptive placement; he did not openly hold himself out to be the father, and he made no contribution whatsoever towards the birth expenses, making only minimal loans or gifts of money to the mother during the pregnancy. Although the father asserted that he proposed marriage to the child's mother and suggested that they live together in his parents' home, the insincerity of that proposal was apparent in view of the father's adamant refusal even to tell his parents of the pregnancy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the consent to adopt a child is not required by an unmarried, minor father who met none of the criteria set forth in Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e), the father retains standing to petition for custody of the child and the court must apply the best interest of the child standard in the adjudication, without any presumption in favor of the father; the fact that the father's consent is not required should put him on an equal footing with a parent who has executed a valid consent to adoption </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Social Services Law &sect; 383 [6]).  There is no question that the infant's best interests will be served by his adoption by the preadoptive couple. The father has nothing to offer a child; he is a high school dropout without even a part-time job; he has shown no capacity to nurture another human being, is emotionally immature, and would actually have the child raised by his mother, notwithstanding the fact that his family is dysfunctional in ways which bear directly upon its parenting capacity.  The preadoptive couple, by contrast, have good educations, good jobs, and a lovely home, and exhibited extraordinary compassion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a child custody proceeding in which an unmarried, minor father seeks to revoke the consent he gave to free his child for adoption, petitioner's testimony concerning his resistance to going to a meeting with representatives of the adoption agency lacks credibility and leads to the conclusion that no duress or coercion was used to secure petitioner's presence at the meeting where the adoption documents were signed.  The alleged threat that petitioner's parents would be told that he had fathered a child, if it was said at all, was not so fear-inspiring as to override the exercise of petitioner's free will.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a child custody proceeding in which an unmarried, minor father seeks to revoke his consent to free his child for adoption, inasmuch as the consent of a qualified father is required under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e) regardless of whether the father is an adult or a minor, it appears that the statute does contemplate that a minor father of an out-of-wedlock child can consent to his child's adoption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e), which sets forth three criteria which must be met before the consent of the father of an out-of-wedlock child need be obtained in order to place a child out for adoption, is not unconstitutional as applied to an unmarried, minor father who did none of the things which were well within his power to assert his interest in the child.  The father failed to consult with his parents, failed to obtain a part-time job to help out financially, and failed to forthrightly and consistently declare to the child's mother his desire to raise the child; on the contrary, the father took the approach that the pregnancy was her problem and that he would not interfere in whatever she decided to do about it, giving no indication that he was prepared to inconvenience himself in the slightest for the sake of establishing a relationship with the child.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees, who operated horse-drawn carriages, requested judgment declaring that the licensing code was unconstitutionally vague because the provision for the display of the license was not clear. The court denied the licensee's motion for summary judgment, and granted the city's cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The licensing statute was not void for vagueness even though city inspectors differed in construing the provision for display of the license. An intelligent licensee, and any inspector possessing common sense, could determine that the provision that the license be posted in a conspicuous place meant that the license was to be displayed openly and notoriously. The lapse of time between the offense and a hearing could make it more difficult for the licensee to present evidence, but did not rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation because there was an adequate opportunity for the ultimate judicial determination of liability. Inspections of the horse-drawn carriages without prior notice was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because unannounced searches conducted were necessary to further the city's regulatory scheme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A declaratory judgment action is the proper vehicle to review the validity of a legislative act; it is a proper vehicle for invalidating an unconstitutional application of a statutory provision.  The exercise of a power which offends against the Constitution may be attacked at any time, and defendant agency cannot give legality to an unconstitutional or void statute by exercising power under it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A statute which is so vague that people of common intelligence must necessarily speculate as to its meaning in the absence of some comprehensible standard or guide cannot pass constitutional muster; however, the fact that people may differ in construing a statute or in applying it does not mean it is void for vagueness. A statute is void only if it specifies no guide or standard at all, but not if there is a comprehensible normative standard capable of interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Animals -- Regulation of Horse-Drawn Cabs -- Display of License</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding challenging the constitutionality of a municipality's regulation of horse-drawn cabs, the terms in Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect; 20-375, &quot;securely affixed&quot; and &quot;conspicuous and indispensable&quot;, which describe the manner in which a license is to be displayed, are not arbitrary and vague, but have plain meanings, i.e., that the license must be openly displayed and not hidden.  It is not necessary that the statute specify the precise location for display of the license as long as it meets the requirements of visibility and permanence, giving the carriage owner some flexibility to determine the best location and means for attachment, depending on the nature of the carriage on which it is displayed; such flexibility cannot be equated with impermissible vagueness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Animals -- Regulation of Horse-Drawn Cabs -- Procedural Due Process -- Time Lapse between Offense and Hearing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding challenging the constitutionality of a municipality's regulation of horse-drawn cabs, although a large lapse of time between allegedly committing an offense under the regulations and the hearing on a citation may make it more difficult to recollect the circumstances or to round up witnesses by the carriage owner, that fact does not amount to an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.  Given the existence of a three-year Statute of Limitations for the exaction of penalties or forfeitures imposed by statute (CPLR 214 [2]), the serving of a notice of violation within months of the alleged offense is not repugnant to any sense of fundamental fairness; a governmental agency is not required to bring charges instantaneously upon the discovery of a violation.  Moreover, licensees are required to maintain their records for a three-year period, so it should not be so difficult for them to establish compliance with departmental requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Animals -- Regulation of Horse-Drawn Cabs -- Unannounced Inspections</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding challenging the constitutionality of a municipality's scheme for regulating horse-drawn cabs, the municipality's practice of conducting inspections without prior warning does not violate a cab owner's right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures since there is a substantial government interest that informs the regulatory scheme pursuant to which the inspection is made: horse-drawn cabs may create traffic hazards and be environmentally burdensome; moreover, treatment of the animals must be on a humane basis, and the general public is not to be victimized.  Unannounced and spot searches are necessary to further the regulatory scheme </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 20-371); such inspections can serve as an effective deterrent, and advanced notice of inspection would frustrate that scheme.  The statute under which inspections are conducted meets the constitutional requirements as to notice and scope; Administrative Code &sect; 20-378 specifies regular inspections at least once every four months, and Administrative Code &sect; 20-377 provides that the objective of the inspection is to determine if the horse-drawn cab is fit for operation.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town charged defendant by information with violations of Hempstead, N.Y. Code &sect; 78-41 prohibiting the use of beach chairs without the approval of the concessionaire.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town established a special park district and operated and controlled a beach club. One of the rules and regulations issued with regard to the use of beach club property by a resident of the park district prohibited the use of beach chairs that were not rented from the concessionaire. On four separate occasions, defendant brought his own beach chairs to the club for his family of nine children. The town charged defendant with violation of Hempstead, N.Y. Code &sect; 78-41. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that the part of &sect; 78-41 regulating the use of beach chairs at the beach club by the concessionaire was an unreasonable use of police power as it violated the Due Process Clause of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The People offered no evidence to explain the necessity for a restriction on privately owned beach chairs only at the beach club. There was no evidence that there ever had been any beach chair-related injuries at the beach club, or at any other public beach operated by the town.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A portion of a local ordinance prohibiting the use of privately owned beach chairs at a municipal beach is unconstitutional and an unreasonable use of the police power since the statute's mandated method of implementing the safety goal asserted by the municipality is prohibitively expensive to local residents, who must rent beach chairs from a concessionaire who enjoys an exclusive contract with the municipality, and is too dubiously related to that goal; moreover, the prohibition created by the statute is so excessive that it interdicts otherwise legitimate activity, and there is an absence of any legislative finding or any other demonstration by the People that there exists a reasonable relation to the prohibition established by the law and the public good. Defendant, who was charged with violating the ordinance, has met his burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the law is an arbitrary abuse of the police power. </SPAN></P>

The court found the reasons given by the defense in utilizing its peremptory challenges were not racially neutral.

A prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination is not rebutted by a mere statement of racially neutral reasons for the challenges, and the court should consider: the racial context of the case, i.e., whether there is any perceived advantage to excluding a particular race from the jury; a past pattern of discriminatory practices by the attorney; whether the stated explanation is an assumption about a particular group that does not apply to the particular juror challenged; whether other similarly situated jurors were also challenged; disparate questioning of challenged and unchallenged jurors; whether the challenged jurors were questioned on voir dire about the purported reason for the challenge; and counsel's own statements of a preference for jurors of a particular race.</SPAN></P>

Although other reasons were advanced for excluding the jurors, the court finds them to be pretextual where defense counsel made assertions regarding the &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de facto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [segregation]&quot; of the jurors' neighborhood without offering any evidence of that &quot;fact&quot;.  Moreover, no questions were asked of the white jurors to determine if they actually harbored prejudice against the black defendant, who was accused of attempting to murder nine white and Hispanic police officers, and similar responses by whites and blacks to questions concerning a prospective juror's knowledge of the case or his prior victimization&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by criminals elicited different treatment by defense counsel, who believed the blacks and disbelieved the whites.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with driving while intoxicated in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1192(2), (3). The second defendant was also charged with reckless driving in violation of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1190. At their arraignment, the court exercised its discretion provided under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 510(3), which allowed for discretionary temporary suspension of a driver's license during the pendency of a prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the temporary suspension of defendants' driving licenses pursuant to &sect; 510(3) required a balancing of their property interests in their licenses and the state's interests in regulating highways and reasonably restricting licenses. The court noted that the suspension was only temporary and set out the factors that it considered. The court rejected a temporary suspension upon an arraignment for driving while intoxicated based solely on a high blood alcohol reading. A temporary suspension had to be grounded on evidence that a driver's continued operation of a motor vehicle represented a danger to the public. It entailed a review of the arraigned charges and defendants' driving record. The first defendant's blood alcohol reading was 0.20 and he had been twice convicted of driving while intoxicated. At the time of the charged offense, he was currently on felony probation and driving on a conditional license. The second defendant's blood alcohol reading was 0.20, and he was charged with reckless driving charge because his vehicle had collided with the arresting officer's patrol car. He had been convicted for driving while intoxicated, and his license was revoked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 510 (3), which allows for the discretionary temporary suspension of a driver's license during the pendency of a prosecution, may properly be invoked when there is evidence that a driver's continued operation of a motor vehicle represents a danger to the public; it is inappropriate to invoke the discretionary temporary suspension solely on the basis of a high blood alcohol reading upon an arraignment for driving while intoxicated. It should be noted that a temporary suspension is only for the pendency of the criminal proceeding, whose duration is limited by the speedy trial provisions of CPL 30.30.  Accordingly, in two unrelated prosecutions for driving while intoxicated, the driver's license of each defendant is suspended pursuant to section 510 (3) where each driver had a history of alcohol-related offenses, had high blood alcohol readings, and, thus, posed a threat to the public by continued operation of a motor vehicle. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state official filed an action against respondent federal official, seeking a declaratory judgment that all federal tax refunds held by the federal official for a period in excess of seven years on behalf of persons, whose whereabouts were unknown and whose last known addresses were in the State of New York, should escheat to the State of New York. The federal official filed a motion to dismiss the state official's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state official argued that the law, 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6408, which precluded the state from collecting any refund from the federal tax returns of persons who had disappeared and whose last known addresses were in the State of New York, was unconstitutional. The state official argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it was not a necessary and proper exercise of the federal government's taxing power. The court rejected the argument and pointed out that the words &quot;necessary and proper&quot; were not limited to such measures as were absolutely and indispensably necessary but they included all the appropriate means that were conducive or adapted to the end to be accomplished and that, in the judgment of Congress, would most advantageously effect it. However, the court noted that 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6408 was only to be applied prospectively and, thus, the state official was entitled to pursue those claims that had accrued prior to the enactment of the federal statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that the state law relied on by the state official was unconstitutional and unenforceable to the extent that it sought to escheat unclaimed federal tax refunds. The court also declared that the federal law that prohibited the state from escheating unclaimed tax refunds applied prospectively only.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That portion of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, effective December 22, 1987, amending the Internal Revenue Code so as to prevent any attempt by a State to escheat unclaimed Federal income tax refunds (26 USC &sect; 6408), is a constitutional, valid exercise of Congress' power since the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Congress in determining whether the law defeating State escheat laws is a necessary and proper exercise of its undisputed powers to enforce the Internal Revenue Code and administer undeliverable refunds. Therefore, Abandoned Property Law article XII-A, being at odds and inconsistent with the Federal statute, is unconstitutional and unenforceable to the extent that it seeks to escheat unclaimed Federal tax refunds that are the subject of the Federal statute.  However, since the Federal statute may only be applied prospectively from its effective date, any Federal tax refunds held by the Federal Government, which would otherwise escheat to the State, to which the rightful owner has not made claim for seven years prior to December 22, 1987, shall be paid or delivered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the State Comptroller (State Finance Law &sect; 95).

The court found that tests performed on the voting machine that demonstrated that it had failed to record votes on the Republican's line, in combination with the discrepancy between the number of votes received by the Republican and his running mate and the fact that the overwhelming percentage of registered town voters were Republican, permitted the inference that the Republican received more votes than the Democrat. Noting that the testimony of voters as to how they had voted was competent evidence in a quo warranto proceeding, the court admitted into evidence and credited the sworn statements of 147 voters that they had cast their votes for the Republican.

The affidavits of the electors are admissible as to how they voted in an action in quo warranto brought by the Attorney-General to try title to public office (Executive Law &sect; 63-b) since the right to examine voters in such an action is in affirmance and vindication of the essential principle of the elective system.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Department of Social Services exceeded its authority and was arbitrary and capricious in terminating the enrollment of petitioner, the proprietor of a pharmacy, as a Medicaid provider by purportedly requiring and denying reenrollment pursuant to 18 NYCRR 504.5 (a) (13), which lists as a criterion for denial of reenrollment &quot;any other factor having a direct bearing on the applicant's ability to provide high-quality medical care * * * or to be fiscally responsible&quot;, since that criterion is inappropriate to sanction the deficiencies alleged against petitioner, viz., that no pharmacist had been on duty for three hours on the date the pharmacy was inspected, that a purchaser's name had not been entered on a prescription, that two outdated drugs were in the refrigerator, and that there was poor site accessibility to the handicapped.  Although 18 NYCRR 504.5 (a) (13) may provide an appropriate standard for new enrollees, it lacks standards that are adequately explicit to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement against established providers; the vague language of paragraph (13) contrasts unfavorably with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  18 NYCRR 504.5 (a) (1)-(12), which rely upon a finding of fraud or misfeasance and the failure to cure after notification, or criminal charge or conviction, and thus inhibit arbitrary rejections of applicants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc.

The People opposed defendant's motion and filed a cross-motion for an order amending the court's decision. The court denied defendant's motion. Section 65 differed from the vulnerable witness statute at issue in the United States Supreme Court decision. Section 65 was constitutional because the trial court was required to make an individualized finding that a particular witness fell within the ambit of children the statute was designed to protect, and the image of defendant during the trial would be before the vulnerable witness by way of simultaneous television transmission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance brokers claimed that they had standing to bring their action because it was illegal for the HPD to indemnify a contractor against claims that arose as a result of the contractor's negligence. They asserted that the indemnification provision violated N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect;&sect; 5-322.1, 5-323, which declared void and unenforceable certain types of agreements whereby a person exempted himself from liability for his negligence. The effect of the indemnification provision was to make the city the liability insurer of the contractor. The court held that although the indemnification provision appeared to violate the literal wording of the statutes, there was nothing in the public policy behind their enactment that was violated by the provision. Neither of the sections was violated by the subject contract provision. Further, no state funds or property were involved and there were not facts that alleged a fraudulent or wasteful use of public funds. Thus, the brokers lacked standing to bring a taxpayer suit.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the partners did not carry their burden of demonstrating any actual infringement of, or burden upon, their legitimate associational rights and organizational activities protected by the U.S. Const. amend.

Any further investigation by petitioner at this stage must be construed as seeking to uncover criminal violations of the Election Law in the Poughkeepsie elections and such information is not material to the purposes of the Commission to investigate &quot;weaknesses in existing laws, regulations and procedures relating to campaign contributions and campaign expenditures, and determine whether&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  such weaknesses create an undue potential for corruption, favoritism, undue influence or abuse of official position or otherwise impair public confidence in the integrity of government&quot; ( Executive Order No. 88.1 [9 NYCRR 4.88]).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holdover tenant filed a motion to dismiss the building owner's eviction action on the grounds that he was protected under the Loft Law, N.Y.

Both parties stipulated that the sole dispositive issue was whether the amended law was constitutional. The court held that it was valid because the legislature did not so usurp a prohibited power as to overcome the presumption that the legislation was constitutional. The court held that the statute did not impermissibly intruded on the &quot;property, affairs, or government&quot; of New York City because the state could pass a statute that effected local concerns if the issue was sufficiently important. Neither was the amendment an impermissible &quot;special law,&quot; because, the court held, the statute impacted all members of a &quot;rationally defined class.&quot; Thus, it was a valid &quot;general law&quot; despite the fact that only a few apartments were members of the class; nor was it subject to the &quot;two-legislative-session approval provision,&quot; N.Y.

In support of his motion, he contended that the N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act. &sect; 424-a (b) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a foreign divorce, the husband was ordered to pay alimony and child support. Thereafter, he petitioned the court for a decrease in his support obligations. After his petition was granted, the wife in turn petitioned for an increase in support. The matter came before a hearing examiner and the husband failed to provide the hearing examiner with a statement of net worth as required by N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act. &sect; 424-a. The hearing examiner in turn granted the petition on the basis of the wife's submitted statement, and took no testimony from the husband. The court held that the husband's failure to comply with the hearing examiner's direction to file a net worth statement was an admission of his ability to pay if the wife established her right to an increase. The effect of &sect; 424-a was thus to prohibit the husband from offering any evidence in his own behalf in opposing petitioner's demand for an increase. Because the amount demanded in the wife's petition was not liquidated, the court in turn determined that a hearing was required. The hearing examiner's order was thus vacated and the matter remanded for a hearing in accordance with the court's directions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Use of a declaratory judgment action for purposes of testing the constitutionality of CPL 730.40 and 730.60 (6) is proper since a declaratory judgment action is often used to test the validity on constitutional grounds of a statute; although plaintiffs may have an adequate remedy through habeas corpus relief, which can also test the constitutionality of the statutes, there have been numerous attempts in prior writs to raise the issue of the involuntary confinement in mental institutions of persons accused of crimes, but when the writs were granted on other grounds and the individuals released from commitment or their status converted to civil commitment, the issue of the constitutionality of the statutes was dismissed as moot.  Declaratory relief, however, is a remedy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sui generis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and escapes both the substantive objections and procedural limitations of special writs and extraordinary remedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fitness to Proceed to Trial -- Involuntary Commitment in Mental Institution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In spite of the presumption of constitutionality of statutes,&nbsp;CPL 730.40 and 730.60 (6) and 14 NYCRR 540.3, which provide for the involuntary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  confinement in mental institutions of persons accused of crimes, are unconstitutional as applied to those found incompetent to stand trial and whose charges have been dismissed; CPL 730.40 provides for the dismissal of charges against persons accused of misdemeanors but allows commitment for a longer period of time than under a civil commitment even though the charges have been dismissed.  The statute creates two classes of incompetents and permits a means of involuntarily committing an individual without the constitutional safeguard provided in the Mental Hygiene Law of proof of the need for commitment by clear and convincing evidence. Once the criminal charges were dismissed against plaintiffs, who are challenging the constitutionality of the statutes in a declaratory judgment action, they should no longer have been subject to the criminal justice system.  Although a constitutional distinction has been allowed for those who have been found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, since their dangerousness has been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt by the act of violence for which they were committed, such determination of dangerousness was never made with respect &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to plaintiffs, who were committed subject to an administrative rule setting forth a belief that they are prone to violent propensities and subject to a release requirement that any change in status must be approved by various doctors, along with onerous notice requirements to the police and District Attorneys.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for a mistrial in the court based on the prosecutor's use of gender-based peremptory challenges to eliminate women jurors, following defendant's indictment for burglary, grand larceny, criminal mischief, and harassment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant requested that a mistrial be declared because the prosecutor exercised his peremptory challenges to eliminate women jurors. The court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial because the court was satisfied that the prosecutor provided reasons independent of gender for the challenges. The court held that the state statutory and constitutional provisions relating to a jury trial and the right to be a juror as well as the state Equal Protection Clause precluded the use of gender-based peremptory challenges. The court concluded that defendant had standing to attack the use of peremptory challenges against women on state equal protection grounds because defendant met all of the requirements vesting him with third-party standing. The court further concluded that the Batson test should have been applied to evaluate assertions of gender-based use of peremptory challenges. The court determined that the prosecutor's failure to justify on grounds independent of gender two of the nine peremptory challenges did not warrant a finding of improper use of peremptories. Accordingly, the court found that the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges was not unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State statutory and constitutional provisions relating to jury trial in a criminal proceeding and the right to be a juror, as well as the State Equal Protection Clause, preclude the use of gender-based peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Scope of State Right to be Juror -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In resolving the question of whether it is permissible for a prosecutor to use gender-based peremptory challenges to the composition of a petit jury, because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v McCray</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (57 NY2d 542), which rejected a claim that the New York State Constitution's guarantees of a jury trial and of a judgment of one's peers prohibited use of peremptory challenges to exclude black jurors from the venire from which the petit jury was selected, reviewed only the language of the State jury guarantees, after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v P. J. Video</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (68 NY2d 296), which stated that State constitutional provisions may be broader than Federal constitutional provisions, a State trial court may appropriately reconsider the scope of the State right to a jury trial and the State right to be a juror. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Accordingly, the history of New York State unequivocally established that since 1937 the Legislature's policy was to eliminate preclusion of women's participation on Grand and petit juries, and an application of a noninterpretive analysis, which is an effort to discover preexisting State law and traditions defining the scope of an individual right, and any distinctive attitudes of the State citizenry toward the protection of that right, provides a particular and specific New York effort against exclusion of women jurors. Therefore, the restrictive view of New York law applied in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">McCray</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is no longer viable after the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">P. J. Video</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The history of the State prohibition on gender-based conduct in jury selection is not limited to selection of the jury pool, but extends to selection of the jury from that pool. If a jury clerk deliberately sent a panel of all men or all women to a courtroom for the selection of the petit jury, such conduct would be just as unlawful as the selection of the pool by genderbased exclusion; it must follow that deliberate use by the prosecutor of peremptory challenges&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to eliminate jurors based on gender is also unlawful under statutes passed which withdrew male gender as a qualification for jury service </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Judiciary Law &sect; 500).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Principles of statutory construction require a reconciliation between an 1873 statute providing for peremptory challenges in criminal trials and 1937, 1938 and 1977 statutes which make otherwise qualified citizens and residents eligible to be jurors whatever their sex, and give every defendant a right against gender-based exclusion of people from his or her jury; accordingly, inasmuch as the Legislature did not intend to do away with peremptory challenges when it ended gender-based discrimination in jury selection, peremptory challenges must be used in a manner consistent with later legislation precluding exclusion of women based solely on gender. Consequently, peremptory challenges cannot be used to exclude jurors based solely on gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect;&sect; 2, 6; art VI, &sect; 18) protects against the exclusion of women from &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  juries based solely on gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Under State law, a male defendant of one group can challenge the exclusion of a juror in another protected group; therefore, a male defendant in a criminal proceeding may challenge the exclusion of women from the petit jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The State Equal Protection Clause (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11) renders gender-based peremptory challenges of the members of a petit jury invalid since gender-based conduct must be substantially related to an important governmental objective with exceedingly persuasive justification, and there is no justification for excluding a man or a woman as a juror because of gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A man has standing to attack on equal protection grounds the use of peremptory challenges against women in selecting a jury to determine the criminal charges against him.  Moreover, a defendant meets all the requirements vesting him with third-party standing where he made a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claim of injury to his right to a jury selected without gender bias; he can assert an injury to himself which derives from the denial of the jurors' equal protection right not to be challenged based on gender. The jurors are unable to protect their interests since they are unaware of the colloquy relating to the challenges, are unaware of the existence of the requisite pattern for raising the challenges, cannot intrude on the criminal proceedings because they are not parties, and have little ability to pursue an independent time-consuming challenge to the litigants' conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Federal Principles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Under the Federal protections deriving from either the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses or the Sixth Amendment Impartial Jury Clause as applied to the States, gender-based peremptory challenges to the composition of a petit jury in a criminal case are unconstitutional.  The Equal Protection Clause restricts government action based on gender, whether the policy affects men or women, and the restriction on gender-based activity necessarily requires the principles of raceneutral &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  jury selection enunciated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Batson v Kentucky</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (476 U.S. 79) to be applied to gender-based peremptory challenges to jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Gender-Neutral Explanation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Once a defendant in a criminal proceeding makes a prima facie showing that peremptory jury challenges are gender-based, the prosecutor must come forward with gender-neutral explanations for the challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Federal Principles -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Under principles of Federal equal protection, a defendant may challenge the use of peremptory jury challenges based on gender or other suspect class even if the defendant is not a member of the same group as the excluded jurors; a person has a right not to be excluded from jury service because of membership in a particular group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Federal Principles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Inasmuch as an essential component of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is that the petit jury be selected from a representative cross section of the community, a defendant need not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be a member of the challenged group to seek a remedy for denial of the opportunity to have a jury composed without the prosecution's use of gender-based peremptory challenges; defendant is entitled to participation of the excluded group and to the range of qualities of human nature and varieties of human experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. The test to be applied to evaluate assertions of the improper use of gender-based peremptory challenges should be the same one used to evaluate race-based peremptory challenges, i.e., one must show that members of a cognizable group were challenged and that the circumstances must give rise to an inference that the challenges were used to eliminate potential jurors because of membership in that group; should such a showing be made, the party exercising the peremptory challenges must provide neutral reasons unrelated to group membership to justify the challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Prima Facie Showing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. Defendant has made a prima facie showing that the prosecutor used gender-based peremptory challenges where the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prosecutor challenged 9 women and only 1 man from a panel consisting of an unusually high number of men; the single woman left as a juror was allowed to remain only after defense counsel repeatedly noted his objection to the prosecutor's conduct, and the men who were not challenged disclosed information about themselves similar to the women who were challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Neutral Explanations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. In ruling on the propriety of the prosecution's use of gender-based peremptory challenges, gender-neutral explanations were not provided by the prosecutor with respect to one juror who was allegedly &quot;shy and timid and would not be comfortable with the relationship between the complaining witness and the defendant&quot;, since that explanation was pretextual, as was the explanation regarding another witness who was challenged because of &quot;her inattentiveness to questions and the prosecutor's inability to make eye contact with her&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Jurors -- Challenge to Jury -- Gender-Based Peremptory Challenges -- Mistrial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. In a criminal proceeding in which defendant alleged that the prosecutor improperly used gender-based&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  peremptory challenges, the motion for a mistrial is denied because the failure to justify on grounds independent of gender 2 of 9 challenges does not warrant a finding of improper use of peremptories. </SPAN></P>

The court also noted that legislative enactments were entitled to a strong presumption of validity and that the challenged statute only had to afford a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that the contemplated conduct was forbidden and also had to have provided explicit standards to avoid arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An adoption proceeding premised upon the voluntary surrender of the child by the natural mother at birth wherein the adoptive parents, both attorneys, falsely stated in the verified petition that &quot;there are no persons other than those hereinbefore mentioned interested in this proceeding&quot; when they knew that the putative father had commenced a proceeding in Family Court to establish his paternity before the child was born (a determination of paternity having subsequently been made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">[see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Baby Girl S</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 140 Misc 2d 299]) must be dismissed because of fraud and misrepresentation. In addition, the refusal of the unwed father to consent to the adoption of his daughter would require the dismissal of the petition in any event.  The unwed father demonstrated his desire for a caring and ongoing relationship with his child and satisfied 2 of the 3 statutory criteria necessary to require his consent to the adoption by commencing paternity and custody proceedings, filing with the Putative Father Registry upon learning of the birth of the child and offering support.  The fact that he was unable to fulfill the third criteria of having &quot;openly lived with the child&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or the child's mother for a continuous period of six months immediately preceding the placement of the child for adoption&quot; (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 [1] [e]) because of the unwillingness of the mother cannot deprive him of his constitutional right to the companionship, care and custody of his child.  To rule that no unwed father has a right to prevent an unwed mother from placing their child for adoption immediately at birth would create an invidious gender-based distinction between the rights of unwed fathers and unwed mothers.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied the city's application as a well-intentioned but unconstitutional executive encroachment on civil rights. The city failed to show its widespread need to conduct the wholesale police invasions. The proposed search went far beyond the reasonable goals of regulation, appeared to seek to enforce laws relating to records that had not been enacted, and was unnecessarily intrusive as a self-enforcing equivalent of an arrest warrant. In the absence of statutory authority for the administrative inspections, the court declined to use its inherent powers to issue an order on the constitutionally defective application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents sought a declaratory judgment that the student was a state resident and thus was eligible to attend school for free. The parents boarded the student with an in-state family, and for a time lived in the family's town. When the parents moved out of state, the school district claimed that the student effectively moved with them even though he physically remained where he was. The school district accordingly began demanding tuition payments. The court held for the parents, finding that although it was customarily the case that a school student was presumed to reside with his parents, that was not the case with students described by N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3202(4)(b), which included a class of children whose residence was their boarding home. Since the student actually resided in the school district and had almost never physically resided with his natural parents, he was a state resident and thus tuition payments were not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with felony drug crimes and he entered a guilty plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. The district attorney subsequently filed a forfeiture action against defendant. The court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint.

Defendant did not waive his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as to any felony counts charged against him in the forfeiture action by reason of his plea to the unspecified misdemeanor. Those rights continued. Since the procedure under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 13-A required defendant to answer drug-related felony charges by admitting or denying them at the risk of a judgment by default against him, it denied defendant the protection against self-incrimination provided under the Fifth Amendment and was unconstitutional.

The District Attorney, by permitting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant to plead to a misdemeanor in satisfaction of the drug-related felony count, cannot, as a matter of due process, completely ignore the plea bargain and bring a forfeiture action more than two years after entry of the plea based upon the dismissed felony count or another drug-related crime that was never charged but is now alleged to have arisen from the same transaction.  In addition, the forfeiture action would be dismissed in the interest of justice in any event ( CPLR 1311 [4]).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the commissioner's regulation requiring the distributor to pay handling fees to dealers and redemption centers with which it did not have agreements was a proper exercise of its rule-making authority and that the requirements that the distributor accept empty containers sold by them even though they did not receive the initial deposit were not arbitrary and capricious and did not violate its right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regulation of the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation requiring distributors of beverages to pay handling fees on returnable containers to dealers and redemption centers with which they do not have express agreements (6 NYCRR 367.6) is a proper exercise of the Commissioner's rule-making authority, and the requirement that distributors accept empty containers of every kind sold by them even though they did not receive the initial deposit is not arbitrary and capricious and violates no right of such distributors to due process of law. Inasmuch as the Returnable Container Act ( ECL, art 27, tit 10) requires distributors to accept returns from redemption centers with which they have agreements as well as from those with which they have no agreements, there is no valid reason to require handling fees in one instance and not in the other; moreover, assuming that distributors are adversely affected by the regulation, the mere fact that regulatory legislation imposes a heavy, or even an unequal, financial burden is not a sufficient basis for judicial relief. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner not-for-profit corporation instituted a claim for funds earmarked for the not-for-profit corporation , and specifically appropriated over a period of three years by the state legislature. Respondents Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) and the Division of the Budget moved for a judgment pursuant to N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the issue presented was whether the not-for-profit corporation could enforce payment of undistributed moneys appropriated under the member item system by the state legislature. The court held that the not-for-profit corporation failed to meet its burden of establishing its entitlement to relief upon the alleged enforceability of Green Book allocations for the fiscal years 1985-1986 and there was no evidence presented to the court which is even suggestive of an appropriation for 1986-1987. Furthermore, the court agreed with the contention of the DHCR and the Division of the Budget that the sole remaining claim was purely contractual, and could be brought only in the Court of Claims. Finally, that portion of the petition which sought a letter confirmation from the DHCR and the Division of the Budget of the fact that two loans were forgiven by law was denied, as there was no showing that writing such letters was a mandatory act that the DHCR and the Division of the Budget were enjoined to do under the law. Therefore, the court denied the not-for-profit corporation's petition and granted the DHCR and the Division of the Budget's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner not-for-profit corporation cannot enforce payment of undistributed moneys appropriated under the member item system by the State Legislature, where petitioner bases its entitlement to such moneys on an allocation of a lump-sum appropriation contained in the &quot;Green Book&quot;, the Report of the Fiscal Committee on the Executive Budget, which is prepared and submitted to the Governor by the Chairmen of the Senate Finance Committee and of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, since the allocations in the &quot;Green Book&quot;, taken together with the budget lump-sum appropriations and the subsequent passage of the budget into law, do not establish the absolute entitlement of petitioner to the funds as a matter of law; when the lump-sum appropriations are signed into law, the power of the Director of the Budget does not become simply ministerial, since such an interpretation would vest legislative committees with the power reserved to the executive branch of segregating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lump-sum appropriations. Moreover, if the Governor's line item veto power could be circumvented by the mere use of the &quot;Green Book&quot; device, then the executive branch would be effectively deprived of its role in overseeing and implementing programs funded by the Legislature, and would render the approval function of the Director of the Budget a rubber stamp.  Accordingly, where questions of propriety are raised concerning a specific member item, which have led to a criminal investigation, the beneficiary of that allocation has failed to show that the State respondents are under a mandatory duty to fund the appropriation, and the petition is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant instituted a motion to dismiss a count of aggravated harassment in the second degree as violative of his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Defendant was charged under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.30(3) after he struck a man and shouted ethnic slurs at him. Section 240.30(3) regulated violent conduct and physical intimidation when committed intentionally and because of racial, ethnic, or religious prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 240.30(3) violated his freedom of speech and equal protection rights. The court disagreed and denied the motion to dismiss. The intent of the law was to prohibit violence based upon bigotry. The statute did not attempt to prohibit bigotry itself, merely violent conduct. Such regulation was a valid exercise of police power because there was a reasonable relationship between the public welfare and the prohibition of such conduct. Thus, no valid First Amendment issue was raised. Even if defendant's behavior were to be deemed expressive, however, it would not have been entitled to First Amendment protection because the subject speech was properly considered &quot;fighting words.&quot; If &sect; 240.30(3) did incidentally inhibit speech in some cases, the statute was narrowly drawn to the degree required to restrict speech only in cases that involved acts of violence of physical intimidation. Finally, there was no equal protection violation because the legislature had a rational basis for the classification in the statute, namely, the prevention of bias-related violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was charged with aggravated harassment in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [3]) in that he allegedly struck the complainant while shouting ethnic slurs, and his motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that the statute violates his rights to freedom of speech and equal protection of the laws under the US Constitution (1st, 14th Amends) is denied.  No First Amendment issue is raised since the intent of the statute is to prohibit violence and physical intimidation based upon bigotry. Even if defendant's behavior were considered expressive, violent demonstrations are not protected under the First Amendment, and constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech do not prevent States from punishing &quot;fighting words&quot;, those by which their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.  There is a compelling governmental interest in penalizing bias-related violence which is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and the statute is narrowly drawn to apply only to those situations involving acts of violence or physical intimidation. The legislative determination to classify&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bias-motivated harassment as a class A misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail, while classifying similar conduct involving harassment not based upon the race or ethnicity of the victim as a noncriminal offense punishable by no more than 15 days in jail, was a rational one, given the increasing problems of bias-related violence. Furthermore, there is a rational basis for the Legislature to have concluded that the measure was necessary to redress past discrimination.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with having violated &sect; 27-217. Defendant contended that he was unable to recognize or understand that his conduct was in violation of law because there were no fixed standards in the Administrative Code that differentiated an office from a store. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court determined that it was clear that &sect; 27-217 afforded adequate notice that one must first obtain a new certificate of occupancy before changing a use to one not permitted by the existing certificate. The court concluded that neither the Administrative Code nor the pleadings should have been considered vague because they did not define or explain the words &quot;office&quot; and &quot;store&quot; because these words were commonly used and understood. The court noted that, when served with a notice of violation, defendant had ample warning that the city believed that he was acting illegally, and that his failure to obey the order would have constituted a prosecutable offense. The court explained that defendant's apparent inaction could only be regarded as a voluntary and calculated risk.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, neither the statute nor the pleadings should be construed as vague because they do not define or explain the words &quot;store&quot; and &quot;office&quot; since those words are commonly used and understood.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appropriate, constitutionally mandated standard for the involuntary admission of a mentally ill person for a 60-day period without a court order of retention pursuant to a two-physician certification (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 9.27) requires a determination that the person to be committed poses a real and present threat of substantial harm to himself or others since a showing of mental illness alone is insufficient to involuntarily confine a person to a mental institution. A finding that a patient poses a real and present threat of harm to himself or others may now be considered implicit in the findings contained in the preprinted Office of Mental Health admission forms that alternative forms of care and treatment have been considered and that the patient's judgment &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is impaired to such a degree as to be unable to understand the need for such care and treatment, but the facts establishing the element of dangerousness should be set forth in the physician's certification.

The Board directed all work at the subdivision to stop and directed petitioners to submit an application for review. Petitioners filed suit, seeking an order prohibiting the Board from exercising jurisdiction over the subdivision.

The court noted that &sect; 276(1) gave the Board review authority over plats where 20 percent or more of the lots within the plat were unimproved. Improvement did not include surveying or laying out of lots, the court ruled, but instead required a building or completed roads, sewers, water, electric and other capital improvements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, party to a family court proceeding as a mother of five infants, commenced contempt proceedings against judicial invitee, a reporter from the local daily press, who had published materials regarding closed proceedings in violation of a minimal restraining order. The reporter cross-moved for a reargument against the restraining order and dismissal of the contempt proceedings based on lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court proceedings concerned a matter commenced by petitioner, county department of social services, against the mother and were brought under the Fam. Ct. Act. Art. 10. The reporter had been invited to be present by the judge prior to the determination of whether to open the proceedings that were confidential and closed under the Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 1043,166. The reporter published an article regarding the proceeding while under a 22-hour injunction against publication. The court denied the motion of the mother for a professional misconduct investigation of the reporter, who was also present as legal counsel for the paper, because it lacked the authority. The court held that the order was valid and that the reporter and the paper he worked for willfully violated the restraining order. The court held that when the reporter and the paper ignored a court order that they believed constituted a prior restraint of their First Amendment rights they risked criminal contempt charges. Due to the uncertainties in the law regarding prior restraints of speech, the court determined that the violation was not deserving of punishment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A newspaper whose representative was invited to present legal arguments on the issue of whether the news media should be conditionally allowed to cover child protective proceedings against respondent, the mother of five young infants, is guilty of willfully violating a temporary court order restraining it from publishing information about the proceedings for 22 hours since the Family Court can set conditions and restrictions when permitting access to its &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;confidential&quot; proceedings (Family Ct Act &sect;&sect; 1043, 166; 22 NYCRR 205.4, 205.5) that the press cannot ignore as an unconstitutional prior restraint. However, given the uncertainty in the law regarding the collision between the rights of the press to be free of prior restraints and the obligation of the courts to see that their orders are enforced, the newspaper's violation was not culpable or deserving of punishment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were alleged to have prepared and filed falsified police forms, which resulted in one of defendant's sons receiving a sentence of probation, as opposed to incarceration, on a pending narcotics conviction. Presentation of the case to the grand jury was by the second special district attorney (second DA) appointed pursuant to N.Y. County Law &sect; 701. The charges initially surfaced as during an investigation by the Temporary State Commission of Investigation (commission). After first special district attorney (first DA) was appointed, the commission asked for the revocation of his appointment because it claimed that he had a conflict of interest with the commission. The appointment was revoked. Thereafter the second DA was appointed. Defendants contended that the appointment was illegal and unconstitutional. The court dismissed the charges against defendants, holding that the appointment of the second DA was a nullity because the revocation of the first DA's appointment was in excess of the commission's statutory authority, which tainted the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the indictment resulting from the presentation to the Grand Jury made by the replacement of the Special Prosecutor whose appointment was revoked must be dismissed since the second prosecutor's appointment was null and void, it having been made as a direct result of the improper disqualification of the first Special Prosecutor, and, thus, the second prosecutor was unauthorized to make a presentation to the Grand Jury. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff limited partnership filed a motion for summary judgment and defendant commissioner filed a cross motion for summary judgment. The limited partnership contended that the Real Property Transfer Tax amendment, N.Y. City Admin. Code &sect; 11-2102(b)(1), did not on its face apply to transfers of limited partnership interests, and application of the amendment to transfers of partnership interests violated the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A limited partnership did not own any real property itself, but was the sole limited partner in another limited partnership whose sole asset was a building located in New York City. The legislature enacted enabling legislation, under which the city amended its Real Property Transfer Tax law. Under the amendment, the city applied the tax to transfers of the limited partnership's interests. The limited partnership paid the tax and brought an action for a refund. The tax did not specifically apply to transfers of interests in an entity that did not itself own real property. The court invoked the substance-over-form rule to hold that the amendment did apply to transfers of the limited partnership interests. The legislature had intended to close a loophole in enacting the enabling legislation. The court held that sales of limited partnership interests were, in effect, sales of interests in the real property. The court held that the tax did not constitute an ad valorem tax prohibited by N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 3, nor did it violate the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the federal Constitution.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York City Real Property Transfer Tax, which, retroactive to July 13, 1986, imposes a transfer tax &quot;on each instrument or transaction * * * whereby any economic interest in real property is transferred&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 11-2102 [b] [1]), applies to plaintiff's syndication to limited partners in October 1986 of more than a 50% interest in itself when plaintiff did not own any realty in New York City, but was the sole limited partner in a partnership that did, since the two-tiered partnership device, whereby a shell partnership is created to separate title ownership from the entity in which the economic interests with respect thereto were transferred, may not be used as a tax avoidance device when the purpose of the statute is to tax transactions which effectively, but indirectly, convey real property. The sales of plaintiff's partnership interests were, in essence, the sales of interests in real property situated in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York City with the purchasers of the limited partnership interests obtaining their profits exclusively from revenues, capital appreciation and tax benefits attributable to the property and this is precisely the sort of transaction the statute was intended to reach.  Taxation of the transfers does not violate the constitutional prohibition against the imposition of an ad valorem tax on intangible personal property (NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 3) nor does it violate either the Commerce or Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution.  In addition, the five-month retrospective application of the statute is lawful since closing a perceived loophole in the law is a reasonable basis on which to legislate retroactively when the public was on notice at all times during the retroactive period of the city's intention to impose a tax on transfers of economic interests in real property. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with failing to provide, install, and maintain window guards on apartments they owned in accordance with N.Y. City Health Code &sect; 131.15 and N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 17-123. Defendants sought to dismiss the charges since the allegedly violated statutes were not published in the City Record and because of the alleged unconstitutionality of the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statutes in question made the failure to provide window guards a misdemeanor. Under the old law, a landlord could defendant himself by showing that he inquired with the tenant whether the tenant wanted the guards, but the tenant answered negatively or gave no response. The defense was no longer allowed if a landlord had actual notice of the need for guards. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. Strict liability criminal statutes in the area of public health and safety were lawful where there was clear legislative intent. The legislative intent was to protect children. State law did not preempt the statutes. The elimination of the landlord's defense did not create an irrebuttable presumption that the statutes were violated. The classification of all health code violations as misdemeanors was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power. Defendants did not have standing to challenge the classification of other health code provisions. Defendant's selective enforcement argument failed since they did not show that the statutes were deliberately applied unevenly based on an arbitrary classification. The new rules were not an unauthorized form of taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion to dismiss was denied. Window guard regulations were constitutional. Strict liability criminal statutes were lawful in the area of public health and safety. The elimination of one form of defense did not create an irrebuttable presumption of guilt. It was not unlawful to classify all health code violations as misdemeanors. The window guard statutes were not selectively enforced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City's &quot;Window-Guard Law&quot;, which requires the installation of window guards in apartments inhabited by children under the age of 11 (NY City Health Code &sect; 131.15; Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 17-123), is a strict liability criminal offense requiring no </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">mens rea</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since effective enforcement of a program designed to protect the lives of young children from accidental death and injury resulting from window falls would be illusory if intent were made an element of the offense.

The law does not create an irrebuttable presumption of guilt merely by virtue of the absence of window guards nor does the designation of every violation of a Health Code regulation as a misdemeanor constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the Board of Health.  Lastly, defendants' bare assertions that managers of city-owned housing are not prosecuted are insufficient to establish even a colorable claim of selective prosecution.  </SPAN></P>

They alleged that the state commission of investigation (SIC) in the course of their two-year probe of the county police department and district attorney's office, had committed specific acts and engaged in a course of conduct which, inter alia, have exceeded the SIC's jurisdiction, impinged upon the jurisdiction of the district attorney, and violated the constitutional and statutory rights of the assistant and others. For the most part, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief, but they also asked the court to review the report which was prepared by SIC prior to its release. The court denied the district attorney and bureau head's various requests for relief. The investigation complained of was squarely within SIC's legislative mandate. Since the SIC was not a judicial or quasi-judicial body, and its role was purely investigatory, there was no basis for judicial review of the SIC's report.

In a proceeding brought by a District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney against the State Commission of Investigation seeking a judgment declaring certain alleged conduct of the Commission unconstitutional or illegal, enjoining such conduct in the future, and prohibiting the Commission&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from taking any further action against petitioners, so much of the petition seeking relief in the nature of certiorari must be denied; since the Commission is not a judicial or quasi-judicial body, and its role is purely investigatory, there is no basis for judicial review of the Commission's report.  Petitioners' request for certiorari can be granted only if the court accepts their argument that the Commission usurped the jurisdiction of a Grand Jury, but that is impossible since there is nothing in the legislation creating the Commission which even hints of an intent to vest it with authority to indict, and the report being prepared by the Commission does not come within the purview of CPL 190.85.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a proceeding seeking a judgment declaring that the legislation creating the State Commission of Investigation (McKinney's Uncons Laws of NY &sect;&sect; 7501-7507) is unconstitutional and that the Commission violated the due process rights of petitioners, a District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney, petitioners' requests are denied; not only is there a strong&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  presumption of constitutionality which accompanies every duly enacted law, but the constitutionality of the legislation in question has been specifically upheld by the Court of Appeals.  The procedures governing the Commission have also passed constitutional muster, and petitioners' claim that the Commission unconstitutionally usurped the role of the Grand Jury has also been rejected, inasmuch as the Commission's function is investigatory not accusative.  Moreover, petitioners' assertion that the Commission relied upon the testimony of admitted perjurors is immaterial, since when and if the time comes to prosecute, the Grand Jury considering the case(s) will be told they may indict only on the basis of competent legal evidence.</SPAN></P>

In a proceeding brought by a District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney seeking judgments declaring that the State Commission of Investigation exceeded its statutory authority by, e.g., unlawfully intervening in the appointment of a Special District Attorney, petitioners' requests must be denied pending a hearing since many of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  allegations made against the Commission have been contraverted; whether the Commission's conduct complied with the law and, if not, what affects its failure to do so would have, should only be decided after a full hearing on the issue.</SPAN></P>

In a proceeding brought by a District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney seeking a judgment declaring that the State Commission of Investigation exceeded its authority by violating Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 in that it allowed its proceedings to be televised, although the Commission conceded that the proceedings in question were in fact televised, declaratory judgment is inappropriate since any violation of section 52 is a misdemeanor and the court may not act as prosecutor and jury.</SPAN></P>

The appointment was made by a Judge, who also appointed the replacement prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory Judgments -- When Remedy Appropriate -- State Commission of Investigation -- Charges of Professional Misconduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. In a proceeding brought by a District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney seeking a judgment that the State Commission of Investigation exceeded its authority when some of its members engaged in acts proscribed by the Code of Professional Responsibility, a declaratory judgment is inappropriate since any charges of professional misconduct must first be referred to the appropriate Appellate Division and/or Grievance Committee.  It is noted that members of the Commission who are lawyers are not &quot;granted immunity&quot; from their code of conduct when they act as commissioners.  </SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the separation of powers doctrine did not require judicial deference to a patently unconstitutional and obviously unauthorized use of legislative appropriations. Further, the court held that courts did not assume that the legislature authorized its members to act in patent violation of its constitutional powers. The court sustained the indictment, concluding that it was a patent violation of the state constitution to pay legislative salaries for work which was of no value to any purpose but the election of a political candidate and to persons who never performed any service of value to the legislature or to any legislator in an official capacity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, the Minority Leader of the New York State Senate, his chief of staff and three State Senators, may lawfully be prosecuted for offering a false instrument for filing (Penal Law &sect; 175.35) and grand larceny (Penal Law &sect; 155.40) for hiring onto the Senate payroll legislative employees to work full time on election campaigns on behalf of Democratic candidates for the State Senate in 1986 and then certifying on the biweekly payroll certification forms that such employees were performing &quot;the proper duties of the position&quot; of Senate legislative staff. Prosecution of defendants does not violate the separation of powers among the coordinate branches of the State government since the Speech or Debate Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art III, &sect; 11), which provides that members of the Legislature &quot;shall not be questioned&quot; for &quot;any speech or debate in either house&quot;, only confers immunity from prosecution on legislators and their staffs for legislative acts essential to the legislative process and defendants actions in employing persons exclusively &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to perform political campaign functions which have no relation to the deliberative and communicative legislative process are not deserving of speech or debate protection.  However, defendants may not be prosecuted for acts relating to the employment of three staff members who did not exclusively perform campaign work while on the legislative payroll since, once evidence appears that the activity under investigation is arguably within a proper legislative sphere, the prosecutor must establish that the prosecution will not encompass privileged legislative acts and the prosecutor herein has not met such burden as to those legislative employees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The separation of powers doctrine </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art III, &sect; 11), which ordinarily protects legislative matters involving &quot;political questions&quot;, such as the functions and duties of legislative staff, from judicial or executive interference, does not require judicial deference to a patently unconstitutional and unauthorized use of legislative appropriations and, thus, does not preclude the prosecution of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendants, the Minority Leader of the New York State Senate, his chief of staff and three State Senators on charges of offering a false instrument for filing (Penal Law &sect; 175.35) and grand larceny (Penal Law &sect; 155.40) for hiring onto the Senate payroll legislative employees to work full time on the election campaigns on behalf of Democratic candidates for the State Senate in 1986 and then certifying on the biweekly payroll certification forms that such employees were performing &quot;the proper duties of the position&quot; of Senate staff. Defendants' expenditure of the funds appropriated for salaries of Senate staff to pay salaries of persons engaged full time in political campaigning was not a legislative function deserving constitutional protection from judicial interference, but was an unconstitutional private application of public revenue (NY Const, art VII, &sect; 8).  The constitutional prohibition against the use of State funds for private purposes, as construed by the courts, provides an appropriate source of standards by which limitations on the legislative function may be judicially determined.  However, defendants may only be prosecuted with respect to the activities of staff hired solely &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to work on the 1986 election since prosecution of defendants with respect to the activities of legislative employees who were employed prior to or subsequent to the 1986 election raises nonjusticiable questions regarding the internal administration of the Legislature's staff, which is an area peculiarly within the prerogative of the Legislature protected by the Constitution from executive or judicial interference.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State of New York sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3001 seeking a declaration of the invalidity and unenforceability of a local law of defendant Suffolk County, declaring that the use, sale or possession of &quot;steel jaw leghold traps&quot; to be unlawful within the County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">County of Suffolk, N.Y. Local Law No. 37 was an ordinance that declared the use, sale, or manufacture of leghold animal traps to be unlawful within the county. The authority to enact local laws was derived from the state constitution. The power granted to the county legislature was limited to that which was granted by the State. The power permitted the county to enact laws for the protection, safety, and well-being of persons and property within the county. However, the court found two reasons why the local law had to fall. First, under N.Y. Envt'l. Conserv. Law &sect; 11-0111, county legislative bodies were not permitted to exercise powers concerning the protection or preservation of game or wildlife. Second, the State had preempted the field and had included certain leghold traps to be legal. The county could not override the general law, regardless of its motive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the county law was invalid and enjoined its enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Game -- Steel Jaw Leghold Traps -- State Preemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A county law which declares the use, sale or possession of steel jaw leghold traps to be unlawful within the county is invalid since the county law clearly regulates the preservation and protection of wildlife, which is expressly prohibited by ECL 11-0111 and is, therefore, violative of NY Constitution, article IX, &sect; 2 (c) (ii); regardless of the laudable motive stated by the county in enacting the law in question, i.e., to protect persons within the county from the traps and their inherent dangers, one of the purposes of the law is to promote the more humane catching of animals and pursuant to hoary principles of statutory construction, the fact that the State has included certain traps of the sort in question and has excluded others </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ECL 11-1101 [5], [6] [a]) makes it clear that &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Legislature intended to occupy the field and prevent local legislative bodies from passing conflicting enactments.  Moreover, inasmuch as no facts are in dispute and a simple reading of the applicable laws and constitutional provisions is all that is required to determine the validity of the county law, summary judgment is an appropriate device to resolve the action in the interest of court economy.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landlords brought a motion for summary judgment or dismissal in an action against it by plaintiff City of New York for alleged violations of the City of New York's Unlawful Eviction Law (UEL), New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 26-521 to 26-529, asserting res judicata and preemption of the UEL by the state Omnibus Housing Act, 1983 N.Y. Laws 403.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City of New York brought an action against defendant landlords for various acts of interference with and harassment of tenants and withholding of service on the part of defendants in order to induce tenants to vacate, in violation of the City of New York's Unlawful Eviction Law (UEL), New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 26-521 to 26-529. In similar complaints, tenants and defendants had settled, with defendants agreeing to make repairs and improvements in service and to pay tenants' legal fees. The complaints were dismissed with prejudice, and the parties agreed to use their best efforts to have the instant case dismissed with prejudice. The parties were ordered to comply with the terms of the stipulation of settlement. Defendants filed a motion for dismissal or summary judgment alleging that the matter was res judicata because of the order and that the UEL had been preempted by the Omnibus Housing Act (OHA), 1983 N.Y. Laws 403. The court denied the motion, concluding that plaintiff had no privity in the prior proceeding, so res judicata did not apply and that the evidence did not show that the OHA was intended to preempt the field of unlawful evictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landlords' motion for summary judgment or dismissal was denied because defendants did not meet their burden of proving preemption and the invalidity of New York City's Unlawful Eviction Law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Wrongful Eviction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The settlement of a proceeding brought by the tenants in defendants' buildings before the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) does not bar the City of New York, on grounds of res judicata, from bringing an action against defendants under the city's Unlawful Eviction Law (UEL) (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 26-521 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> based upon the same alleged acts of harassment of tenants and withholding of services in order to induce tenants to vacate their dwelling units since the city was not in privity with any party or otherwise in control of any party in the proceeding before the DHCR and, thus, cannot be bound by the settlement and the order of DHCR dismissing the proceeding with prejudice.  The action by the city under the UEL is not preempted by the Omnibus Housing Act (L 1983, ch 403, &sect; 1) which makes a finding that the public interest would be better served if the systems of regulation of rents and evictions were placed under a single State agency, since the State has not clearly evinced a desire to preempt the entire field &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of unlawful evictions. Accordingly, the UEL continues as a tool in the hands of the Corporation Counsel to meet the city's special housing problems even after the assumption by the State of the administration of rent regulation. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20 to have the sentencing provisions of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.00 declared unconstitutional as applied to him as a violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. After he was convicted by a jury of robbery and attempted robbery, the court imposed the minimum sentence of an indeterminate term of two to six years and granted his motion for a stay of execution of the sentence pending his appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed on appeal. The People took no position with respect to his motion to have the sentence set aside except to request certain conditions on a sentence of probation if the court granted the motion. The court granted the motion. Although the legislature had the power to determine sentences, the judicial branch had the power to determine whether the legislature had contravened a constitutional prohibition and the court held that it was not precluded from finding mandatory imprisonment cruel and unusual in defendant's case. It found that the punitive aspect of incarceration was not compelling because the loss to the complainants was minimal and no one was harmed. After his conviction, defendant graduated from high school and when he filed his motion, he was completing his sophomore year of college in religious studies and business administration. The court determined that the likelihood that he posed no further threat to the public was strong and that, in his case, the purposes of punishment were not best served by incarceration. Therefore, to apply a statutorily mandated term of imprisonment would have constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's motion to have his mandatory sentence of incarceration for robbery and attempted robbery declared unconstitutional as applied to him and directed him to present himself for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The imposition of a statutorily mandated term of imprisonment on defendant upon his conviction for first degree robbery for the robbery of a jacket and a small amount of currency would constitute cruel and unusual punishment since the sentencing statute's purposes of deterrence, isolation, retribution and rehabilitation will not best be served by incarceration in view of the evidence that defendant is well on the road to rehabilitation and will complete his education in religious studies and business administration. The punitive aspect of incarceration is not as compelling as in a case where injury was inflicted or the loss was great nor is the likelihood that defendant poses a further threat to the public very strong.  Mandatory incarceration will not deter further criminal behavior because defendant has resolved to conduct himself within societal norms.  Isolation will not serve to protect the public because defendant has taken control of his life and has struggled to conform and has successfully improved his stature in the community.  The threat of incarceration for defendant during the pendency of the case has adequately served the ends of retribution. </SPAN></P>

A landlord who failed to give a tenant notice of his intention not to offer a renewal lease between 120 and 150 days prior to the end of the lease term (Rent Stabilization Code [9 NYCRR] &sect; 2523.5 [a]) is not entitled to a declaration of nonprimary residence and is required to offer a renewal lease, since in order to refuse to renew a lease on the grounds of nonprimary residence, a landlord must follow the statutorily mandated procedural requirements for obtaining a determination of the tenant's status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Lease -- Renewal Lease -- Hospital as Named Tenant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Pursuant to chapter 940 of the Laws of 1984, which amended the Administrative Code of the City New York and the Emergency Tenant Protection Act to make specific provision for not-for-profit hospitals subletting residential apartments, it is such a hospital which is entitled to renewal leases for those apartments since it is the named tenant on the expired renewal leases; the renewal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  leases should run prospectively from the date executed leases are delivered to the tenant. The landlord's argument that the subtenant nurses, and not the hospital which employs them, are the intended beneficiaries of chapter 940 and are entitled to the renewal leases is belied by the legislative history and statutory language of the law, since it is clear that the not-for-profit hospital is the tenant sought to be protected by the corrective legislation; in addition, subtenants have no right to renew under the Rent Stabilization Law (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 26-511 [c] [12] [g]).  Moreover, the landlord's assertion that chapter 940 is an unconstitutional discriminatory treatment and a taking without due process may not be considered because the Attorney-General has not been notified that the constitutionality of the statute was in issue </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPLR 1012 [b]; Executive Law &sect; 71), and, in any event, that assertion is meritless.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant who was an artist, filed a motion to dismiss his charge of displaying his paintings for the purpose of sale, in violation of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 20-453. He alleged that the requirement that he first obtain a vendor's license from the Department of Consumer Affairs was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was an artist, argued that the municipal statute, in requiring artists to obtain a license while exempting the vendors of written material from the licensing requirement, discriminated unreasonably against artwork. Since the artist's claim related to an alleged failure of equal protection of the laws, the court took an equal protection approach. There was no allegation that the statute operated on anything but a first-come, first-serve basis, that it was content-neutral and closed off no other means of dissemination. The vending of artwork, therefore, received all the First Amendment protection to which it is entitled. Although political artwork must be licensed and nonpolitical written matter need not be, the court still did not find that the presumption of constitutionality had been overcome. Therefore, the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion was denied, but in light of the hardship he would suffer on conviction of the offense, the confiscation of his artwork and the tools of his trade, the court considered his motion to be one for dismissal in the interest of justice, which the court granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of New York City's street vendor licensing statute to include pictorial artwork in the exemption from the licensing requirement accorded vendors of written material (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 20-453) does not constitute a denial of equal protection even though pictorial artwork, as a form of self-expression, is covered by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech, since not all legitimate forms of self-expression deserve the same administrative treatment.  Since the licensing statute promotes a compelling purpose, the regulation of pedestrian traffic, operates on a first-come, first-serve basis, is content-neutral and closes off no other means of dissemination, the vending of artwork is receiving all the First Amendment protection to which it is entitled.  Accordingly, defendant has failed to overcome his burden of showing that the coverage of the licensing exemption should be enlarged to include the sidewalk sales of his artwork but, in light of the hardship defendant will suffer on conviction of vending his paintings without having first obtained a vendor's license &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  from the Department of Consumer Affairs (confiscation of his artwork and the tools of his trade), the complaint is dismissed in the interest of justice ( CPL 170.40).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the superintendent of New York's department of insurance, adopted amendments to 11 N.Y. C.R.R. part 52. This amendment related to prohibitions against requiring or considering body fluid tests for evidence of Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) in the application for, or the risk management determinations of, insurability for individual and small group insurance. In issuing the regulation, respondent largely relied upon the certification of the state's health commissioner. Petitioners challenged such regulatory amendments and argued their invalidity on several grounds. The court ruled that the regulation was null and void by holding that a certain section of the state's insurance law provided no basis for the regulation, since it was arbitrary and capricious by respondent to deem HIV-positive high risk individuals to be part of the standard classifications used for ascertaining insurability. The court also concluded that the regulation itself was arbitrary and capricious and lacking a rational or factual basis as the reasons cited in the relied-upon certification were based upon social conjecture rather than objective fact or were speculative in nature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation of the Department of Insurance prohibiting insurers from requiring or considering body fluid tests for evidence of the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) in the application for or the risk management determinations of insurability for individual and small group health insurance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 11 NYCRR part 52) is null and void as lacking a rational or factual basis since testing for HIV sero-positivity (HIV causes AIDS and AIDS Related Complex) produces a statistically valid basis for actuarial risk classification purposes as an accurate, significant and substantial predictor of morbidity, mortality and future medical expenses.  Petitioners have established a firm foundation of minimum accepted facts and statistics in order to establish reasoned conclusions on the fiscal implications of the HIV epidemic on individual and small group health insurance policies and respondent has provided no valid basis for concluding that petitioners' position on the fiscal impact of inclusion of an uninsurable risk classification into &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the standard insurable risk classifications is speculative. The prohibition against any unfair discrimination between individuals of the same class (Insurance Law &sect; 4224) does not justify the regulation since the class of individuals consisting of sero-positive individuals is distinctly and substantially different in terms of morbidity, mortality and health expense risk from that of those who do not test positive and it is arbitrary and capricious to deem HIV-positive, high-risk individuals to be part of the standard classifications. The effect of the regulation is discriminatory since it affords the person infected with HIV a preferred economic status over persons infected with other health-threatening diseases or life-styles and requires the low-risk, uninfected policyholder to subsidize the policyholder infected with HIV.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, three licensed parking garages, commenced an action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 against respondents, Department of Consumer Affairs of New York City and its commissioner, alleging that respondents' determination that the garages had violated New York City, N.Y., Department of Consumer Affairs Gen. Reg. 15(2) by refusing to allow the respondents' agents to inspect their premises was unreasonable, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the case of each garage, when the respondents' agents came to the premises, they were shown the public parts of the garage. They were then asked to wait for a supervisor before viewing the non-public parts of the garages. After waiting for various periods of time, the agents left without viewing the non-public areas. At a hearing for the violations of Reg. 15(2), the hearing officer determined that the requests to wait vitiated the purpose of the inspection, permitted possible corrections, and interfered with the agents' performance of duties. On their complaint, the garages contended Reg. 15(2) was unconstitutional because it permitted a warrantless search. The court reviewed the statutes and regulations regarding the parking industry in New York City and held that Reg. 15(2) implemented the requirements imposed on respondents by New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 20-104(b)(5), 20-114(a), 20-327(a), (b). The garages were part of a pervasively regulated industry, the inspections furthered the respondents' regulatory scheme, the respondents' ability to conduct the inspections was essential to its administrative scheme, and the inspections permitted were limited in scope.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the city code providing for warrantless inspections by respondents' agents of the garages' premises was constitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Improper Form of Action -- Conversion to Proper Form</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An article 78 proceeding is not the proper way to test the constitutionality of a regulation which permits warrantless searches of parking garages; rather, such proceeding is the proper vehicle to determine if a regulation or ordinance has been applied in an unconstitutional manner.  However, where all proper parties are before the court, the court may treat the matter as an action for declaratory judgment and decide if the legislative enactment is constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Warrantless Inspections of Parking Garages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A regulation of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which authorizes the warrantless inspection of parking garages, is constitutional, since the parking garage industry is pervasively regulated, the inspections are limited to once per each two-year period, their scope &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is restricted to all records or documents required to be maintained by the licensee, nonpublic areas of a garage are inspected to determine compliance with city codes, and the inspections are conducted during regular business hours. The long history of the city's regulation of the industry clearly demonstrates the existence of an &quot;administrative scheme&quot; to achieve regulation of parking lots and garages, and such regulations were promulgated to aid in the enforcement of specific legislative enactments regarding the maximum capacity of parking lots and garages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Judicial Review -- Substantial Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding to review a determination of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, a review of the facts adduced during the administrative hearing at which both parties had full opportunity to present their respective positions supports the findings made by the Administrative Hearing Officer; consequently, since the decision by the Hearing Officer was not arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, an abuse of discretion, or effected by errors of law, and was supported by substantial evidence, the petition is denied and the proceeding dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlord sought review of a ruling of the Department of Housing and Community Renewal (New York), that declined to stay the effect of respondent agency's order that decreased the amount of legal regulated rent for landlord's premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the landlord's application was encompassed by N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 63 rather than, as the landlord asserted, N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78. If an injunction were issued, the payment of a higher rent by the tenants pending determination of the petition for administrative review would be just as burdensome as the landlord's collection of a lower rent if no injunction issued. The court concluded that the landlord did not demonstrate any exigent circumstances that removed the matter from the general rule of administrative finality in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7801. Furthermore, the order to show cause directed that service be made upon the affected tenants; however, the landlord neglected to file an affidavit of service, and it was not certain that the tenants were parties to the proceeding. Moreover the agency was empowered to grant the requested stay upon such notice to the affected parties and reasonable opportunity to be heard, as it deemed appropriate. Therefore, there was no necessity for judicial intervention to effect a stay under the terms proposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the landlord's request for an injunction that stayed enforcement of the agency's order that decreased the amount of legal regulated rent for the landlord's premises.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A petition seeking to enjoin the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal from enforcing an order decreasing the amount of legal regulated rent petitioner could collect is dismissed; the pendency of an application before an administrative agency is not an &quot;action&quot; within the contemplation of CPLR article 63 and mandamus to review ( CPLR art 78) will not lie inasmuch as there has been no final agency determination.  Although a party may seek review of an order of the type complained of if 90 days have passed following submission of a request for an agency review, the instant proceeding was brought prior to the expiration of such time period.  Moreover, petitioner is unable to establish that the injury it might sustain if the injunctive relief is not granted is more burdensome than the harm which its tenants might sustain if the relief were granted, since, if successful, petitioner can be fully recompensed by monetary damages; nor has petitioner demonstrated the likelihood that it will ultimately prevail on the merits in light of the factual nature of the dispute concerning whether petitioner &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  decreased services to its tenants. Petitioner has demonstrated no basis to remove the proceeding from the rule of administrative finality, and given the power of the agency to stay its own rulings, petitioner should look to that body for the relief it seeks.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A Village Court has jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of a local ordinance regulating the towing industry where defendants' challenges to the ordinance were made in the context of a criminal proceeding and as a defense to informations charging them with unlicensed towing, with the court treating the challenges as motions to dismiss on constitutional grounds; indeed, CPL 170.35 (1) (c) expressly confers jurisdiction to determine whether the law defining the offense charged in an information is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, and CPL 170.30 (1) (a) expressly provides that a local criminal court may, upon defendant's motion, dismiss an information upon the ground that it is defective within the meaning of CPL 170.35.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Inasmuch as it is elementary that constitutional issues should not be decided on the basis of an inadequate factual record, it would be inappropriate and premature to determine the constitutionality, as applied, of a local ordinance regulating the towing industry in the absence of a more complete &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  record after a plenary trial where the factual contentions of the parties may be fully heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Towing Industry -- Constitutionality of Ordinance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A local ordinance regulating the towing industry is not facially invalid where defendants have failed to meet their burden of establishing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt in their criminal prosecution arising out of their towing motor vehicles without a license, since the ordinance represents a reasonable and valid exercise of legislative police power. The ordinance clearly represents a considered effort by the local legislature to enact procedures intended to safeguard the public from fraud, exorbitant rates, and other tow car abuses, as well as to assure, within reason, that disabled vehicles are promptly removed from highways so as not to impede the free flow of traffic through the municipality; as such, the legislation bears a rational relationship to valid legislative findings and is not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable in the means which the municipality has adopted to effectuate the purposes sought to be attained by its enactment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A local ordinance regulating the towing industry and requiring licenses of tow car owners and drivers is not an unconstitutional impingement on interstate commerce, notwithstanding the fact that the ordinance is enforced on an interstate highway, since the court is unaware of any Federal enactment which so occupies the towing business in interstate highways as to exclude the right of the municipality to enact licensing requirements and appropriate regulations in the public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Towing Industry -- Tower's Response to Motorist's Call</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A local ordinance regulating the towing industry is not unconstitutionally overbroad owing to the fact that it purports to regulate a business which does not solicit within the boundaries of the locality, and the reliance by defendants, who are being criminally prosecuted for towing without a license, on the fact that they were merely responding to a motorist's call is misplaced, since they are not charged with violating the antisoliciting provision of the ordinance; moreover, defendants overlook that portion of the ordinance which permits the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  towing of a vehicle involved in an accident or becomes disabled so long as a signed authorization is obtained from the motorist, irrespective of whether the motorist called the tow car owner or vice versa, it being sufficient that a tow owner may lawfully tow a disabled vehicle so long as a written authorization has been obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Towing Industry -- Effect on Right to Contract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A local ordinance regulating the towing industry does not unconstitutionally impinge upon the right of tow car owners to contract where it does not appear that defendants, who are being criminally prosecuted for towing without a license, are the persons who actually contract with the motorists since they claim to be merely tow car drivers, not owners; moreover, the right to contract is not absolute and where a legislative finding of a substantive evil threatening the safety and welfare of the public is predicated on a rational basis and is reasonably appropriated to curb that evil, the rights of individuals to contract must give way to the State's right to superimpose its police powers in the public interest. It is noteworthy that defendants concede that it is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a legitimate concern of the locality to require licensing of tow car owners and operators to prevent fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Regulation of Towing Industry -- Duplicate Licensing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a criminal prosecution for operating a tow car without a license in violation of a local ordinance regulating the towing industry, defendants' contention that the ordinance in question duplicates other similar local ordinances which also require licensing, thereby requiring defendants to obtain duplicatory licenses from every locality in which they operate, is not an argument of constitutional dimension and is better addressed to the elected officials of those municipalities which have enacted tow car laws.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father brought suit against the mother to obtain custody of the parties' minor child. The mother sought an order allowing her husband, the stepfather, to represent her in the action. The court denied that motion and the stepfather then sought to intervene in the action. He claimed that the court's determination might affect the life-style and manner in which he and the mother raise the child and could have a financial impact upon him as he provided support for the child over and above that provided by the father. He further claimed that he would be slandered and his religious beliefs put on trial and that he should be permitted to intervene so that he could cross-examine witnesses who testify against him. The court denied his motion to intervene, finding that he did not assert a legal interest which formed a basis for intervention. The stepfather's asserted rights were identical to those of respondent. Further, he would not be bound by entry of the judgment in the proceedings and, if custody was awarded to the father, such determination would not affect the stepfather's legal rights or cause any obligation to be imposed upon him.</SPAN></P>

Further, the proposed intervenor will not be bound by entry of judgment in this proceeding as the judgment will in no manner affect his legal rights or impose any legal duty or obligation upon him.  Moreover, insofar as the stepfather seeks to intervene in order to represent his wife's interest before the court, a grant of permission to intervene would violate CPLR 321, which authorizes a person to appear only in person or by duly licensed attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for dismissal of indictment by reason of the unconstitutionality of N.Y. Crim. Proc.

Due process was not violated by a failure to present such evidence to grand jury. The court also denied defendant's motion to preclude the use of defendant's statements at trial because the district attorney had served timely notice on defendant of an intent to use the wiretap evidence.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- Right to Appear before Grand Jury -- Demand that Defendant's Witnesses Waive Immunity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The discretionary power of the District Attorney to demand that defendant's witnesses waive their immunity before giving evidence to the Grand Jury ( CPL 190.50 [4]) does not violate due process by impairing or interfering with the investigatory power of the Grand Jury since the standard of fundamental fairness, requiring that the Grand Jury be &quot;well informed concerning the circumstances of the case before it&quot; and that the prosecutor meet an obligation of &quot;fair dealing to the accused and candor to the courts&quot; to see that &quot;justice is done&quot;, is not violated by a failure to present potentially &quot;mitigating&quot; or &quot;exculpatory&quot; evidence at the Grand Jury stage.  CPL 190.50 (4) tends to further the Grand Jury's investigatory/accusatory function by protecting against the unwise, unwarranted and uninformed conferring of immunity by the Grand Jury on suspect persons.  Since a Grand Jury proceeding is in no sense adversarial, the fact that a reasonable and salutary limitation is placed on a defendant's access to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Grand Jury does not violate the concept of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disclosure -- Notice of Intention to Offer Evidence</SPAN></P>

CPL 710.30 (2), which precludes the People from using the statements of the defendant at trial unless notice of such intention is served upon the defendant within 15 days &quot;after arraignment and before trial&quot;, does not require that such notice be served within 15 days after the defendant's initial arraignment on the felony complaint, but rather the &quot;arraignment&quot; contemplated by the statute is the arraignment on the triable accusatory instrument, i.e., the indictment. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The first three counts of the indictment charging defendant with the use of a child in a sexual performance (Penal Law &sect; 263.05) and endangering the welfare of a child based upon defendant's possession of nude photographs of a seven-year-old boy must be severed from the other charges against defendant of sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of two other children in view of the substantial difference in the type and quality of the evidence ( CPL 200.20 [3]).  The first three counts will be established by pictures of a nude male whereas the remaining counts will depend on the testimony of the children and defendant has indicated a need to testify as to those counts.  Under these circumstances, there is a substantial likelihood that the jury would be unable to consider separately the proof as it relates to each offense.  The People need not specify the number of times defendant allegedly touched the penis of one of the victims since the allegation in the indictment that defendant touched the victim on numerous occasions throughout a specified &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  period of time is sufficient and any additional information is evidentiary in nature and not the proper subject matter of a bill of particulars.  In addition, the request for particulars concerning the &quot;exact location&quot; in which the crimes charged in counts 4-9 occurred is satisfied by the allegation that the acts occurred while defendant was employed as a school bus driver and took place while on school premises or on route to and from the elementary school.</SPAN></P>

Child pornography is not entitled to First Amendment protection even where the material is not obscene under constitutional standards and States have greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depicting of children.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The maternal grandparents argued that if the father had AIDS his life expectancy would be minimal, which was a consideration in awarding custody, and that the court would want to consider whether the father was facing a death-threatening illness and was suicidal or homicidal. The father refused to voluntarily submit to a blood test. The court denied the maternal grandparents' motion. The court concluded that no compelling interest had been shown for involuntary testing. There was no claim, nor could there be on the available medical evidence, that the children would be in danger from living with the father if he were seropositive. A court-appointed expert psychiatrist testified that (1) even if the father were suffering from AIDS and had a shortened life span, it would not justify removing the children from their long-term custodial parent, (2) assuming that the father actually suffered from AIDS, his knowledge of the disease would create no danger to him or to the children, and (3) he saw no evidence of any suicidal ideation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that defendant had discriminated in the use of peremptory challenges based upon race. The jury was then discharged, because of the length of time in conducting proceeding, and because several jurors had already been discharged and returned to the jury pool. At the time of the discharge of the jurors, there were seven blacks and three whites on the panel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered the credibility of two white police officers who stated they saw defendant in possession of guns. Defendant and civilian witness claimed that the guns were not in defendant's possession. At issue was whether defendant, as a minority, could use peremptory challenges to discriminate against majority jurors and whether Batson applied. Other issues before the court were whether the government was entitled to a trial by jury composed of fair cross-section of community, whether defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges constituted &quot;state action, whether white potential jurors constituted &quot;cognizable&quot; groups, and whether the state had standing to object to discrimination against juror. Court found those cases adopting &quot;possibility&quot; of obtaining fair cross-section of community rule in U.S. Const. amend. VI were compelling and would ultimately be adopted. The court ruled that Batson applied. The underlying premise of Batson was prosecutorial racially motivated use of peremptory challenges violated Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that there was sufficient state action for standing and that the New York constitution was violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Batson case applied to defendant's peremptory challenges and defendant was held to have utilized his peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory method in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the New York constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A minority defendant's racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges to systematically exclude white jurors violates both the State and Federal constitutional right to a jury trial, which includes a right to a &quot;possibility&quot; of obtaining a fair cross section of the community at the petit jury level.  Racially motivated use of peremptory challenges is violative of equal protection since &quot;State action&quot; is involved in the discrimination in that the State supplies the tools (peremptory challenges), the place (court-room), the object (juror), the setting (criminal action) and enforces the discrimination (discharge of juror).  The District Attorney, as representative of the State and as an agent for the excluded juror, has standing to contest defendant's discriminatory use of peremptory challenges as an injury to the community, to the jury system and to the law as an institution.  Alternatively, the State has standing to assert the equal protection claims of the excluded jurors under the doctrine of third-party standing.  In addition, since a citizen has a &quot;civil right&quot; to serve&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on a petit jury </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Civil Rights Law &sect; 13; Judiciary Law &sect; 500), defendant's use of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner violates the constitutional provision that no person &quot;be subjected to any discrimination in his civil rights * * * because of race&quot; (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant justices moved to dismiss plaintiff district attorney's request for a declaration that the federal and state constitutions prohibited defense counsel from exercising race-based peremptory challenges, that the justices could not grant peremptory challenges without making further inquiry when it was shown, prima facie, that defense counsel's peremptories were race-based, and that N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The justices claimed that the district attorney lacked standing to bring the action in her own right or as a representative of prospective excluded jurors and that, if she had standing, the conduct complained of was not state action. The court granted the motion to dismiss. The court held that the district attorney did not have standing as a representative of excluded potential jurors because such jurors had standing to seek declaratory relief on their own behalf. The court held that the district attorney had standing to bring the action in her own right because standing should only be denied where there was clear legislative intent negating review or lack of injury in fact. The court held that the Fourteenth Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 both required state action. Peremptory challenges by defense counsel under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 270.25(1) did not involve state action because the state could not require or compel defense counsel to exercise peremptory challenges, much less require them to exercise their peremptory challenges in a racially motivated manner.

The court held that the legislature was aware of the common usage of the term &quot;tungsten-carbide&quot; when it enacted the revival statute. The court held that purpose of the statute regarding the tungsten-carbide workers was to revive their claims and that the statute had to be interpreted to advance the remedy sought to be provided. The statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because there was a legitimate state interest in the health, safety, and welfare of society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revival of actions provision of the 1986 toxic torts legislation (L 1986, ch 682) revives plaintiff's previously time-barred actions against defendants, manufacturers and suppliers of cobalt and cobalt-containing materials utilized during the cemented tungsten-carbide manufacturing process, for injury caused by plaintiff's exposure to cobalt while employed in the tungsten-carbide industry resulting in his developing cobalt-related lung disease (hard metals disease), notwithstanding the fact that the statute only revives actions for injuries &quot;caused by the latent effects of exposure to * * * tungsten-carbide&quot;, a compound of elements which contains no cobalt, since &quot;tungsten-carbide&quot; as used in the statute was intended as a broad, all-inclusive synonym for the hard metals manufacturing process. The Legislature was aware that the finished hard metal product manufactured at the plant where plaintiff was employed is commonly referred to as &quot;tungsten-carbide&quot; and that the manufacturing process is commonly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  known as the tungsten-carbide manufacturing process. The clear purpose of the revival statute vis-a-vis the tungsten-carbide workers was to revive their claims and the statute must be read to advance the remedy sought to be provided.  The 1984 dismissal of plaintiff's actions on Statute of Limitations grounds, even though final and on the merits, is not an adjudication of rights that bars plaintiff from prosecuting the current actions pursuant to a right newly conferred by statute.  In addition, the revival statute does not violate the dictates of due process since the State has a legitimate interest in preferring plaintiff's privilege to litigate over defendants' protection from stale claims.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State of New York charged defendant with arson in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 150.15 and reckless endangerment in the first degree under N.Y. Penal Law. &sect; 120.25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with arson and reckless endangerment after he allegedly set a fire in an apartment in which he resided with his ex-wife. The court sought to determine whether defendant's severe intoxication negated the intent element required to substantiate the crime of arson in the second degree, and if not, whether he could still could be liable for the lesser included offense. The court found that defendant set the fires following an argument with his ex-wife. Defendant contended that he was incapable of formulating the requisite intent necessary for arson. The court held that voluntary intoxication was not a defense to criminal charges, but it could be offered to negative an element of the crime. While intoxication could negative the mens rea in a crime regarding specific intent, it could not negative the lower culpable mental state required in crimes of recklessness. The court determined that mens rea for arson in the second degree was negated by the intoxication; however, arson in the fourth degree, as well as reckless endangerment, only required a reckless mental state. Therefore, defendant was found guilty of arson in the fourth degree and reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found not guilty of arson in the second degree because he lacked the specific intent to damage a building.

Defendant voluntarily commenced a reckless course of action, the natural causes of which were intended.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intoxication will negative the specific intent required in some crimes (Penal Law &sect; 15.25), but will not act as even a partial defense in general intent crimes such as those requiring a mental state of recklessness (Penal Law &sect; 15.05 [3]).  Moreover, even though the law may evolve as new medical research on the nature of alcoholism becomes available, alcoholism is not, according to the prevailing view, accepted as a defense to any crime.  Accordingly, defendant, a chronic alcoholic who set fire to the apartment in which he resided with his ex-wife and children while he was intoxicated, is not guilty of arson in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 150.15) since he lacked the specific intent to damage a building, but defendant is guilty of the lesser included offense of arson in the fourth degree, which is defined as &quot;recklessly [damaging] a building * * * by intentionally starting a fire&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 150.05 [1]), and also of reckless endangerment in the first degree (Penal Law &sect; 120.25) since his act of voluntarily imbibing the first alcoholic beverage that led to criminal conduct constituted recklessness per se.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was the mother of a child who was injured and suffered the loss of personal property in a fight with defendant's child. Plaintiff brought suit against defendant seeking damages pursuant to the New York Parental Liability Act, N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 3-112. The court noted that &sect; 3-112 fixed an unconditional monetary liability on all nongovernment parents or guardians, natural or legal, for the malicious and destructive acts of their children, between the ages of 10 and 18, who were in their custody and unemancipated at the time of the damage. Liability was limited to $ 2,500. The court found that &sect; 3-112 violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because it was, in substantial intent, and in practical effect, a bill of attainder.

If the Legislature had stipulated any other predicate for liability other than the relationship of a parent and child set forth in the statute, such as lack of supervision or negligence or willful behavior of any sort, the constitutional issue of a bill of attainder would not be present.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed state and federal actions to challenge the constitutionality of the act, which would allow defendants to acquire the investor-owned utility company's stock or assets. The court denied plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunctive relief as premature because defendants had not yet implemented a tender offer. Thus, there was no present danger of irreparable harm to justify the preliminary injunction. The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss because the act did not violate either N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6 or 11, or the corresponding due process and equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution. The court adopted the reasoning used by the federal district court to conclude that the act was constitutional because the state and federal provisions were substantially similar. The act did not violate substantive due process because it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. The act did violate the equal protection clause because it was social and economic legislation that neither classified on the basis of a suspect class nor impaired a fundamental right, and was rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

State courts are not bound by Federal decisions in cases in which a statute is tested against the provisions of the Federal Constitution.  In view of LILCO's previous successful contention in a State court action that the State, in enacting the LIPA Act, has preempted the subject area of legislation, the doctrine of judicial estoppel might be utilized to dismiss the complaint since, having once invoked the LIPA Act for its own benefit, LILCO may not now attack its constitutionality; however, since plaintiff shareholder was not a party in the previous State court action, the court will determine the matter upon its merits rather than invoke the estoppel doctrine against LILCO alone.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the media's application to photograph the trial constituted the unauthorized practice of law, that the enabling act of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 218 violated separation of powers, and that enabling act and regulations passed pursuant to it violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court denied defendant's motion and granted that of the media, concluding that the media was not practicing law by filing a request to engage in audio-visual coverage regarding events in court. Rather, the media practiced its trade of delivering news to the public. As to the constitutional claims, &sect; 218 did not violate separation of power because it was permissive in nature.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Real Property Transfer Gains Tax (Tax Law art 31-B) applies to the sale of stock of a corporation that owns an interest in a partnership which owns real property. The acquisition of a controlling interest in any entity with an interest in real property is, by statute, a transaction subject to the gains tax, and a tiered entity transfer is a transaction subject to tax (20 NYCRR 590.51).  Nor is the transaction exempt by reason of the &quot;grandfather&quot; clause contained in section 1443 (6) of the Tax Law. The interpretation of the Tax Commission that there was no &quot;written contract&quot; executed before the effective date of article 31-B, and that the resolutions of petitioners' boards of directors authorizing the sale of stock did not constitute contracts with the purchaser, is not irrational and must be given deference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner newspaper sought to inspect the death certificate of an individual in the possession of respondent city in order to determine whether the individual had died of the disease Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, commonly known as AIDS. After the city and the state denied the request based on N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 4174(1)(a), the newspaper filed suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper alleged that death from such AIDS in the community was a matter of &quot;grave public concern.&quot; In granting the newspaper's request for a copy of the death certificate, the court first determined that in order to insure the maximum public access to government records, full disclosure was compelled unless the city could demonstrate that the requested records fell within 1 of 8 categories of exemptions provided in the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), which, were to be narrowly construed. In determining that the issuance of the death certificate did not constitute an invasion of privacy, the court held that there was no expressed exemptions in the FOIL which granted to a decedent's personal representative, or to the next-of-kin or survivors of a decedent, the right on decedent's behalf to prevent disclosure of decedent's death certificate. Where rights of personal privacy were involved the exercise of the rights were limited to the living and could not be asserted by others after decedent's death. The court concluded that the city had not met its burden of proof that the certificate was exempted from disclosure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent City of Port Jervis improperly denied the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request of petitioner newspaper publisher to inspect the death certificate of a person suspected of having died from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) on the ground that the request was not &quot;necessary or required for judicial or other proper purposes&quot; (Public Health Law &sect; 4174 [1] [a]), since the death certificate is not exempt from FOIL disclosure as &quot;an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy&quot; or as an item &quot;specifically exempted&quot; from disclosure by State statute (Public Officers Law &sect; 87 [2]).  The protection against unwarranted invasion of privacy is limited to the living and may not be asserted by others after the decedent's death while Public Health Law &sect; 4174 does not establish a clear legislative intent to exempt death certificates from disclosure. Once petitioner's FOIL appeal was denied by the city's governing body, it was entitled to seek judicial review (Public Officers Law &sect; 89 [4] [a], [b]) and was not required to pursue administrative review within the Department of Health.  Accordingly, since AIDS is a matter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of great public concern, petitioner has a legitimate and specific public purpose in seeking to gather and publish information concerning a possible case of AIDS in the locality served by its newspaper and it is thus entitled to access to the death certificate. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health (commissioner) filed a motion for an order pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20 extending the order of conditions subject to which the criminal defendant was discharged from inpatient treatment for the ensuing five years. Respondent counsel, on behalf of defendant, liminally opposed the motion, arguing such an extension under &sect; 330.20(1)(o) violated the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court accepted defendant's plea that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, determined that defendant had neither a dangerous mental disorder nor was mentally ill, and entered an order of conditions pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 330.20(1)(o) that required defendant to comply with a treatment plan which included screening and in-patient treatment for five years. The commissioner filed his motion upon the expiration of that five year term. The court liminally considered the counsel's constitutional objections and entered an order rejecting them. Section 330.20(1)(o) provided that, for good cause shown, the order of conditions could be extended for an additional five year period. The commissioner or the prosecuting district attorney could apply for the extension. Section 300.20(17) ensured that a defendant's liberty interests would be protected and provided adequate procedural and substantive safeguards. Section 330.20 balanced the public's safety interests with a defendant's liberty interests and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision of the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1980 authorizing the court to renew the initial five-year &quot;order of conditions&quot;, directing a defendant found not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect to comply with a &quot;prescribed treatment plan&quot; for an additional five-year period &quot;for good cause shown&quot; ( CPL 330.20 [1] [o]), does not constitute such an impermissible discrimination against nonresponsibility acquittees as to deny equal protection since provision of a longer period of supervision after custody in the case of nonresponsibility acquittees is not inconsistent with the constitutional mandate that no one be retained in custody by reason of mental disease or defect absent a finding of mental illness and dangerousness to self or others.  The function of the order of conditions is to provide a safeguard to the public that is peculiar to nonresponsibility acquittees and it is less restrictive than and provides an alternative safeguard to custody under an order even in the case where the order of conditions permits transfer to a nonsecure or private facility.  The statute is not &quot;void for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vagueness&quot; since the requirement of &quot;good cause&quot; imposes a burden of justification on the applicant in the context of the over-all statutory scheme which provides for continuing hearings until discharge with a spectrum of carefully limited types of custody: the commitment and retention orders, the furlough order, the transfer order and recommitment order.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners brought an action challenging the constitutionality of defendant city's legislation prohibiting the conversion, alteration, or demolition of privately owned buildings containing single-room occupancy (SRO) units. The owners sought declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Previous legislation attempting to prohibit the conversion or alteration of privately owned SRO buildings had been found unconstitutional. In response, the city enacted new legislation, which differed from the previous legislation by the addition of a cash buy-out provision, the obligation of SRO owners to create replacement housing, and the addition of a hardship escape provision. The court held that the exemptions added to the law did not alleviate the constitutional infirmities found in its predecessor legislation. The law still contained an antiwarehousing provision forcing owners to make these units habitable and to rent them to bona fide tenants, which was previously held to be unconstitutional. Moreover, the buy-out and replacement exemptions required the owners to pay exorbitant fees in order to escape the regulation, thereby constituting an excessive financial burden on the owners. The court found that the law placed an unfair and uncompensated burden on one class of property owners to subsidize a low-income housing program administered by the city and denied the owners use of their properly without compensation in violation of the due process and takings clauses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buy-out, replacement and hardship exemptions contained in the new single-room occupancy (SRO) legislation (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 27-198.2) fail to alleviate the constitutional infirmities in the previously invalidated SRO law, prohibiting the conversion, alteration of demolition of privately owned SRO buildings and placing an affirmative obligation on SRO owners to renovate their buildings </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 134 Misc 2d 187), since the exemptions are tantamount to extortion and place an unfair and uncompensated burden on one class of property owners in violation of the due process rights of SRO owners.  The limited statutory cash buyout, in the amount of $ 45,000 per unit an SRO owner must pay to the New York City Development Fund in order to withdraw an SRO building from the moratorium, extracts an exorbitant price that can prevent SRO owners from recovering the use of their property.  The hardship exemption, which provides for a total or partial reduction in the amount of the cash buyout or of the number of dwelling units to be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  replaced if the Commissioner determines that there is no reasonable rate of return (defined as 8.5% of the property's assessed value as an SRO building) unless the property is altered or converted to another use, is inherently confiscatory and violative of due process because of the total disregard of reasonable &quot;investment backed&quot; expectations on the part of SRO owners.  In addition, the SRO regulatory scheme constitutes an unconstitutional taking for which just compensation must be made.  Although the SRO legislation may be an innovative and well-intentioned attempt to lessen the growth of the homeless population in the City of New York, the city cannot constitutionally force a single segment of property owners to bear a public burden without just compensation.  </SPAN></P>

The state had a compelling interest in safeguarding minors, and the distribution of sexually explicit photographs of minors was related to the sexual abuse of children. An in camera inspection of the grand jury minutes was ordered. The court ordered a hearing to determine whether police conduct in searching and seizing defendants' home was so outrageous as to warrant suppression of items seized, and to ascertain the effect of misrepresentations made in an affidavit for a warrant. A hearing was granted on the motion to suppress statements, and defendants were provided with a summary of the State's debriefing statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, who allegedly engaged in the noncommercial exchange, through the mail, of material featuring persons under the age of 16 in various stages of undress and engaged in sexual acts, may constitutionally be charged with violating Penal Law &sect; 263.15, promoting a sexual performance by a child.  The definition of &quot;promote&quot; contained in Penal Law &sect; 263.00 (5) dispels any notion that section 263.15 is devoted exclusively to &quot;commercial&quot; exploitation. In view of the State's compelling interest in safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of minors, the State is not proscribed from protecting its legitimate State interest through restricting the promotion of sexually exploitive material as defined in the statute; it is not solely the commercial use which creates the harm to the child, but the record of the child's conduct exacerbated by the circulation, which is within the State's legitimate interests to protect through proscribing that conduct.  Accordingly, Penal Law &sect; 263.15 as applied in this case is constitutional pursuant to the New York and Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A search warrant permitting the search and seizure of certain items at the purported residence of defendants, who were charged with promoting a sexual performance of a child in connection with the exchange, through the mail, of material featuring persons under the age of 16 in various stages of undress and engaged in sexual acts was properly issued.  Although defendants argue that the police officer's supporting affidavit does not establish the probable cause necessary to search those premises, there is no compelling reason on the face of the document to disturb the findings of the issuing Judge.  The particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution is satisfied by the warrant and the affidavit coupled with the accompanying exhibits provides sufficient probable cause that obscene materials would be found on the premises.  Finally, a hearing is ordered to determine whether the conduct of the police in searching the house and seizing items not subject to the warrant was so outrageous as to warrant suppression of all the items seized in the search; to determine whether searches made of a safe in one of the defendants' houses and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of certain post-office boxes were consented to or otherwise authorized by the warrant; and as to the effect of certain misrepresentations in the supporting affidavit on the finding of probable cause. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association was established by the legislature to provide medical malpractice insurance. The superintendent established both primary and two levels of excess premium rates for professional liability insurance for physicians and surgeons for two policy years.

The association also sought to compel the superintendent to establish proper premium rates for those three policy years, in compliance with various provisions of the N.Y. Ins. Law. Upon review, the court concluded that the report of the referee should not be accepted and that the determination of the superintendent should be set aside because there was no proper actuarial basis, or other basis before the superintendent, which could serve as a foundation for his determination.</SPAN></P>

The court sua sponte dismissed the complaint for the contractor's failure to plead, as required by N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3015(e), that it was currently licensed in the county. The contractor moved for an order recalling the court's dismissal of the complaint. In reargument, the contractor informed the court that it was licensed at the time the cause of action arose, although its license had been revoked after a formal hearing prior to the commencement of the action. The court granted the motion, reinstated the complaint, and struck the customer's first and third affirmative defenses. The court held that it was not the intent of the legislature to preclude a plaintiff from suing under these circumstances. If a contractor was properly licensed at the time he performed the work, he had an immediate right to maintain an action for payment for services rendered.

CPLR 3015 (e), which in requiring a contractor to plead that he is duly licensed, further provides for him to obtain a license after commencement of the action and then amend his complaint, does not refer to a contractor who formerly held a valid license. Revocation of a contractor's license does not necessarily mean that all of the contractor's work was inferior. He is still entitled to payment for services that were rendered in a workmanlike manner.  It would be an unconstitutional deprivation of property if a contractor were forced to lose claims which had accrued because his license was revoked. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his death, decedent was the state-licensed operator of a nursing home. Claimants, representatives of decedent's estate, sought to shut down the unprofitable operation, but defendant state obtained a temporary restraining order and appointment of receivers to force the nursing home to remain open. Money claims were pursued against the state, including a claim for legal and accounting fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court previously concluded that the state's insistence upon running the nursing home constituted a de facto taking for which the state was obligated to compensate claimants. At issue was whether claimants were entitled to recover their accounting and legal expenses and whether those expenses were fair and reasonable. The court entered judgment for claimants, concluding that they were entitled to the full amount of legal and accounting fees sought. First, the court held that constitutionally required just compensation generally did not include legal and associated expenses incurred in fixing the value of property taken by eminent domain. Nevertheless, N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law &sect; 702(C) provided a statutory exception that allowed payment of such expenses here. The state's de facto rather than de jure taking forced claimants to establish both that a taking had been effected and the value of the property taken. Valuation expenses could not be separated in this complex litigation. Second, reading Ct. Cl. Act &sect; 27 to prohibit the award of expenses described in N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law &sect; 702 was utterly inconsistent with the purposes of the New York Eminent Domain Procedure Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for claimants in their action to recover legal and accounting fees incurred by them in asserting that a de facto taking had occurred when the state forced them to continue to run a nursing home formerly operated by decedent. The court held that claimants were entitled to the full amount of legal and accounting fees sought.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Court of Claims is the appropriate forum in which to adjudicate an application by a condemnee for reimbursement for legal and accounting expenses it incurred in establishing a de facto taking by the State of its property, notwithstanding the fact that most of the fees charged were incurred for matters handled in Supreme Court, since the Court of Claims possesses jurisdiction over money claims against the State; moreover, EDPL 501 (A) confers on the Court of Claims &quot;exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims arising from the acquisition of real property by or in the name of the people of the state of New York&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- De Facto Appropriation -- Legal and Accounting Expenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Recovery of a condemnee's legal and accounting expenses attributable to establishing a de facto taking of its property by the State is authorized by EDPL 702 (C) and may be sought in the Court of Claims, notwithstanding the fact that Court of Claims Act &sect; 27 limits recovery of such expenses to those provided in EDPL 701, since reading section 27 to prohibit the award&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of expenses described in EDPL 702 is utterly inconsistent with the purposes of the over-all scheme of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law, which is to provide the exclusive procedure by which property shall be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain in the State; significantly, unlike other sections of the EDPL, EDPL 701 and 702 make no distinction between proceedings in the Court of Claims and those in Supreme Court with respect to the awards of expert witness' fees, attorneys' fees and other costs, and the logical import of those provisions is that both were intended to apply equally to condemnation proceedings irrespective of whether jurisdiction over such proceedings lay in the Court of Claims or Supreme Court.  Moreover, EDPL 705 provides that the provisions of the EDPL shall be controlling notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of any general or special law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- De Facto Appropriation -- Interest on Award for Legal and Accounting Expenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a condemnation action, claimants are entitled to interest on an award of attorney's fees and accounting expenses where they had to establish a de facto taking by the State, because the State deprived&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them of possession and enjoyment of their property </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPLR 5001 [a]), and inasmuch as claimants are seeking to recover fees already paid or incurred, it is the date upon which they rendered payment which should govern with respect to the computation of interest, rather than the date on which the services were completed or billed.  Although EDPL 702 is directed at compensation for legal expenses incurred incident to establishing the existence of a de facto taking and not at the expenses of establishing the value of the property taken, the nature of the instant claim and the complex issues connected with it made it virtually impossible to separate out the &quot;de facto&quot; expenses from the &quot;valuation&quot; expenses.  </SPAN></P>

The Superintendent promulgated a final regulation that established the plan, which the Society and its president challenged. The Superintendent filed a cross-motion to dismiss the petition.

Plaintiff's challenge to regulation 124 (11 NYCRR part 152), which establishes a physicians professional liability insurance merit rating plan reflecting an individual physician's or surgeon's experience with respect to incidents or occurrences of alleged medical malpractice, is not rendered premature or moot by the fact that the regulation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  permits periodic adjustment of those factors specified for assigning points to generate surcharges; the regulation has been in effect for over one year and plaintiffs' attacks on the regulation are directed at its face, not as applied to individual physicians.  Plaintiffs' claims that the regulation permits a confiscatory taking of property by establishing a period of review of chargeable losses which exceeds the limits of reasonable retroactivity and that it arbitrarily and capriciously discriminates among doctors in terms of dollar amounts charged per premium surcharge because it fails to distinguish between the risks faced by physicians practicing different medical specialties state a valid cause of action for confiscatory taking and violation of substantive due process.  Further, in light of the apparent unequal treatment of doctors with similar experience records and the current lack of an articulated reason for the disparity, it cannot be concluded that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action for arbitrary and capricious discrimination under the regulation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss an indictment charging him with third-degree rape and endangering the welfare of an incompetent person.

The court held that even though the state's application to present the victim as a special witness was factually deficient, the victim qualified as a special witness based upon the court's observation of her demeanor in the videotape. Furthermore, the age of the victim, more than 16, did not preclude her from illustrating what happened by using anatomically correct dolls; N.Y. Crim. Proc.

The Legislature expressly stated in CPL 190.30 that CPL 190.32 could not be construed to limit the Grand Jury's power to subpoena any person it believes possesses knowledge or information of the crimes it is investigating.  Further, it appears that the Grand Jury accepted the videotaped statement as sufficient, and the Assistant District Attorney conducting the examination on tape and presenting the case to the Grand Jury said nothing to indicate that this particular witness' testimony should be given any special consideration or credence because of the manner in which her testimony was presented.</SPAN></P>

Although the People's ex parte application to have the victim determined a special witness under CPL 190.32 is inadequate insofar as it lacks sufficient sworn allegations of fact supporting the allegations that the victim would suffer severe emotional or mental stress if required to testify, the victim's status can be affirmed through the court's review of the victim's videotaped statement.  To reverse the order granting special witness status to the victim because of the insufficiency of the People's factual allegations as to emotional or mental stress would serve no useful purpose in light of the court's ability to observe her testimony firsthand.</SPAN></P>

Although CPL 60.44 refers specifically to the use of anatomically correct dolls by persons under 16 years of age, it does not preclude the use of such dolls by persons 16 years of age and older.

The allegation that defendant had no knowledge of the victim's inability to consent is an issue separate and apart from the elements of rape in the third degree which the People must still prove beyond a reasonable doubt; further, it would be unfair to have the People attempt to prove a negative, particularly when the information is within defendant's own knowledge.  Moreover, the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to the particular defendant in this case.  </SPAN></P>

Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.11 and N.Y. Comp. Codes. R. &amp; Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 517.4 were violative of mentally ill patients' rights under the Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advocate and patients challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.11 and N.Y. Comp. Codes. R. &amp; Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 517.4, claiming they violated the rights of mentally ill patients under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The challenged laws permitted the transfer of involuntarily committed mentally ill patients from acute-care facilities to long-term facilities, over objection, and without a prior judicial hearing as to the need for such transfer. The court determined that the laws were unconstitutional, finding that an involuntarily committed patient did not forfeit all constitutional protections as the result of such commitment. The court held that due process protection attached to the decision to transfer mentally ill patients from acute care to long term care facilities because the transfer represented a major change in the condition and duration of confinement and should only be imposed after a determination that long-term confinement was warranted. The court concluded that a judicial hearing had to be held prior to the transfer if such a hearing was required to protect the interests of mentally ill patients.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transfer of involuntarily committed mentally ill patients from an acute-care facility to a long-term facility, over objection and without prior judicial hearing as to the need for such transfer (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 29.11; 14 NYCRR 517.4), is violative of the rights of mentally ill patients to due process of law since the transfer represents a major change in the condition and duration of confinement and is normally imposed only when it is determined that an individual is in need of intermediate or long-term confinement. The mere fact that the transfer might be motivated by the desire or necessity to alleviate overcrowding to meet the demand for inpatient treatment in acute-care psychiatric facilities is a conflict which prevents the director of the transferring facility from deciding the issues in an unbiased and impartial manner.  While the aim of the statute and regulations is to utilize the limited resources for treatment of the mentally ill in the most expeditious manner so that a treatment in an acute-care facility is limited to those individuals who will most benefit, expediency, efficiency and costs in terms of time and effort&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are not paramount governmental interests where due process protections are involved.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because the violation of &sect; 1802(a) was not committed until defendant failed to file the personal income tax return for the third year. The crime that defendant was charged with was defined in terms of three separate components that spanned a three year period and the effective date of &sect; 1802(a) preceded the date on which the crime of three sequential non-filings was executed by defendant.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 1802 (a), effective November 1, 1985, which makes it a class E felony to fail to file State tax returns for three consecutive years, is not an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to defendant because of the incorporation of 1983 and 1984 nonfilings as part of the offense since the statute does not increase punishment for failure to file 1983 and 1984 tax returns but, rather, it simply toughens the penalty for the 1985 nonfiling, exclusively in the context of two immediate and sequential prior omissions where there is outstanding tax liability. While the criminal activity technically began in 1983 when nonfiling was punishable as a misdemeanor, the crime was not in fact committed within the meaning of section 1802 (a) until April 15, 1986 when the third filing was due and, as such, this is not a case where the defendant is being subjected to a greater penalty for committing a crime which was consummated before the increased penalty was enacted.

The mortgagor opposed the appointment of a receiver claiming that a sale of the building was imminent and that N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law &sect; 302-b was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building in question was primarily occupied by low-income tenants. The condition of the apartments and common hallways was deplorable. The mortgagor was in default, and a foreclosure action had been commenced. The purpose of &sect; 302-b was to permit and encourage mortgagees of multiple dwellings to remove violations, which the mortgagor had failed to correct. In order to accomplish the purpose of the legislature and keep the housing stock free of hazardous violations, mortgagees had to be allowed to add the moneys advanced for such purposes to the mortgage lien. Nor was there any problem with regard to vagueness as to what repairs with respect to the property could be made by the receiver. The court appointed a receiver and reviewed his or her acts. Such legislation, which was reasonably calculated to provide better living conditions, namely, ones not hazardous to life, health, or safety, was in the best interest of the public welfare. Protecting the public welfare was a proper concern of government. Therefore, &sect; 302-b was constitutional.

Furthermore, the additional provision that the sums advanced &quot;shall be added to the amount of the lien of such mortgagee&quot; is not an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law since the statute properly addresses a proper concern of government of protecting the public welfare by providing better living conditions.  In order to accomplish the purpose of the statute and keep the housing stock free of hazardous violations, mortgagees must be allowed to add the moneys advanced to remove violations to the mortgage lien. </SPAN></P>

The State argued that the safety stickers were vehicle identification numbers and that defendant's removal of the stickers violated &sect; 170.70.

A person cannot possess a vehicle part with the VIN removed (Penal Law &sect; 170.70 [2]).  However, the statute requires that a VIN be &quot;stamped or embossed&quot; and that the only sanctioned VIN locations be on the major component parts, to wit, the nose, the frame, the engine, the transmission, and in one secret location chosen by the manufacturer, usually located under a wheel well or back seat of the automobile.  Thus, automobile doors are not major component parts, nor were they stamped or embossed. Furthermore, the alleged VINs were contained within Federal safety pollution stickers which defendant had an implied duty to remove from noncomponent parts prior to resale pursuant to motor vehicle regulations. Therefore, dismissal of challenged counts of the indictment is granted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants issued a press release announcing a ban on bicycles on certain streets during designated hours.

Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (7) in a manner worthy of high praise for their eloquent craftsmanship, and although its &quot;satisfactory explanation&quot; provision did raise constitutional uncertainty, the court was constrained to conclude that defendant had failed to discharge its burden of proving the statute's constitutional invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt. The statute merely prohibited loitering at a specific location and was, therefore, sustainable. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss the loitering charge on the grounds that it was unconstitutional was denied. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied as the court found the search was a legal search limited to that which was necessary for discovery of weapons which might have been used to harm the officers or others nearby.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant has failed to prove that Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (7), which provides that a person is guilty of loitering when he &quot;[loiters] or remains in any transportation facility or is found sleeping therein, and is unable to give a satisfactory explanation of his presence&quot;, is unconstitutionally vague since there is a reasonable relationship between the welfare of the public-at-large, and the concern and efforts of the Legislature to insure the safety of the many patrons who utilize transportation facilities which often serve as the setting of violent crimes.  In addition, a hypodermic instrument (Penal Law &sect; 220.45) was lawfully seized from defendant's pocket by police officers who awoke defendant to determine why he was sleeping on a bench in a waiting room of the Freeport railroad station since defendant's actions in placing his hand in his sweatshirt&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pocket and then refusing to remove his hand stating &quot;I have something I'm not supposed to have in my pocket&quot; gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that the officers were in danger of physical injury and thereby justified a limited legal search of defendant's pocket for a weapon. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claiming authority moved for an order confirming the ex parte order of attachment by the County Court (New York). Defendant opposed the confirmation of the order of attachment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had criminal charges against him. The claiming authority, the district attorney, moved for an order confirming the criminal court's order of attachment. The court found that the claiming authority had established: (1) a substantial probability of success; (2) that failure to confirm the ex parte order might have resulted in the property being destroyed, removed, or otherwise unavailable for forfeiture; and (3) that the need to preserve assets outweighed the hardship suffered by the defendant. The court rejected defendant's argument that he was in need of access to the attached funds to meet his living expenses, finding that he still had access to some funds and the use of much of his property. The court found no factual basis for the assertion that the seizure deprived defendant of his right to counsel. However, the court found that the order granting attachment might have been invalid, as the claiming authority had not complied with N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1318(2). Defendant had not indicated his willingness to give an undertaking in an amount equal to the value of the property sought to be discharged; thus, his motion for a discharge of attachment was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ex parte order of attachment of defendant's property is confirmed subject to the timely submission of proof of the filing of the complaint ( CPLR 1318 [2]) since the claiming authority, by submission of affirmations, affidavits and exhibits, including excerpts from the transcripts of intercepted communications not excluded from evidence, has established a substantial probability of success on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to confirm the order may result in the property being destroyed, removed from the jurisdiction of the court or otherwise unavailable for forfeiture ( CPLR 1312 [3] [a]).  Defendant has not shown that the seizure of his property effectively deprives him of his constitutional right to counsel since he can apply to the court for release of his funds </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">pro tanto</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor has he shown that the forfeiture statute is unconstitutional by requiring him to give up his Fifth Amendment right to silence in order to exercise his due process right to be heard.  Due to the clandestine nature of the underlying criminal charges, the proceeds cannot be determined with absolute&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  certainty at this preliminary stage but the claiming authority has made a just and reasonable estimate of proceeds.  County Court has jurisdiction over the civil forfeiture action notwithstanding its $ 25,000 jurisdictional limit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPLR 1310 [7]; CPL 10.10).  Since the forfeiture statute provides little guidance to the parties and courts faced with the task of interpreting and applying its often obscure provisions, the Legislature should clarify the statute to allow uniform application in all civil forfeiture actions.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court dismissed the petitioner's cause of action alleging jail overcrowding, because the allegations raised did not amount to excessive conditions of confinement that resulted in punishment. The court granted the application for class certification by petitioner and the intervening petitioners, because all of the prerequisites set forth in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 901 had been satisfied. Petitioners alleged that that the population of the county jail was allowed to exceed the maximum prisoner capacity in contravention of the applicable rules and regulations. Respondents contended that the allegations of overcrowding did not amount to a U.S. Const. amend. VIII violation of the petitioners' rights. The court held that while the overcrowding may have been harsh and uncomfortable, that did not make it cruel and unusual and therefore unconstitutional. Accordingly, there was no cruel and inhuman punishment against petitioners and the court dismissed their cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Intervention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding to compel respondents to eliminate alleged overcrowded conditions at a county jail brought by an inmate at the jail who is no longer incarcerated there, petitioner's application to serve an amended petition naming five individuals who are or were inmates of the jail as intervening copetitioners, is granted.  The intervenors are in the same situation which has given rise to petitioner's claim, and allowing intervention will not prejudice the rights of any party to the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Actions -- Class Actions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding to compel respondents to eliminate alleged overcrowded conditions at a county jail, an application for class certification is granted.  The five prerequisites for a class action contained in CPLR 901 have been satisfied, and it is irrelevant that petitioner is no longer incarcerated in the jail and that the five intervening petitioners have also been released or transferred elsewhere; the general conditions of incarceration complained of may persist, and the matter is not rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 in the nature of mandamus seeking to compel respondents to eliminate alleged overcrowded conditions at a county jail is deemed a declaratory judgment action. It does not appear that petitioners' case lies in mandamus, but rather primarily seeks a declaration whether Federal and State constitutional rights of due process and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment have been violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Overcrowding in County Jail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding seeking to compel respondents to eliminate alleged overcrowded conditions at a county jail, causes of action have not been stated.  Overcrowding, in and of itself, is not a violation of the 8th Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, for those persons incarcerated upon conviction for crimes.  The allegations do not indicate barbarous physical punishment or the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain and the imposition of penalties grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crimes.  For those held in prison awaiting trial, overcrowding, in and of itself, is also not a deprivation of Federal due process rights.  To the extent that petitioners&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  allege that the jail population has been allowed to exceed the maximum capacity promulgated by the Commission of Correction, enforcement of these standards is a matter for the commission and not the courts; a court may intervene only if there are violations of constitutional dimension. Transfer of certain inmates to other county jails in the State is also not a violation of constitutional rights. Finally, enforcement of the mandate contained in CPL 430.20 (1) that defendants sentenced to terms of imprisonment must be forthwith committed to the custody of the appropriate public servant is not for the court except if it finds violations of a constitutional dimension. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to recover for injuries allegedly sustained by their prenatal exposure to their mothers' ingestion of diethylstilbestrol (DES). Although they could not identify the particular manufacturer of the DES they were exposed to, plaintiffs pursued various tort and collective liability theories. The companies moved for summary judgment because they claimed that the right to recover on collective, nonidentification, or concerted action theories of liability had not been established. The court denied the companies' consolidated motions for summary judgment. The court adopted the concerted action theory of recovery for DES cases and determined that plaintiffs could proceed on their clearly stated and viable cause of action for DES collective liability through concert by agreement or substantial assistance. Plaintiffs' inability to identify the actual DES manufacturer was not fatal. The court declined to rule on the applicability of the liability theories that were raised in response to the companies' motions, denied the companies' claims of exculpation, and rejected the companies' constitutional challenges on due process, equal protection, preemption, and commerce grounds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of a definitive ruling by the Court of Appeals, collective, nonidentification or concerted action theories of liability in cases involving injuries caused by prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic hormone manufactured or marketed by between 94 and 300 pharmaceutical companies from 1947 to 1971, are viable in the First Department </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bichler v Lilly &amp; Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 79 AD2d 317, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">affd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;55 NY2d 571) and, therefore, the inability of plaintiffs to identify the particular manufacturer of the DES taken by the mothers of the injured women in each case does not require dismissal of the actions.  A finding of concert by conscious parallelism or substantial assistance may be supported based upon the formation of identical chemical standards for DES in pregnancy, the marketing of the drug without prior testing on pregnant mice and the drug companies' reliance upon the same studies in supplemental new drug applications filed with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Food and Drug Administration.  A collective liability theory under which liability may be imposed upon drug companies without product identification is not violative of due process or equal protection since liability may properly be premised upon the tortious behavior of each defendant that resulted in a harmful product being placed on the market.  In addition, the imposition of liability without product identification is not preempted by Federal law, which is primarily designed to control product safety and efficacy, nor would such liability place an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff woman filed a pharmaceutical product liability action against defendant drug manufacturers alleging that she developed cancer as a result of prenatal exposure to a synthetic estrogen taken by her mother.

C.P.L.R. 208, 214.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cancerous condition that the woman claimed was the result of prenatal exposure to a synthetic estrogen taken by her mother appeared four years after she was barred from commencing an action by the statute of limitations. She filed a pharmaceutical product liability action against the drug manufacturers under the tort revival statute, and the court denied the drug manufacturers' motions for summary judgment and granted the woman's motion to strike the affirmative defenses challenging the constitutionality of the revival statute. The court conducted a rational basis review of the statute for both the drug manufacturers' due process and equal protections claims and concluded that the legislature acted within permissible objectives relating to health, safety, and welfare by reviving causes of action based upon the latent effects of exposure to certain toxic substances. The court found that the legislation and the challenged classifications within it passed muster under the rational basis test or even under the more demanding intermediate standard because it could not be said that the legislature acted unreasonably in selecting the substances for special treatment.</SPAN></P>

In addition, limiting the revival statute to five chosen substances and their manufacturers is not violative of equal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  protection as an underinclusive random penalty without scientific basis since the statutory classification is reasonably based upon the perceived realities of the latent effects of exposure to the five substances, the existence of an identifiable group affected and the resulting ability to predict with some accuracy the economic costs of revival. </SPAN></P>

A dispute arose when the clerk and defendant told the customer that the gas purchase was higher because he wanted to pay by credit card, and that the price on the sign was the discounted price for cash purchases. The customer swore out a complaint and defendant was arrested. Defendant argued that &sect; 518 was unconstitutional. The court agreed, granted the motion to dismiss, and set aside defendant's conviction. In doing so, the court held that the very distinction made by the government, namely, that the statute prohibited a vendor from charging a surcharge for credit card usage, but would not have interfered with that same vendor establishing the higher price for credit card sales and then allowing a comparable discount for cash purchases, required that the statute be invalidated on due process grounds, at least as applied in the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Business Law &sect; 518, which prohibits vendors from imposing a surcharge for credit card usage but permits merchants to have two-tier pricing systems for &quot;cash discounts&quot;, is unconstitutional as violative of substantive due process as applied to defendant, a gas station operator convicted of attempting to charge a credit card customer a &quot;credit price&quot; 5 cents more per gallon than the price posted on the top of the pump, since the statute, by permitting a price differential so long as that differential is characterized as a discount for payment by cash and not as an additional charge for payment by use of a credit card, creates a distinction without a difference that impermissibly allows the same conduct to be labeled as lawful or unlawful on the basis of semantics only.  The statute is not saved by the semantic gyration of claiming that it contemplates the establishment of a &quot;regular price&quot; for a product, that a &quot;discount&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for cash&quot; from that &quot;regular price&quot; is permitted and that it is only the &quot;surcharge&quot;, or additional charge for use of a credit card which is prohibited since there is at the &quot;gas&quot; pump a legally permissible &quot;cash price&quot; and a legally permissible &quot;credit price&quot;.  It is intolerable that a gas station operator careless enough to describe the higher price in terms which amount to the &quot;credit price&quot; having been derived from adding a charge to the lower price faces the prospect of criminal conviction and possible imprisonment.

The court dismissed the indictment for failure on its face to state a crime under &sect; 263.15. Because the term &quot;procure&quot; was susceptible to two or more meanings, the court was required to determine the intention of the legislature. The court found that there was no suggestion in the legislative history, and no language in the statute, that &sect; 263.15 was intended to punish the customer of a sexual performance for his own private use. The court also found that the term &quot;procure&quot; had to be construed consistently with the other terms in the statute, all of which prohibited conduct relating to the creation and distribution of the prohibited performance. Thus, the statute was not intended to punish the ultimate consumer.</SPAN></P>

The court held that N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 7300 et seq., the statutes regulating the practice of architecture, were constitutionally sound. There was a legitimate exercise of police power in regulating the practice of architecture. N.Y. Educ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 3383 was unconstitutional because it was uncertain as to what persons came within its scope or how guilt was to be ascertained.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statute proscribing possession of an imitation controlled substance (Public Health Law &sect; 3383) is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad since the statute contains the element of intent and refers to the clear Penal Law definition of &quot;controlled substance&quot;.  However, an accusatory instrument charging defendant with possession of an imitation controlled substance, for possessing a white powdery substance &quot;packaged exactly as * * * cocaine is packaged for street sale&quot; is dismissed for insufficiency ( CPL 100.40) in the absence of a recitation of the complainant's experience or background that would explain his basis for knowing &quot;pony pak&quot; paper, how it is folded and how the package is one for street sale.  In addition, the petit larceny charge (Penal Law &sect; 155.25) based upon defendant's alleged acceptance of $ 10 from a police officer for a substance purported to be marihuana is likewise dismissed for insufficiency since there is no factual allegation that the substance purchased from defendant was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not worth the $ 10 paid.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district filed a declaratory judgment action against defendants, state officials and a school district, challenging the officials' modification of the school district's tax base, which caused a reduction in the school district's state aid to education. The members of the board of education had sought to intervene, the school district and the officials had sought summary judgment, and the officials had sought a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consideration of the challenge to the addresses reported by a certain school district, the state officials, which determined the amount of &quot;state aid to education&quot; to a district on the combined total gross adjusted income of the residents of each district, added the addresses to the school district's tax base, substantially reducing its state aid. The district sought a declaratory and summary judgment against the officials alleging that the school district was not given an opportunity to review the additions to its tax base and that the officials had no power under 1984 N.Y. Laws 889 to unilaterally reduce its state aid, and the officials sought a change of venue and summary judgment. The court held that: (1) a declaratory judgment action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 213 was the appropriate vehicle to challenge the implementation of the statute; (2) the action was filed within the six-year statute of limitations period; and (3) while 1984 N.Y. Laws 889 was constitutional, the officials' implementation thereof and the revision of the school aid formula was a denial of their rights because they were inconsistent therewith in not providing the district with an appellate review thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the school district's summary judgment motion, ordered the officials to reimburse the school district accordingly, and enjoined the officials from employing the proposed modified system to calculate the state aid to the school district.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manner in which the State defendants, the Commissioner of Education, the Commissioner of the Department of Taxation and Finance and the Director of the Budget, implemented legislation creating an Interagency Task Force &quot;to conduct a study of alternatives for the establishment of a statewide address match and income verification system * * * with respect to improving and modifying the data used in distributing school aid to local school districts&quot; (L 1984, ch 889 [State aid to local school districts being based in part on the combined adjusted gross income of school district residents]) is arbitrary and unfair as applied to plaintiff.  Defendants deprived plaintiff and other school districts of their rights by selecting certain identified school districts to participate in the pilot program and then proceeding to change the entire State aid formula, accepting at face value the challenges of the identified districts, without any outside verification or appeal by the districts affected, thereby diminishing the State aid to neighboring school districts. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The addresses challenged by a neighboring school district and added to plaintiff's tax base increased plaintiff's adjusted gross income by more than $ 76 million resulting in a diminution in State aid of $ 771,584 for the 1985-1986 school year. Since a declaratory judgment action, rather than an article 78 proceeding, is the proper vehicle to challenge defendants' implementation of the statute, the proceeding commenced one year after plaintiff received its initial reduced State aid payment is timely and venue need not be moved to Albany County.  Plaintiff has standing to object to the State's implementation of the law as being at odds with the statutory language and, in addition, injunctive relief is the only method available to plaintiff to prevent defendants, without specific direction from the Legislature, from reducing its aid in the future.  </SPAN></P>

The ordinance regulated the number of unrelated people who could live together. The court modified the judgments and affirmed as so modified. The court found that the city had a legitimate purpose in establishing occupancy limitations, including preservation of the character of traditional single-family neighborhoods, reduction of parking and traffic problems, control of population density, and prevention of noise and disturbance, among others. The definition of &quot;family&quot; in Albany, N.Y., Code &sect; 27-160 included those that were the functional equivalent of a traditional family and did not require the existence of blood, marriage, or adoption, placed no restriction on the number of unrelated children who could reside together, and allowed up to three unrelated adults to live together, so it passed muster. The portion of the ordinance providing for cumulative penalties, and pursuant to which defendants were sentenced, was invalid.

However, the portion of the ordinance providing for cumulative penalties is invalid since imposition of cumulative fines or penalties for a single but continuing violation of a zoning ordinance is not permitted and the fine imposed on the defendants sentenced under such provision is reduced from $ 12,500 to $ 2,750.  In addition, since the remaining defendant could not be convicted of continuing violations not specifically charged in the informations, the fine imposed on her is reduced to $ 750.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state hired the claimant as a clerk when he was 73 years old. The claimant misrepresented his age as 57, believing that the state would not hire him if the state knew that he was over 70. Retirement was mandatory at 70. After working for 10 years the claimant applied for retirement benefits. The state denied the application because retirement would have been mandatory as soon as the claimant joined the state if he had told the truth, and no benefits would have been paid. The claimant had also filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, however he had not perfected his appeal from a decision against him. The court granted the state's motion. The statutory/contractual scheme was in place when the claimant fabricated his way into a state job and it became part of his constitutionally protected contractual pension rights when he started working. There was no change in these rights and, thus, they could not be said to have been unconstitutionally diminished. Further, the comptroller had exclusive authority to determine applications for any form of retirement and a final determination was subject to review only as provided in art. 78. Thus, the court lacked jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Claimant's contract claim for retirement benefits, filed in the Court of Claims, should be dismissed, and the State's motion for summary judgment granted, since the subject claim is wholly within the purview of the Retirement and Social Security Law and hence wholly outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.  Disputes involving retirement benefits should be judicially determined through the procedural vehicle of a CPLR article 78 proceeding in Supreme Court (Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 74 [b], [d]), where all aspects of claimant's would-be contract claim can be presented.  </SPAN></P>

The owner contend that if read in the context of the entire sentence, the words &quot;owners of buildings&quot; meant something else. Therefore, the owner asserted that the housing authority's decision to exclude cooperative and condominium owners from obtaining rent increases from their respective tenants was arbitrary and capricious. The court denied the owner's petition, holding that only owners of building, under the statute were entitled to apply for alternative hardship relief.</SPAN></P>

The determination of respondent State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the agency responsible for administering the rent laws, that alternative &quot;hardship&quot; rental increases are available only to owners of buildings and should not be measured on an ad hoc unit-by-unit basis because the economic positions of owners of rent-stabilized apartments in condominium and cooperative buildings is not reflective of the building's total income and expenses, is consistent with the original purpose for enacting the law of assisting owners with rent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  levels which were not sufficient to enable owners to pay the operating expenses of the building.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents challenged an interpretation of a state education law by the commissioner that they claimed denied their handicapped children the placement they were entitled to under the Education for the Handicapped Act (EHA). The court held for the parents, who then filed a motion for attorneys' fees and costs under the EHA, 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1415(e)(4)(B). The court granted the motion and rejected respondents' claim that this was not the type of action in which fees were allowed under the EHA. The court noted that 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1415(e) authorized an action to challenge a final administrative determination by an education commissioner following an appeal to him by a party aggrieved by a determination of a local educational agency in an administrative hearing. The court stated that the action attacked by the parents involved an action taken by the commissioner, rather than an appeal of an action taken by a local agency. The court found that this distinction did not require the denial of the parents' motion. Despite some procedural irregularities, the action qualified as one under the EHA. The court also noted that a broad construction of the EHA required granting the motion.</SPAN></P>

The litigation, which deals with the claim that the Commissioner's erroneous interpretation of Education Law &sect; 4407 (2) denied four handicapped children the placement they were entitled to under EHA and Education Law article 89, is an action or proceeding under 20 USC &sect; 1415. Awarding attorneys' fees does not constitute a violation of the impairment of Contract Clause of the Federal Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 10).

In dismissing the charge against defendant, the court held that there was no evidence that the parking of the vehicle had become illegal.

The statute should be construed to mean that if a vehicle is left on a public highway in which parking is legally permitted at the time the vehicle is parked, but subsequently the parking becomes illegal and the vehicle is parked in such area for 48 hours after the parking first became illegal, the violation of abandoned vehicle would have been committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial of defendant was lengthy. Defense counsel submitted vouchers for over 255 hours for in-court time and 137 hours for out-of-court time, for a total of $ 13,490. Under N.Y. County Law art. 18-B, &sect; 722-b, however, compensation was limited to a total of $ 1,200. The court found that the length of the trial was, in large part, because of the lengthy and unabated applications made by defense counsel. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the challenges and applications were, if not frivolous, &quot;throw-away&quot; applications. The court found that the statute did not define the &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; in which additional compensation was to be awarded, above and beyond the statutory $ 1,200. In addition, the cases deciding the issue were in conflict. Therefore, the court made a list of relevant factors, including, but not limited to: the complexity of the issues, the seriousness of the charges, the extent to which counsel was compelled to expend additional hours due to circumstances beyond his control, and the extent to which additional time was unnecessarily expended.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon application by assigned counsel pursuant to County Law &sect; 722-b for compensation beyond the statutory limit of $ 1,200 with respect to his representation of an indigent defendant, the court is to consider the complexity of the issues, the seriousness of the charges, the extent to which counsel was compelled to expend additional hours due to circumstances beyond his control, the extent to which additional time was unnecessarily and unreasonably expended, the fact that participating attorneys are aware that the limited fees provided fall short of full compensation for their services, and, to a lesser extent, actual hours expended, results achieved, experience and stature of counsel at the Bar, and the cost of such services if provided by private counsel. Accordingly, upon assigned counsel's claim for 255.5 hours expended in court and 137 hours expended out of court, for a total of $ 13,490, compensation is limited to the maximum permitted by law, plus a reasonable supplement to compensate counsel for extra time spent beyond his control; to grant the compensation request would do violence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the purpose of the law and would shock the conscience of the court.

The court dismissed the petition. The court found that the decisions were based on N.Y. Soc. Serv.

The revised law and regulations required consideration of the grandmother's income when determining the need for eligibility of her grandchild. Under this statute, the court stated that the grandmother's income had to be considered because her daughter, the child's mother, was a minor and resided with the child in the grandmother's household. The court rejected the grandmother's argument that the revised statute violated the federal equal protection clause. The disparate treatment accorded persons in the grandmother's position did not offend the U.S. Constitution because there was a rational basis for the classification.

Law &sect; 5108. Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The court granted defendant's motion and held that encompassed within the police power of the state was the power of the state to regulate medical fees. The court determined that as an exercise of the police power, a statute regulating medical fees was valid when it was enacted for the promotion of the health, comfort, safety, and welfare of the people and when the means adopted to secure that end were reasonable. The court found that &sect; 5108 was enacted to contain the cost of no-fault insurance premiums and to end the practice of significantly higher health care charges for auto accident victims than for persons not suffering auto injuries. The court held that there was nothing irrational in the state's saying that doctors had to follow the rule set forth in &sect; 5108.

In a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of a statute, the complaint is dismissed insofar as it is asserted by the fictitious plaintiff &quot;John Doe&quot;, who purportedly represents a class of individuals, since there must be a real plaintiff in every action, and to maintain a civil action it is necessary that plaintiff be a person in law, an entity which the law of the forum can recognize as capable of possessing and asserting a right of action. The naming of &quot;John Doe&quot; as a plaintiff appeared to be an attempt by the real individual plaintiff to represent a class of which he is not a member, and the purpose of the class action statute ( CPLR art 9) may not be subverted by simply naming a fictitious &quot;John Doe&quot; as a plaintiff, since the court has no jurisdiction to litigate issue for people not before it who are supposedly represented by a fictitious plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as there is nothing irrational about New York State saying that doctors, whose practice is already regulated pursuant to the State's police powers, must follow the rule set forth in the statute, plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action in this declaratory judgment action seeking to declare the statute unconstitutional, and defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint shall be granted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lawmakers enacted a local ordinance that prohibited smoking by the public in a meeting place, which was in a school building. The school district brought an action challenging the ordinance and filed a motion for summary judgment. The lawmakers filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the court. The court noted that the ordinance made no attempt to regulate activities within the context of education. The court found that the ordinance was not related to the maintenance, support, or administration of the educational system as provided by N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 11(1)(c). The court held that Suffolk County, N.Y., Local Law No. 12-84, was consistent with and supplemental to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 409 because &sect; 409 applied primarily to the safety and education of pupils and the local ordinance made no attempt to regulate student activity or interfere with the school district's educational function. The court further held that &sect; 409 did not preempt Suffolk County, N.Y., Local Law No. 12-84. The court noted that school buildings were not within the category of institutions addressed by N.Y. Pub. Health Law art 13-E, &sect; 1399-o.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A county ordinance which prohibits smoking by the public in a meeting place is not an unconstitutional usurpation of the State's role in education by virtue of the fact that under the ordinance smoking would be prohibited in public school buildings used as meeting places, since the ordinance makes no attempt to regulate the educational function of the school system nor does it attempt to regulate the structure, maintenance or administration of schools.  The ordinance does not offend Education Law &sect; 409, which applies primarily to the safety and education of pupils with respect to the construction of school buildings and is not intended to govern all matters concerning public health in school buildings, nor 8 NYCRR part 155, which addresses smoking in the context of fire prevention. Moreover, the ordinance does not run afoul of Public Health Law &sect; 1399-o, which prohibits smoking in specified areas open for public use, since a school building is not available to the public as a meeting place during regular business hours, and, therefore, should not be considered among the areas the Legislature&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sought to exclude from the smoking prohibition.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court made a finding that three-year-old twin girls were abused based on proof that one twin was sexually abused by respondent father. The children were in the custody of their mother, who lived with her parents at the time of the abuse. After the fact finding, all counsel agreed that respondent and the children should be evaluated by a court-appointed psychiatrist, but respondent also requested that the court order psychiatric examinations of the children's mother, grandparents and other relatives who were visiting the home within three months of the time the abuse took place. Petitioner Commissioner of Social Services claimed that the court lacked the authority to order the additional evaluations. The court held that under Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 251, member-of-household custodians were only custodians, and thus subject to court ordered evaluations when they were alleged to have harmed the subject child. Since no allegations had been made against the relatives, the court declined to order their evaluations. The court ordered the mother's examination, even absent allegations of harm, because the court's need for the information outweighed any intrusion imposed on the mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In compliance with the Transportation Gross Receipts Tax, N.Y.

The transportation companies shipped under air waybills and were regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board which issued operating authorizations for the transportation companies to engage in business as air freight forwarders. The taxing authorities alleged that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 184 was constitutional and that the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1513, and the Supremacy Clause of United States Constitution did not prevent the taxing authorities from imposing taxes on New York gross receipts of freight forwarders. The court granted summary judgment to the transportation companies and held that the tax was a gross receipts tax imposed on the sale of air transport services and that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1513 prohibited New York from taxing directly or indirectly the sale of air transportation or the gross receipts derived therefrom.

Tax Law &sect; 1262(c)&nbsp;unconstitutional to the extent that it provided for the allocation of county sales and use taxes by agreement between the county and its cities, and to permanently enjoin the state comptroller from approving the agreements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The essential complaint of plaintiffs was that the town was not getting an appropriate share of the sales tax revenues raised by the applicable provisions of the &sect; 1262(c) and that they had standing to challenge the law and its application. The State moved to dismiss on the ground that plaintiffs lacked standing and that they failed to join necessary parties. The court dismissed plaintiffs' action. The court found the State's ground of dismissal for failure to join necessary parties to be without merit. However, the court found that, with respect to sales taxes, only the counties and cites had the power to tax not the towns. The court noted that the taxing authorities decided which formula would be used to disperse the funds accumulated and that the town had no say in the process or a property right.

Likewise, the town is not being deprived of its home rule power to levy, collect and administer local taxes (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [c] [ii] [8]) as to afford it standing since the town has never been empowered by the State to levy, collect or administer sales taxes.  In addition, the Town Supervisor, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as Town Treasurer, has no standing to demand sales tax funds or to challenge the formula for deciding the amount to be allocated. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Business Law &sect; 518, which proscribes the imposition of a credit card surcharge, is not unconstitutionally vague, indefinite or uncertain even though the term &quot;surcharge&quot; is not precisely defined by the statute since the term retains its everyday, commonsense meaning and, therefore, defendant, a gas station operator charged with attempting to impose a five-cent per gallon charge over the cash price when complainant tried to use his credit card to purchase gasoline, had fair warning as to what conduct was prohibited.  Defendant's contention that the charge for gasoline in excess of the cash price was a cash discount and not a surcharge should be raised at trial.  General Business Law &sect; 518 is not preempted by a similar surcharge prohibition contained in the Federal Truth in Lending Act (15 USC &sect; 1666f [a] [2]) since the State statute is designed to complement the Federal act and the corresponding provision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the Federal act is neither too pervasive nor dominant nor in conflict with the State statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nearly two years after the state passed a law allowing municipalities to impose fees to recover the administrative costs of rent regulation, the city passed an ordinance imposing such a fee and then amended it to make it retroactive for two years.

The court ruled in favor of the property owners and found that the ordinance was unconstitutional and violated the enabling statute. The retroactive fee violated due process because the avowed reason for the fee, which was to increase general revenues to prevent a future anticipated shortfall rather than to defray past costs, was not a proper public purpose, the attempt to recapture funds from the previous two years was inherently unreasonable, and the property owner's had an expectation that they would not be required to pay a fee for those two years. The ordinance violated equal protection because it required property owners who purchased property since the ordinance was enacted to pay the fee even though they had not been owners during that time. Finally, the ordinance violated the enabling statute because the statute only allowed for prospective fees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 1986 local law of the City of New York which assesses a $ 10 per unit annual fee on the owners of rent-stabilized multiple dwellings retroactive to April 1, 1984 (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; YY51-6.0.7 [c]) in an effort to increase the general revenues of the city to prevent a future anticipated shortfall of funds is unconstitutional as violative of due process since retrospective application unfairly frustrates the owners' expectations of prospective application in view of the city's failure to act promptly after enactment of the statute enabling it to impose such a $ 10 fee to defray the costs of administration of rent regulation (Omnibus Housing Act, L 1983, ch 403, &sect; 3, McKinney's Uncons Laws of NY &sect; 8628), the city's initial enactment in December 1985 of only a prospective annual fee and the fact that the enabling statute speaks in prospective terms.  Moreover, the attempt to recapture funds more than two years prior to the enactment of the law is inherently unreasonable.  The local law is also violative of equal protection since it discriminates&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against owners who purchased rent-stabilized multiple dwellings since December 1985 who would then be liable for fees for a period of time when they were not owners of the property.  Lastly, the local law is invalid for conflicting with its enabling legislation regarding retrospective application and the utilization of funds for purposes other than to defray the costs of rent stabilization on a year-to-year basis.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners challenged the validity of N.Y. City, N.Y., Local Law No. 22 in a case against defendant city. The ordinance provided that plaintiffs were required to meet certain guidelines in providing single room occupancy (SRO) dwellings. The court held that the provisions of the law which imposed the affirmative obligations on plaintiffs to rehabilitate all vacant SRO units and to rent them to bona fide tenants was declared invalid. Defendants were enjoined from enforcing those provisions. The court found that the regulations imposed an unreasonable and arbitrary scheme and frustrated plaintiffs' property rights without due process of law. The court did not accept that the ordinance was invalid because of inconsistency with N.Y. Mun.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local law enacted by the City of New York, which, in an effort to preserve and maintain single room occupancy (SRO) multiple dwellings as relatively inexpensive housing for persons of low and moderate incomes, the elderly and individuals suffering from some form of physical or mental disability, imposes a moratorium on the demolition of SRO buildings, imposes affirmative obligations on the owners of buildings containing SRO units to maintain the units in habitable conditions and to renovate any vacant units to make them habitable (Local Laws, 1986, No. 22 of City of New York), is unconstitutional since the provisions of the law impose an onerous and uncompensated burden on the properties regulated so as to deprive or frustrate the owners' property rights without due process of law. The local law is not unconstitutional as inconsistent with and preempted by State law since the entire field of rental accommodations is not preempted by State law and any inconsistent State laws regarding vacancy and demolition are special State laws affecting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only New York City and the City Council may enact special laws in furtherance of its police power which conflict with other special laws.  The local law does not violate the &quot;Urstadt Law&quot; (L 1971, ch 372) since that law only prohibits more stringent or restrictive local regulation of the rents that landlords could charge and does not apply to the broader regulatory scheme to preserve SRO units.  Although the notice of the public hearing on the local law was not initially published in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">City Record</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as required (Municipal Home Rule &sect; 20 [5]), the subsequent reenactment of the law following a public hearing with the requisite notice renders plaintiff's challenge to the law on this ground moot.  Since plaintiffs are not residents of the community which may be affected by the provisions of the local law and have only an economic interest, they lack standing to challenge the law for failure to comply with environmental requirements.  Accordingly, since a violation of constitutional due process rights constitutes irreparable injury, defendants are enjoined from enforcing those provisions of the local law which impose the affirmative obligations on plaintiffs to rehabilitate all vacant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SRO units and to rent them to bona fide tenants. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Attorney-General initiated a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 63(12), which alleged that respondent automobile manufacturer engaged in persistent fraudulent conduct in violation of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 198(a) (Lemon Law). The automobile manufacturer moved to dismiss the attorney general's petition, and the court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The automobile manufacturer charged its customers the first $ 100 for repairs made under its extended powertrain warranty when the vehicle's odometer had between 12,000 and 18,000 miles. The attorney general successfully sought to enjoin the practice as violative of the Lemon Law. The court noted that the legislative purpose behind the Lemon Law was to give consumers greater redress for defects in a new car than were afforded by the manufacturers' express limited warranties. The court rejected the automobile manufacturer's position that the $ 100 payment was a permissible condition precedent to the warranty. The court determined that the Lemon Law did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 as an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. The court held that the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (Act) did not preempt state laws providing a remedy to a consumer, and that any claim that the Act was a burden on interstate commerce would have to be raised in a federal court. Because the automobile manufacturer had not intentionally engaged in consumer fraud, the court held that the appropriate remedy was a prospective enforcement of the provisions of the Lemon Law as interpreted in its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the attorney general's petition which requested a permanent injunction against the automobile manufacturer. The court granted summary judgment to the attorney general and converted a portion of the proceeding to a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. General Business Law &sect; 198-a (Lemon Law) requires that during the first 18,000 miles or two years of operation, whichever occurs first, an automobile manufacturer must repair all defects covered by its express warranty free of charge. Although section 198-a (3) allows the manufacturer to attach conditions precedent to its express warranty obligation, respondent manufacturer's requirement that its customers pay the first $ 100 for warranty repair work performed between 12,000 and 18,000 miles as a condition precedent to enforcement of its obligation under its extended powertrain limited warranty is unenforceable.  As such, the petition of the Attorney-General which seeks to permanently enjoin respondent from requiring its customers to pay the $ 100 service charge for obtaining warranty repair work on the automobile's powertrain is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Commerce Clause -- &quot;Lemon Law&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. General Business Law &sect; 198-a (Lemon Law) does not impose an unreasonable burden upon the flow of interstate commerce in violation of the United States Constitution (art I, &sect; 8).  It does not directly regulate or discriminate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  against interstate commerce. Nor does it favor New York residents or businesses at the expense of sister States.  Although it may be advisable for the Federal Government to establish one uniform law, in its stead, the State may act to protect its consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Federal Preemption -- &quot;Lemon Law&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the Magnuson-Moss Act (15 USC &sect;&sect; 2301-2312), which requires a manufacturer to fully disclose the terms of a warranty it is voluntarily giving, does prohibit a State law that would regulate the contents of or performance under a written warranty complying with the disclosure requirements of the Federal act, it does not preempt or prevent the enactment of a State law which provides a remedy to a consumer. Accordingly, since General Business Law &sect; 198-a (Lemon Law) does not require that respondent manufacturer make any disclosure in its warranty booklet but merely provides an additional remedy to State consumers, it is not preempted by the Magnuson-Moss Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Consumer Protection -- Deceptive Acts and Practices -- Remedies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Since respondent manufacturer has not intentionally engaged in consumer fraud by requiring that its customers pay a $ 100 service&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  charge for warranty repair work in violation of General Business Law &sect; 198-a (Lemon Law), an award of $ 2,000 in statutory costs to petitioner is not appropriate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, CPLR 8303 [a] [6]).  Likewise, retroactive reimbursement to the consumers that have paid the $ 100 charge is not appropriate.  Requiring respondent to locate and repay such consumers would be at a cost ultimately to be borne by future new car purchasers. Prospective enforcement of the provisions of General Business Law &sect; 198-a will best serve the interest of all New York consumers. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he should have been granted a single judge, nonpublic trial apart from his &quot;adult&quot; codefendants. The State contended that he was entitled to mandatory youth offender status because he was before a superior court. The court reasoned that courts which had found constitutional the statutory classification of youths who were required to receive the youthful offender benefit did so on the basis of the rationality of a distinction grounded on the gravity of the crime originally charged in an accusatory instrument. The court concluded that the rational basis so found did not exist in this case. The court held that defendant had never been charged with a felony, there was therefore no preliminary investigation basis and no probable cause for a belief that defendant's activities were felonious. The court reasoned that there had never been a serious crime charged. The court concluded that the only distinction between defendant and those accused misdemeanants for whom youthful offender treatment was mandatory was the forum in which the charge was pending. Therefore, the court held that there was no basis, rational or otherwise, for treating defendant differently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Youthful Offenders -- Mandatory Treatment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's youthful offender statutes deny defendant equal protection of law and are thus unconstitutional as applied to him to the extent that defendant, an otherwise eligible youth charged in an indictment with a class A misdemeanor of assault in the third degree who would be entitled to mandatory youthful offender treatment if his case were pending in a local criminal court ( CPL 720.20 [1] [b]), is only eligible for discretionary youthful offender treatment solely because the prosecution is proceeding by way of indictment in a superior court rather than by information ( CPL 720.20 [1] [a]).  While the seriousness of the original charge and interests of judicial economy provide rational bases for different classifications for youthful offender treatment, unfettered prosecutorial discretion does not provide a rational basis to treat defendant differently than other youths &quot;similarly situated&quot;.  Defendant is in that classification of persons for whom youthful offender treatment is mandatory based on the gravity of the charge originally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  brought and he is thus entitled to mandatory youthful offender treatment even though his case is pending in a superior court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants participated in a demonstration at a public park, where they removed their shirts and uncovered their chests to protest what they viewed as sexist and repressive laws which permitted men, but not women, to appear with bare chests in public places. Defendants contend that the differential treatment of men's and women's breasts constituted sex discrimination in violation of equal protection of the laws. The court held that although the State could not regulate private conduct, it could enforce standards as to public conduct, where, as here, a fundamental right was not involved. Defendants further contended that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to their conduct because they were engaged in expressive conduct. The court agreed, holding that expressive conduct was entitled to the protective shield of the First Amendment. The court reasoned that defendants' conduct was intended to convey a very particularized message and was overwhelmingly imbued with communicative elements. The court reasoned that defendants conduct did not foreclose the use of the park, was not a repeated occurrence, and did not frustrate the purpose of the penal statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 245.01, which imposes criminal sanctions on women for exposing their breasts below the top of the areola in a public place, is constitutional since community standards regard the female breast, and not the male breast, as an intimate part of the human body and the statute's gender distinction is substantially related to the legitimate governmental objective of protecting the public from invasions of its sensibilities. The statute's objective merely reflects current community standards as to what constitutes nudity and is not improperly based on stereotyped notions of the female breasts as objects for sexual pleasure nor does the right to control one's personal appearance encompass a fundamental right to appear nude in public.  Defendants, who removed their shirts and uncovered their breasts in a public park within the City of Rochester to protest what they view as sexist and repressive laws which permit men, but not women, to appear with bare chests in public, have no standing to challenge the statute as being void for vagueness since their conduct was clearly proscribed by the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, the statute is unconstitutional as applied to defendants' conduct in the circumstances of this case since they were engaged in constitutionally protected expressive conduct in that, not only was the removal of their shirts intended to convey a very particularized message about women's control over their own bodies and about the sexism of gender-specific public exposure laws, but there was also a great likelihood that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.  Defendants' conduct did not frustrate the objective of the statute since the demonstration was a one-time occurrence that was carried out in a secluded part of the park so as not to offend or surprise anyone.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that rather than the one-year limitations period contained in &sect; 3813(2-b), his action was subject to the six-year limitations period applicable to contract actions.

The court explained that in order to pass constitutional muster, legislation retroactively shortening a period of limitations had to provide a party with a reasonable time to commence an action. Reviewing the date of accrual of plaintiff's cause of action, the court noted that his action would have been immediately barred upon the effective date of the one-year limitations contained in &sect; 3813(2-b) and as such, opined that the application of &sect; 3813(2-b) to plaintiff's action would be unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax assessor was elected to his office by a township. However, he failed to comply with the certification requirements for knowledge and skills required under N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 310 within a year after his election. Approximately two years after his election, the Board held a hearing to determine whether he had complied with the training requirements under N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 310(10) and N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, pt. 188. The hearing officer held that the tax assessor had not met the requirements and recommended that the Board declare that his office was vacant. The Board accepted the finding and the recommendation. As such, the tax assessor filed his action to declare that the statutory requirements were unconstitutional. The court held that N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 310(5) and (10) and N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, pt. 188 were not unconstitutional because the qualifications for the office of assessor established under N.Y. Real Prop.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPTL 310 (5) and (10) and the regulations enacted thereunder ( 9 NYCRR part 188), pursuant to which the State Board of Equalization and Assessment may, after a hearing, declare vacant the office of an assessor elected after November 1, 1982, who is not certified as having met the prescribed educational and training requirements within one year following the commencement of his term, are constitutional.  When the Legislature establishes a public office, it may prescribe qualifications for holding that office as long as the qualifications have a rational basis. Since an assessor plays a pivotal role in the taxation process, it is imperative that he be familiar with the various assessment theories and procedures and, thus, the qualifications for the office of assessor established in RPTL 310 have a rational basis. </SPAN></P>

Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 390. The court dismissed the information and held that defendant could not be convicted of violating the ordinance because a family day care home was a permitted use of residentially zoned property in view of the state's public policy favoring home day care. An ordinance prohibiting use of residentially zoned single-family dwellings for day care had no reasonable or substantial relation to the public health, welfare, and safety of the people of the town and could thwart state interest.

The court first found that the use of a simplified information to charge defendant under N.Y. Transp. Law &sect; 14-F was sufficient. The court then noted that the legislative enactment, which was presumed to be valid, was constitutional because N.Y. Const. art III, &sect; 16 applied to statutes and not to rules and regulations. The court further pointed out that the statutory framework of the transportation law was clear and left no discretion for arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant truck driver filed a motion to dismiss the simplified information filed against him by the state for his violations of N.Y. Transp. Law &sect; 14-F. He argued that the information was legally insufficient and that the statute, which regulated transportation of hazardous materials, violated the state constitution in several respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged a truck driver with violating N.Y. Transp. Law &sect; 14-f. The truck driver's motion to dismiss argued that the simplified informations were insufficient; it also argued that the statute was preempted by federal law and violated the state constitution. The court, noting that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 100.10(2)(a) permitted simplified informations for traffic infractions and misdemeanors, summarily held that the informations were sufficient. The court cited the Federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1801 et seq., which by its terms preempted inconsistent state laws. The Act provided the basis for N.Y. Transp. Law &sect; 14-f, which solved the preemption issue by incorporating the federal regulations, and by requiring the state's transportation commissioner to make rules no less protective of public safety than those of the federal act. Incorporation of the federal act by reference did not violate N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. The authority to make administrative rules did not contravene N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; I . The rules became effective when they were published, under N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 and N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 102. The motion to dismiss was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner school filed a summary proceeding against respondents, city and building operator, to be restored to possession of the space it formerly utilized in a building owned by the city and operated by a contractor of the Human Resources Agency (HRA) under the federal neighborhood facilities program. The city had changed the locks and filed a plenary trespass action against the school as a result of nonpayment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the school's occupancy agreement expired, the city and the building operator allowed it to remain in the building as a holdover tenant. However, when the school was late in paying its rent, the city locked the school out of the building. The court held that the city's self-help measure of locking out the school constituted an illegal forcible entry and detainer. There was no justification for it either in fact or law. The city's action deprived the school of its licensee rights unilaterally without resort to legal process. The city could have instituted a holdover proceeding based on the expiration of the occupancy agreement and its asserted claim of illegality. It could have had the building operator use the stipulation in the nonpay summary proceeding and the school's default under it to obtain a warrant of eviction. Thus, in the absence of an extraordinary situation, the city's self-help eviction of the school without judicial sanction of any substantial property interest was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The City of New York, as landlord, illegally locked petitioner out of a city-owned building rather than resort to any of several legal processes available to it; the city could have instituted a holdover proceeding based on the expiration of the occupancy agreement and its asserted claim of illegality, or it could have used a stipulation in a prior nonpayment proceeding and petitioner's default thereunder to obtain a warrant of eviction. Petitioner, which had occupied the premises for 2 1/2 years, was at least a licensee which had the right to run a school on the premises and the city's action deprived petitioner of its rights without resort to due process; the fact that petitioner may have no defense to the city's claims does not justify the self-help employed by the city.  Moreover, Real Property Law &sect; 231 (1), which permits a landlord to use self-help if a tenant is using the premises for illegal purposes, should not be used in situations not involving Penal Law violations directly related to the premises such as prostitution, gambling or narcotics, or in the absence of urgent need; and the illegalities alleged, i.e., &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  petitioner's failure to secure various bureaucratic imprimaturs, do not justify precipitous action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Landlord and Tenant -- Wrongful Eviction -- Remedy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although a landlord acted illegally in locking out petitioner from the premises it had occupied, that does not mean that possession of the premises must be returned to petitioner, who was at best a licensee whose alleged written right to use the premises had expired, thereby terminating whatever holdover rights it might have enjoyed, since a court need not order a wrongfully evicted party back to possession where the return would be futile; it makes no sense to restore petitioner to possession only to order its eviction in the near future.  Accordingly, inasmuch as the landlord's forcible entry and detainer remain, the matter shall be restored to the calendar for a hearing on petitioner's damages.  </SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that no fact finder could reasonably infer dominion or control over the trunk and its contents by any of the defendants. To prove a criminal possession of a weapon charge there must first be evidence of possession, whether actual or constructive, personal or accessorial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence that the recent occupants of a rented car knew that a gun was in the locked trunk and planned to use it in an armed robbery does not provide the necessary connection between defendants and the weapon that is necessary to demonstrate dominion and control over the weapon so as to sustain a charge of criminal possession of a weapon where neither the trunk nor the ignition key was recovered and there is no evidence whatever that any of the three defendants had access to the trunk. In order to sustain a constructive possession charge through dominion and control, there must be clear evidence of the defendant's direct access to and/or control over the contraband at that point when possession is alleged and, in the absence of any evidence that the gun recovered from the locked trunk was imminently available, there is no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the three defendants exercised dominion and control over&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the weapon. It is irrelevant that the Grand Jury was not instructed with regard to Penal Law &sect; 265.15 (3), which provides that a gun recovered from an automobile is presumptive evidence of its possession by all persons occupying the vehicle at the time the weapon is found since it is for the fact finder to determine whether the simultaneous presence of the defendant and the gun in the car, together with any other relevant evidence, signifies constructive possession beyond a reasonable doubt.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers, individually and as representatives of an alleged class, brought a suit against defendants, a town and others, for a declaratory judgment to obtain a refund of a school tax that they had paid based on unconstitutional legislation. The court granted the town's motion to dismiss the case. The town then sought a declaratory judgment that it did not need to refund the taxes. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A levy statute employed by the town was found to be unconstitutional in an underlying suit. The town subsequently passed another curative piece of legislation. After the school taxes were levied the curative legislation was also found to be unconstitutional. The town had adopted a dual rate tax structure, which resulted in the taxpayers bearing a higher proportion of the school tax burden than did similarly situated owners of residential properties based on geographic location. This violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions. The court denied the town's motion to dismiss the suit but found that the taxpayers were not entitled to a refund. Even though the taxes under N.Y. Real. Prop. Tax Law art. 19-A were declared unconstitutional, that conclusion did not require a tax refund to the taxpayers. No refund was necessary where the time frame between the two pieces of legislation was a matter of months, such that little else could be done; the legislature had a good faith belief the statute would be found to be constitutional; the taxing unit relied upon the derived revenues; an undue burden would be imposed on the taxing unit; and no fraud was present.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the town's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, denied the school district's motion for summary judgment for failure of the complaint to state a claim, granted the taxpayers' motion to declare the school tax levy unconstitutional, and granted the school district's motion to declare that a tax refund was not obligatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding, petitioners, a seller and a buyer of property, sought in the alternative, to annul the denial by respondent Town Board of the Town of Vestal (New York) of an application for a special permit pursuant to an ordinance and for an order granting the permit, or for remand to the Town Board for continuation of an earlier public hearing with full participation by petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A buyer applied for a required special permit and submitted a statement of landowners in support of the application at the public hearing, as required by Vestal, N.Y., Town of Vestal Zoning Code &sect; 44-XI-10. At that hearing the sufficiency of the number of the signatory landowners was raised. The issue was then shelved for another meeting until the issue of the signatures could be resolved. The number of proper signatures was determined by counting owners of contiguous pieces of land only once. The buyer was told that the issue would not be raised at the next meeting so he did not attend. The issue was discussed and the application was denied. The court held that the counting of the signatures was improper. The court found that the consent provision of &sect; 44-XI-10 required the buyer, as an applicant, to submit to the Town Board approval statements from the owners of 50% of real property within 500 feet of the subject premises to satisfy the condition precedent of the Zoning Code, such percentage to be determined in land area terms, rather than number of owners. The court retained jurisdiction over the other contested issues until the application's validity could be determined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the action to the Town Board for a determination to be made within 45 days after entry of this order as to whether approval from the owners of 50 percent of the land area within 500 feet of the subject property were received for the public hearing, and whether it had received such approvals as of the other dates.

However, the interpretation of the town affording a single vote to the owner of each parcel which is separately assessed on the tax map and treating contiguous parcels with the same owner as a single unified parcel entitling that owner to a single vote but granting a single owner of noncontiguous parcels within the concerned land area a vote for each noncontiguous parcel is improper since such a one-man, one-vote doctrine disfavors owners of large single parcels as well as contiguous parcels in the counting process while favoring owners of small or noncontiguous parcels and conflicts with the purpose of the consent provision of protecting surrounding properties and is contrary to the &quot;fundamental rule that zoning deals basically with land use and not with the person who owns or occupies&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it&quot;.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner and two other prisoners attempted to escape while being transported. One officer and one prisoner died in the attempt. Petitioner contended that his judgment of conviction was illegal and a nullity because the indictment failed to allege a cognizable crime under the law in effect at the time. The court disagreed. The court found that the provisions of the New York Penal Law, which enumerated crimes, had to be construed according to the fair import of their terms to promote justice and effect the objects of the law. Even though the laws prior to petitioner's conviction classified an attempted escape as a class A misdemeanor rather than a felony, such attempt could serve as a predicate &quot;felony&quot; for purposes of applying the felony murder statute for petitioner's crime. Nowhere under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25 (1965), the revised murder statute, did the statute indicate that the predicate for murder had to be a felony. An attempted escape from custody was such an inherently dangerous act, not only to the escapee but to his captors and the public in general, that the crime properly and constitutionally might serve as a predicate for the crime of murder under &sect; 125.25 (3).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner was lawfully convicted of &quot;felony&quot; murder (Penal Law &sect; 125.25 [3]) in 1975 for his involvement along with two other prisoners in the death of a Deputy Sheriff during an attempted escape in 1968 even though, at the time of petitioner's crime, attempted escape in the second degree was a class A misdemeanor (Penal Law &sect; 110.05), since attempted escape from custody is such an inherently dangerous act not only to the escapee but to his captors and the public in general that such properly and constitutionally may serve as a predicate for the crime of &quot;felony&quot; murder. The inclusion of attempted escape in the second degree as a specifically enumerated predicate to the &quot;felony&quot; murder statute cannot be disregarded as an inadvertent drafting mistake since, historically, it has been the underlying conduct involved in the substantive crime and not its classification as a misdemeanor and/or felony which serves a predicate for operation of the murder statute. If a mistake was made, it was in the Legislature's failure to remember that under the revised Penal Law of 1967 all attempts at felonies were not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  necessarily &quot;felonies&quot; as they had been in the past and not in the inclusion of attempted escape as a predicate crime of potential violence justifying a &quot;felony&quot; murder charge.  Since petitioner is incarcerated in a correctional facility in Westchester County, the writ of habeas corpus is properly brought in Westchester County ( CPLR 7002 [b]) rather than in Ulster County where petitioner's trial was held.  </SPAN></P>

The statute is not unconstitutionally &quot;sex-based&quot; since a male petitioner who is found to be the father may apply for an award of counsel fees against a respondent mother, and whether a counsel fee award should be available to a respondent who defeats an application for an order of filiation is a matter for the Legislature; further, the statute mandates that a party's ability to pay be considered on an application for counsel fees.

Although surrogate parenting was not contemplated when the Legislature enacted Social Services Law &sect; 374 (6) prohibiting payments in connection with an adoption, current legislation does not expressly foreclose the use of surrogate mothers or the paying of compensation to them under parenting agreements, and as with any contractual arrangement, the court will determine whether there has been any overreaching, unfair advantage, fraud, undue influence, or excessive payments.  It is for the Legislature to determine whether statutory provisions should be enacted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to allow or disallow such payments and the practice of surrogate parenting.

The court continued and held that since the revocation of bail could only last until there were no felony charges or class A or violent felony charges against defendant, such revocation could not exist at all since no such charges were ever made.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants filed a grandfathering application after the Loft Law was passed to provide legalization of lofts as dwellings. Their application was rejected as untimely. They sought an order compelling the planning commission to accept and approve their application. The court determined that the deadlines for filing the application were not properly adopted and directed the planning commission to accept the application as timely filed. The notice published by the planning commission prior to adoption of the resolution did not meet the 10-day publication requirement as the 10th publication was made on the day of the hearing and, by definition, was not published prior to the date of the hearing. Further, the notice itself was insufficient because it contained typographical errors and there were omissions. In addition, under the Loft Law the burden of filing applications designed to legalize loft residence was on the landlord and not the tenants. As such, the tenants were not adequately notified that under the proposed zoning amendments they were required to take affirmative steps to obtain rights that they thought had been guaranteed under the Loft Law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was a paternity action between petitioner mother and respondent deceased father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The paternity action was brought after the birth of the child and more than two months after the death of the putative father. The mother and putative father were not married. The court found that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 518, which seemingly required the paternity petition to abate on the death of the putative father, was violative of equal protection because it did not provide that a paternity petition would abate on the death of the mother. Determining that the legislature would prefer a gender-neutral interpretation of the statute rather than to strike it in its entirety, the court held that consistent with N.Y. Stat. Law &sect; 150(c), &sect; 518 should be read to give it constitutional validity. The court's gender neutral reading of &sect; 518 thus defeated abatement and a finding of paternity was made based on clear and convincing evidence, which included the mother's testimony respecting the inception, duration, and frequency of her exclusive sexual relationship with the putative father, his actions and positive comments made during her pregnancy, and the testimony by the putative father's sister that he told her that he was the father of the mother's unborn child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the action for paternity could be brought notwithstanding the death of the putative father prior to the action's commencement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family Court Act &sect; 518, which provides that the right to bring a paternity proceeding does not abate if the mother dies, thereby compelling the conclusion under rules of statutory construction that the Legislature intended to preclude the survival of paternity actions after the death of the father, must be read in a gender-neutral way so as to include fathers in order to save the statute from being violative of equal protection since the gender-based classification is not substantially related to achieving the important governmental objective of the statute to accord equal treatment to marital and nonmarital children by expanding the opportunity to obtain orders of filiation. The statute should be read to extend the benefits to the previously disfavored class of fathers rather than being struck down in its entirety since the Legislature, had it foreseen the court's conclusion as to underinclusiveness, would have opted for a gender-neutral statute in view of the unremitting expansion of the rights of nonmarital children.

The doctrine of law of the case does not preclude the New York State Supreme Court from determining whether it has subject matter jurisdiction of a proceeding to determine whether the State of New York or the Federal Government is entitled to the unclaimed Federal income tax refunds of New York State residents, despite a prior decision in the matter by the United States District Court, which, upon a motion by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to remove the case to Federal court and to dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity, held that there was no Federal jurisdiction because the Secretary of the Treasury was no more than a stakeholder with no claim of right to the funds in question, and remanded the matter to State court.  In deciding that the State court should retain jurisdiction, the Federal Judge necessarily decided that the United States was amenable to suit brought by the State in the State court.  Nevertheless, the Federal court decision was not subject to appeal and, thus, whether or not that decision was ill-considered, made on the basis of an incomplete record or was in error, the State court will make its own determination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as to whether it has subject matter jurisdiction with respect to unclaimed Federal tax refunds.</SPAN></P>

Although there is no Federal right of escheat, even as to abandoned property in the hands of the Federal Government, the Federal Government may act pursuant to US Constitution article VI to defeat State escheat statutes, but the Government has not acted affirmatively to prevent the escheat of Federal tax refunds. Further, since entitlement to the refunds has been determined and the funds are held custodially by the United States pending transfer to the beneficial owner, the United States is a mere stakeholder whose immunity from suit without its consent is not an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue and the State can make the definitive determination as to the devolution of title to the funds; moreover, the State, in asserting the right of escheat, stands in the shoes of the rightful claimants, and is entitled to reclaim the funds as abandoned property.</SPAN></P>

A State seeking escheat of abandoned claims for refunds need not itself file a claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service -- such a claim has already been determined.  Further, even if the Government becomes entitled to subsequently arising offsets against the refunds, they can be handled administratively on an individual basis, and would not bar an adjudication of title to the refunds. Moreover, the State has stipulated that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  it will reimburse the Government for any moneys paid over by the Government to taxpayers who claim their refunds after the Government has turned over the unclaimed tax refunds to the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church, offering a lot of land for sale, entered into a contract with the buyer, and when the church petitioned for leave to sell the property pursuant to N.Y. Relig. Corp. law &sect; 12 and N.Y. Not-for-Profit Corp. Law &sect; 511, the court's independent appraiser determined the fair market value was 80 percent over the contract price.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police union filed an action in the Supreme Court of New York, New York County, against defendants, the police commissioner, police department (Department) and the city (referred to collectively as defendants), in which the union sought a determination that an interim Department order which required random drug testing for police officers assigned to a certain bureau was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department order at issue required current and future members of the Department's Organized Crime Control Bureau (OCCB) to consent and submit to future random drug testing. Previously, all Department members were subject to testing where there was a &quot;reasonable belief&quot; that the suspect officer was using drugs. The union objected only to the proposed order, which eliminated the &quot;reasonable belief&quot; requirement for OCCB members. The union claimed the proposed order violated OCCB members' constitutional rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court found the intrusive drug tests constituted Fourth Amendment searches, and found the Department failed to demonstrate or to document that drug use presented a discernible problem or danger sufficient to warrant the constitutional intrusion occasioned by standardless drug testing of the approximately 1,200 members of the OCCB. Thus, because the proposed order failed to meet the requirements of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, the court found the proposed order unconstitutional. The court provided, however, that defendants could have continued to test officers upon a reasonable suspicion basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the Department's drug testing order violated the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches because the random and standardless searches of certain union members was not justified.</SPAN></P>

The statute is constitutional since there is a valid societal purpose to be served in allowing the conviction of an offender under the age of 21 for violation of a statute designed to protect persons under the age of 21 and it is not unconstitutional to punish minors under a statute designed to protect them since society can legally and constitutionally &quot;protect&quot; minors against themselves by penal legislation.

Defendant contended that it was unconstitutional to refer his pretrial motion to suppress to a judicial hearing officer. He also asserted that there was no probable cause for his arrest. The court held, as a matter of law, that the applicable statutes regarding the position of judicial hearing officer were constitutional. The court affirmed the report of the judicial judge and denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the statute creating the position of judicial hearing officer did not violate any provisions of the New York State Constitution, such that the State legislature could, by statute, provide for references by judges to judicial hearing officers in some cases; (2) the arresting officer could apprehend defendant based upon a radio transmission from an undercover member of the police force where probable cause existed for the arrest; and (3) probable cause was determined from, inter alia, the specific description of the suspect given in the transmission; the officer's experience, training, and expertise; and the circumstances of the time and place.</SPAN></P>

The corporation claimed that a state program unconstitutionally allowed tax amnesty for those not under investigation or indictment for tax violations but did not allow it for those under investigation or indictment.

Since, in respect to revenue raising, the Legislature did all that was necessary to induce the disclosure of previous nonpayments and since that purpose is legitimate and the means were reasonably tailored to suit the purpose, the Legislature was not required to do more and, thus, the statutory classification of those eligible for amnesty is not underinclusive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A zoning ordinance of the Town of Rhinebeck which prohibits the movement of any building without a building permit is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendants' prosecution for moving a &quot;caboose&quot; onto their premises for use as an office without a permit since the definition of &quot;building&quot; in the ordinance includes wheeled units such as a &quot;dining car&quot;, &quot;mobile home&quot;, &quot;lunch wagon&quot; or &quot;similar structure&quot; and, thus, provides reasonable notice that a &quot;caboose&quot; would require a permit.  Likewise, the fact that the ordinance does not expressly prohibit the erection of a &quot;caboose&quot; on real property does not prevent defendants' prosecution for violating the ordinance since a &quot;caboose&quot; is clearly a type of wheeled unit that falls within the ambit of the concept of a structure and/or building.  Defendants are not entitled to a jury trial in the misdemeanor zoning case in view of the six-month limitation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of jail time and a maximum $ 1,000 fine. However, since an automatic stay &quot;of all proceedings&quot; was in effect from July 25, 1985 when defendants filed an appeal of the denial of a permit with the town code enforcement officer and the Zoning Board of Appeals until November 18, 1985 when the Board's decision was filed with the town clerk (Town Law &sect; 267 [4]), defendants cannot be charged with violating the ordinance during that time period but the information alleging a violation on July 10, 1985 is valid.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that if the employee felt aggrieved by a member of the board, his proper remedy was to approach the board and seek its support. If he was not successful, then his position became untenable since he was required to serve at the board's pleasure. The court held that to go outside the board and seek redress in the courts could constitute a form of coercion to intimidate a board member and restrain him from performing his duties.

The indictment was dismissed and the sentence vacated. He was then resentenced on the sodomy conviction as a first felony offender. Petitioner requested that the time for which he was incarcerated as a result of the dismissed robbery charge be credited against the prison term he was serving on the sodomy conviction.

There was no sentence left to be imposed on the first charge on which he would have been entitled to a credit but for the dismissal of the charge.

Petitioner's proceeding to annul a determination of the State Department of Correctional Services denying his application pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.30 (3) for a sentence credit for time served on the robbery conviction against his sentence for the sodomy conviction should be dismissed, since that statute contemplates a situation in which a party has been in custody due to a charge but has not yet been convicted or sentenced on that charge when a second charge is lodged against him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord sought to evict defendant surviving &quot;gay life partner&quot; of decedent on the basis that decedent was the only named tenant on the lease.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant surviving &quot;gay life partner&quot; argued he was entitled to a renewal lease or a vacancy lease based on recent interpretation of the Rent Stabilization Law, N.Y., Admin. Code. &sect; YY51-1.0 et seq. Because the decedent was the only named tenant on the lease, plaintiff landlord sought to evict defendant. The court granted summary judgment to plaintiff. Defendant later moved to renew and reargued the decision on the basis of a subsequent Emergency Operational Bulletin issued by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which stated that a host of relatives living in the house were deemed to be family members and gave vacancy lease rights to those relatives. The court granted defendant's motion, holding that a gay life partner had the same right as a family member to a vacancy lease under &sect; YY51-1.0 et seq. and that defendant was entitled to remain in the apartment. The court held that there was no rational reason for separate classification of defendant. Exclusion of defendant, who had provided care and love to decedent through illness and death, as a family member, would be an arbitrary way to define family. The court denied summary judgment to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant had the same right as a family member to a vacancy lease under the Rent Stabilization Law and was therefore entitled to remain in the apartment. Plaintiff landlord's summary judgment motion was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sponsor filed an action against respondent zoning board in the Supreme Court for Schenectady County (New York), after the zoning board requested that the sponsor file a draft environmental impact report pertaining to its motorcycle fair and exposition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sponsor claimed the requirement was imposed to hinder the sponsor's ability to obtain a permit. The court pointed out that 6 N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 617.2 gave the zoning board the authority to act as the lead agency. The court also noted that the Town Environmental Quality Ordinance was not overbroad because it was specifically qualified to remain consistent with 6 N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 617. The sponsor also contended that its fair was a Type II list, which did not require an environmental review at all because it was a minor temporary use of the land having negligible or no permanent effect on the environment. The court rejected this argument and pointed out that a temporary use was not necessarily minor. The court also agreed that the zoning board identified the relevant areas of concern and took a &quot;hard look&quot; at them and made a &quot;reasoned elaboration&quot; of the basis for its determination. The court also found no support in the record that the zoning board had acted in bad faith or was guilty of a conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the zoning board's motion to dismiss the sponsor's petition to prohibit the zoning board from requiring the sponsor to prepare and submit an environmental impact statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Town of Duanesburg Zoning Board of Appeals properly designated itself as the lead agency to undertake environmental review of petitioner's project even though the town environmental quality review ordinance provides that responsibility &quot;for environmental review * * * shall be designated to the appropriate * * * boards by resolution of the Town Board&quot; since town ordinance is contrary to the State Environmental Quality Review Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder which authorize the lead agency designation without action by the Town Board (6 NYCRR 617.2 [r]).  Petitioner's plan to hold a fair and exposition for motorcycle enthusiasts is not exempt from environmental review as a minor temporary use of land &quot;having negligible or no permanent effect on the environment&quot; (6 NYCRR 617.13 [d] [19]) since a three-day event which concentrates as many as 10,000 participants onto a 115-acre site within a town of only 5,000 cannot be classified as minor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonprofit hospital brought an action against defendant, the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York, challenging the constitutionality of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-a(9), which provided for the creation of a statewide bad debt and charity care pool funded by an assessment upon the actual Medicare revenues realized by hospitals in New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 2807-a(9), assessed monies were distributed to fund certain hospitals' losses for bad debt and charity care. The court held that &sect; 2807-a(9) conflicted with Medicare legislation in two ways. First, Medicare payments were already adjusted for certain disproportionate share hospitals, in effect making provision for their bad debt and charity care problems. Thus the state legislation frustrated the clear intent of Congress to deal with the problem by its own scheme of allocation of Medicare revenues. Secondly, Medicare legislation, specifically 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1395x(v)(1)(A) and 42 C.F.R. &sect; 405.420(d), explicitly provided that there would be no cross subsidization in determining reasonable cost. This goal was frustrated by N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2807-a(9), which redirected Medicare revenues to service bad debt and charity care revenue shortfall created by non-Medicare patients. Thus, the subject legislation was constitutionally infirm. The court awarded attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, because there was a presumption that the prevailing party should ordinarily recover such fee and there were no special circumstances which militated against such an award.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Health Law &sect; 2807-a (9), which provides for the creation of a Statewide bad debt and charity care pool funded by an assessment upon the actual Medicare revenues which are realized by the hospitals in the State, is constitutionally infirm since the State plan is preempted by the comprehensive Federal scheme of allocation of Medicare revenues which deals with bad debt and charity care problems by providing for exceptions and adjustments to the reimbursement rates &quot;to take into account the special needs * * * of public and other hospitals that serve a significantly disproportionate number of patients who have low income or are entitled to benefits under part A of this title&quot; (42 USC &sect; 1395ww [d] [5] [C] [i]).  In addition, even if the Medicare legislation does not preempt the State's power to reallocate Medicare revenues for bad debt and charity care purposes, the State plan totally frustrates the Federal goal that there be no cross subsidization in determining reasonable cost (42 USC &sect; 1395x [v] [1] [A]; 42 CFR 405.420 [d]) by redirecting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a percentage of Medicare revenues to service the bad debt and charity care revenue shortfall created, to a large extent, by non-Medicare patients. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the conclusion of trial, defendant, a registered nurse, made a motion for a dismissal of the two-count indictment by which she was charged with willful violation of health laws, in violation of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A search for missing money led defendant to force a patient to submit to a search, with a security officer banging a chair down in front of the patient and restraining him. Five minutes after the security officer and defendant left, the patient was found collapsed onto a chair and gasping for breath. Noting this, and the resuscitative efforts, defendant wholly failed to mention in the medical records the preceding incident. In her motion to dismiss the indictment, defendant argued that such incidents were commonplace and inevitable, and further that such searches frequently occurred. Nevertheless, the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss and held that the state had proven facts sufficient to show that defendant knowingly violated, inter alia, the Patients' Bill of Rights, N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2803-d(7), by searching an 86-year old man, over his objections, and omitting the search from the records. Moreover, the court held that wilful violations included those consciously and deliberately done and did not require the element of malice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants and co-defendant, three off-duty police officers, arrested a civilian for assault following a physical confrontation. Statements were made by defendants and co-defendant that no shots were fired, even though witnesses reported hearing gunshots. It was not until co-defendant submitted his weapons fire report that the police department was told that co-defendant had fired a gun. The court granted in part the motion to suppress certain statements. The court found, inter alia, that (1) oral statements made on the way to a hospital prior to the weapons report were not suppressible because all the parties were free to leave and could not have reasonably believed themselves in custody or the target of an investigation, such that Miranda warnings were required; (2) the written police forms prepared at the precinct and submitted prior to the administration of constitutional warnings were not suppressible because they were part of standard police procedure; and (3) the audiotaped statements defendants made following the constitutional and statutory warnings were suppressed because the statements were involuntary where they were procured pursuant to a grant of immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought dismissal of an action charging defendant with public display of offensive sexual material under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Charges were pending against defendant for a public display of offensive sexual material under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.11. The state sought to dismiss the charges, but its motion was opposed by an organization for decency. That group contended that pictures subject to public display were sexually explicit and violative of the statute prohibiting the unrestricted public display of sexually offensive material as defined in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.10. Defendant contended the information was defective. The court did not agree with defendant, as every defect in an accusatory instrument was not jurisdictional. Insufficiency in factual allegations was not deemed a jurisdictional defect. While the state claimed that the disputed material did not, as a matter of law, predominately appeal to prurient interest in sex, the court disagreed. As the court concluded that it could not say, as a matter of law, that the exhibit in issue did not appeal to prurient interests, it denied the motion to dismiss the charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The display in a suburban mall &quot;toy store&quot; of glossy technicolor cards featuring close-up nude shots of rear views of females, fetchingly posed with messages inside some of the cards, does not, as a matter of law, constitute the unlawful display of sexually offensive material in a place accessible to members of the public (Penal Law &sect; 245.11), the purpose of the statute being to protect minors and other members of the public against viewing pornography which might be thrust upon them indiscriminately in public places, since the determination of the Court of Appeals that the display of a life-size photograph of a nude female in a prone position with her buttocks exposed and clearly visible outside of a movie theatre in the center of Broadway does not fall within the proscription of the statute as a matter of law </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Lou Bern Broadway</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 32 NY2d 816) compels a like ruling that the display of cards merely depicting rear &quot;nudity&quot; falls outside the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proscription of the statute.  While the statute may be viewed as a public display restriction on sexually explicit nonobscene materials that need not be analyzed within the framework of conventional obscenity criteria, the court cannot rewrite the statute to incorporate local community standards or ignore the sweeping authoritative language of the Court of Appeals and a more tightly drawn statute incorporating defined &quot;harmful to minors&quot; criteria with enumerated &quot;alternative adult access&quot; would be desirable.  However, a card which depicts a man fondling the bare buttocks of a female is erotic, and since it cannot be said as a matter of law that this card does not appeal to prurient interest, the charge is not dismissed as to this card. </SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendants' argument that the indictment failed to state a crime, noting that &sect; 165.07 did criminalize unlawful use of criminal software. The court found that a &quot;computer program&quot; was included within the definition of secret scientific material under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that the New York State Department of Transportation rules and regulations promulgated under the two statutory amendments went considerably further than the statutes themselves, without legal authority. In denying the petition, the court stated that a strong presumption existed in favor of the constitutionality of the legislative enactment. It was incumbent upon the petitioners to rebut the constitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. There was a wholly rational and reasonable basis for the legislation. 1985 N.Y. Laws chs. 549, 929 carefully regulated the maximum gross weight of trucks allowed to travel the roads and bridges of the State and allowed for varying weights, depending on the wheel configurations, length of the truck and geographic area in which the truck will travel. Greater weights were allowed in the &quot;downstate&quot; area because restrictive weight limitations caused a disproportionately greater increase in travel time and construction costs downstate due to the greater traffic congestion in that area.

The prison official sought to dismiss the petition on the grounds that the petition was time-barred, the inmate failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and the petition failed to state a cause of action. The court found that the contention that the action was time-barred was without merit. The inmate challenged the prison official's ability to appoint parole officers to the release committees rather than the denial of her application to participate in the temporary release program. Accordingly, the six-year statute of limitations of N.Y. C.P.L.R. 213(1) applied and the action was timely. Moreover, because the inmate's claim was a constitutional challenge, she could maintain the action without first exhausting administrative remedies. The court held that N.Y. Comp.

In the second case, city police affixed to the individual's legally parked vehicle two parking violation summonses charging that the car was uninspected and that its registration from another state had expired. Defendant parking violations bureau subsequently towed the vehicle to the city pound. In each case, a municipality authorized, either by a contract and regulations or an ordinance, the seizure of the individual's vehicle without notice or consent and without judicial supervision.

The taker of the property has no interest or lien in the vehicle, there is no police power interest, and there is no risk to public health, safety or welfare; there is no important general public interest, there is no demonstrated need for prompt action, and neither the regulations nor the ordinance establish any standards of judgment.

They were charged for violating Village of Boonville, N.Y., Local Laws No. 1, &sect;&sect; 4.0-4.5 (1985) and were fined $ 500 for each violation. The collectors brought a motion to strike down the local law, and granted a temporary injunction. The matter was before the court for determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a village ordinance any collector of waste operating in the village was required to be licensed and as a license fee was charged the sum of $ 45 per ton for trash collected. The stated purpose of the local law was to promote the public health and safety, and to spread the cost of garbage and refuse disposal to fund a village transfer site. The law further required garbage haulers to obtain a permit and to pay a fee for the permit based on tonnage collected, but the fee was unrelated to the costs of licensing, inspecting, or regulating the pickup and hauling of garbage and refuse. Indeed, it had been admitted that the fees were to pay for the village transfer station costs. Thus, as the fee was unrelated to the cost of licensing, it was constitutionally defective. No mechanisms were provided by the law as to trash disposal, and the licensing law contained only arbitrary fees unrelated to where or how haulers disposed of trash. Therefore, the law was not reasonably related to the purpose intended. It was the opinion of the court that the local law was unreasonable and arbitrary and, thus, an unconstitutional use of the village police power.</SPAN></P>

The law is simply a revenue measure, imposed without any relationship to controlling solid waste disposal, and arbitrarily distinguishes between a hauler who has to pay even if it does not use the village trash facility, and an individual who pays a fee only if he disposes of his trash at the transfer facility.  </SPAN></P>

The managing agent argued that the statute violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution and the analogous provision of the state constitution. The trial court had already determined that the managing agent did not meet the requirements of the statute. While noting that the proper procedure after a trial but before a judgment was signed was to move for a new trial rather than for reargument, the trial court granted the motion to reargue. Upon an analysis of the constitutional issue, the trial court held that the statute was constitutional. The trial court held that it was not an unreasonable burden to require that persons who used the city as the place to earn a living must conduct their business in the city and, parenthetically, pay city taxes.</SPAN></P>

It is not an unreasonable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  burden to place on persons who seek to use the city as the place to earn a living that they actually use the city for the conduct of their business and pay city taxes.  Although respondent, having lost on a nonconstitutional factual defense at trial, would not ordinarily be permitted to raise a constitutional defense on a motion to reargue, the merits of the constitutional issue will be reached since there are numerous pending cases in which respondent's status as a managing agent is in issue.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought preliminary injunctive relief in its action pursuant to the state administrative and penal codes to close defendant's bathhouse as a public nuisance citing health risks following several on site inspections in which high risk sexual activity was taking place on a continuous and regular basis. Defendants brought a cross motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the action violated defendant's due process rights to privacy and freedom of association. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, because plaintiffs showed a compelling state interest in preserving the health of the population, that closure was the most reasonable and least intrusive remedy available, and plaintiff could exercise its police power because the impact on defendant' due process rights to entertainment or gratification were tangential to the risk to public health.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs have demonstrated a compelling State interest in acting to preserve the health of the population that takes precedence over any constitutional rights of privacy and free association and the remedy adopted by plaintiffs is the least intrusive reasonably available.  Defendants' constitutional rights will not be adversely affected by closure of the bath house in any event since the privacy protection of sexual activity conducted in a private home does not extend to commercial establishments simply because they provide an opportunity for intimate behavior or sexual release and the State police power will be upheld&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  over claims of constitutional rights of association where the nature of the assemblage is not for the advancement of beliefs and ideas but predominantly either for entertainment or gratification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord contended that the apartment was not subject to ETPA control because the legislature did not intend that the ETPA apply to a landlord owning a single co-op unit, application of the ETPA to the landlord would be unfair and cause extreme hardship, and N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 352-eee (5) superseded the ETPA. The court disagreed. There was no specific exclusion for cooperative apartment owners in the city's declaration of emergency, enacted in order to be protected under the ETPA, or in the ETPA itself. That the landlord owned only one co-op was immaterial because the ETPA only exempted buildings containing fewer than six units. The court construed the ETPA to apply to nonprofessional landlords because the ETPA covered housing accommodations not types of ownership. The ETPA was constitutional. Any hardships resulting to the landlord from enforcement of the ETPA were superceded by the public policy considerations during an acute housing shortage. The ETPA did not contain an exception for rental apartments in cooperatives and condominiums, and the existence of such an exception in &sect; 352-eee did not supercede the ETPA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ex-wife filed a motion for an order staying a hearing on the modification of plaintiff ex-husband's support obligations pursuant to N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 248 pending a determination as to the constitutionality and enforceability of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reviewed &sect; 248 and determined that it was constitutional. However, the court noted that alimony or maintenance should be based on economic rather than moral factors and urged the legislature to remedy what it termed a very unpopular and unnecessary law. Section 248 provided that a court could modify an ex-husband's support obligations to the ex-wife upon proof that the ex-wife was habitually living with another man and holding herself out as his wife. The court held that the right to cohabit and assert a status as a married individual was not a fundamental right and such cohabiting persons were not a suspect class triggering a review under the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; doctrine. The court found that , in the absence of a fundamental interest or a suspect class, the statute was simply required to be a rational means to a legitimate state objective. Based on the legislative history, the objective of the statute was to rectify a situation where an ex-wife was receiving alimony while she was being accepted by society as another man's wife. The court found the statute passed the rational basis test as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's anticohabitation, termination-of-alimony statute (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 248) which provides that the court may modify or annul previously ordered support &quot;upon application of the husband on notice, upon proof that the wife is habitually living with another man and holding herself out as his wife&quot;, is constitutional under any of three standards for determining the validity of a statute on equal protection grounds.  The right to cohabit and assert a status as a married individual is not a fundamental right and such cohabiting persons are not a suspect class triggering a review of the statute under the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; doctrine and, therefore, any constitutional challenge on this basis must fail.  Likewise, given the discretionary language of the statute, the absence of total termination of support in each individual case and the fact that the statute serves as a rational means to a legitimate State objective, a constitutional challenge to the statute on the basis of the &quot;rational basis&quot; standard must also fail.  The fact that the New York statute has been construed as gender neutral, and speaks in discretionary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and nonfatal terms thereby placing less of a burden on ex-spouses wishing to continue to receive alimony or maintenance in such situations than do other States, combined with the closer fit between statutory means and ends, is sufficient to shift the equal protection balance in favor of the State, and, accordingly, the statute is constitutional even under the third &quot;balancing of factors&quot; standard of review. </SPAN></P>

At trial, the arresting officer testified that defendant's helmet had been worn &quot;cowboy style,&quot; meaning that it was sitting on the back of the head and resting on the top of defendant's shoulders. Defendant contended that he had been wearing a helmet within the meaning of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 381(6). The court disagreed. A helmet was defined in N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 15, &sect; 54.2(a) as a device primarily intended to protect the upper part of the wearer's head against a blow. The blow could have been from the wearer's head striking the pavement or, more commonly, from the wearer being struck with rocks or other road debris. The court pointed out that in order to achieve its intended purpose, the helmet had to have been worn so that it covered the entire parietal and temporal bones and most of the frontal and occipital bones of the skull. A helmet that was worn &quot;cowboy style&quot; did not satisfy the requirements of N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 381(6).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was issued a traffic citation in the City of Corning, New York, for failure to wear his seat belt while operating a motor vehicle.

The driver alleged that the state legislature might have had improper motives in passing the bill. The state filed a motion for summary judgment, and the court granted the motion. The court found that the statute was constitutional, and noted that a court could not inquire into the motives of the legislature. Every legislative enactment carried with it a presumption that there existed the necessary factual support for its provisions, and the driver's mere conjecture was not enough to overcome the presumption. The court found that the statute was a valid exercise of constitutional power and that there had been an 18 percent reduction in occupant fatalities during the first six months after the seat belt law was passed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutional validity of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1229-c, which requires motorists to wear seat belts while operating a car, plaintiff motorist's argument that summary judgment must be denied inasmuch as there exist factual issues concerning the Legislature's intent in passing the statute, shall be rejected since plaintiff uses conjuncture and surmise to pose questions as to the individual intents of the lawmakers and a court may not inquire into the motives of the State Legislature; the fact that similar legislation had been introduced but failed to pass on many occasions does not persuade the court that it may explore the area of legislative intent. In the instant matter, there is no factual issue before the court which would preclude entertaining defendant's motion for summary judgment, since the Legislature is presumed to have investigated and found the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  necessary facts.  Moreover, judicial inquiry into legislative intent is only appropriate as an aid to statutory interpretation and then only when the statute in question is so ambiguous that its applicability to a particular circumstance is in doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Seat Belt Law -- Constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In determining whether a law compelling motorists to use seat belts (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1229-c) advances the State's interest in protecting the health, safety and welfare of its citizens pursuant to the police power, an appropriate test is whether it bears a reasonable and rational relationship to the purpose for which the law was enacted, and numerous studies have shown that the use of seat belts significantly lowers not only mortality rates but the severity of injuries.  The State has a compelling interest in saving lives and promoting the welfare of its citizenry, and fewer highway injuries lessen the economic burden on the rest of society by reducing hospitalization and rehabilitation costs, along with keeping productive members of society productive, such that plaintiff's arguments concerning his personal autonomy and the infringement on his right&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to make his own decision as to the use of seat belts are insufficient to invalidate a law designed to reduce a &quot;mounting carnage&quot; which has &quot;reached proportions of a public disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Seat Belt Law -- Constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Justiciable Question</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiff seeking to invalidate Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1229-c, which requires the use of seat belts in automobiles, plaintiff's argument that seat belts are dangerous must be rejected where no probative evidence was submitted to support that contention; the issue as to whether a seat belt is the perfect remedy is a policy question not subject to justiciable consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Seat Belt Law -- Constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1229-c, which mandates the use of seat belts in automobiles, does not run afoul of the equal protection clause by exempting rear seat passengers over a certain age in privately owned vehicles, taxis, liveries, tractors, trucks with a certain maximum gross weight, and buses other than school buses, since the classifications created by the statute are not based on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  race, alienage, age or nationality and, therefore, the strict scrutiny test is not indicated to determine whether the statute promotes a compelling governmental interest; needed is a &quot;rational basis&quot; test to determine if the varied treatment rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objective, and when a State regulates a problem, it is not under any obligation to regulate all phases of it or every class or acts or actors involved in it.  Accordingly, in light of the evidence that seat belts promote the public health and safety, and in deference to the principles of judicial restraint and separation of powers, the &quot;Seat Belt Law&quot; bears a rational relationship to the goals to be advanced and is, therefore, a valid exercise of legislative power.  </SPAN></P>

The court's original order granted defendant union's cross motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Stenographer members of the union and employees of the finance department transcribed finance department hearings and sold those transcripts to the parties involved or their attorneys. This practice had been on going for 30 years. The finance department unilaterally stopped the practice and prohibited the stenographers from selling the transcripts. The union filed suit against the finance department. The issues were resolved in favor of the union. One and one-half years later the finance department sought leave to renew and reargue the matter. The court granted only the city's motion for reargument. The court found that the finance department, as a governmental agency, lacked standing to assert the Freedom of Information Law, N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 84(6) et seq., as a petitioning sword rather than an exemption shield. The court held that the sale of the transcripts by the stenographers was deemed additional salary for 30 years and supported contractual consideration and negated any violation of N.Y. Const. art.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employee stenographers, and not the employer New York City Finance Department, may sell and retain all monetary proceeds for municipal agency hearing transcripts since Finance's past 30-year practice of allowing stenographers to charge and collect fees for the sale of transcripts taken at all formal hearings, using Finance's equipment and materials, except for the stenographers' own machines, is a term of employment contractually protected under the city's collective bargaining agreements.  The Finance Department, as a governmental agency, cannot be merged with the &quot;public&quot; as a petitioner under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL; Public Officers Law &sect; 84 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, therefore, lacks legal standing to assert a right of access to governmental records and to claim that its responsibility under FOIL to insure access gives it the power to sell the transcripts to the taxpayers.  Allowing stenographers to sell transcripts is not an unconstitutional gift of public funds (NY Const, art VIII, &sect; 1) since Finance's participation in the 30-year practice makes it inescapable that the fees from the sale of transcripts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  were not merely additional income but part of consideration for the stenographer's salary frozen into the city's collective bargaining agreements and such fees in lieu of salary were a saving to the taxpayers that could not be changed unilaterally by Finance especially so soon after bargaining with the stenographers' union over compensation and fringe benefits.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor proponents obtained petitions which sought to place upon the ballot a referendum to amend the city charter. The referendum would effectively have prohibited the board from approving any disposition of, or expenditure for, any city-owned property so as to facilitate the development of a military facility designed to have nuclear weapons.

The proponents argued the referendum merely prohibited the voluntary transfer of property and that the Federal Government could take any property by eminent domain proceedings. On remand from the appellate division, the court held that the proponents' petition to place the issue on the ballot passed judicial scrutiny and as such, the constitutionality of the proposed referendum was justiciable. The proposed referendum was unconstitutional because it was fashioned to hinder the effectuation of national security.

Law. &sect; 1229-c(3), which claimed defendant had operated an automobile while not wearing a seat belt as required by law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the mandatory seat belt law, N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law. &sect; 1229-c (3), was unconstitutional because it exceeded the permissible scope of the exercise of the state's police power and it also created an impermissible classification that violated defendant's due process and equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend, 14. Defendant also contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because an ordinary person had no way of knowing which safety belts were approved by state authorities. The court rejected defendant's arguments and determined the statute was constitutional and thus found defendant guilty of violating the statute. The court determined that the statute was a proper exercise of the state's police power and that it did not create an unconstitutional classification that deprived defendant of his right to due process and equal protection under the law. The court also noted that the void for vagueness challenge was not meritorious because no one had an inherent right to drive a car.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that any legislative enactment which was challenged on constitutional grounds was afforded a strong presumption of constitutionality, and the court would not set aside a statute as unconstitutional unless that result was inescapable. The court held that a law which placed a restriction upon an individual's freedom of action in the name of the police power had to bear some reasonable relation to the public good to be upheld as constitutional.

A regulation of the Long Island State Park, Recreation and Historic Preservation Commission (9 NYCRR 415.2), which prohibits the possession of beer or other alcoholic beverages in the Jones Beach State Park without a permit or unless purchased in the park, is unconstitutional since it does not require an intent to consume such beverage in the park; by making the mere possession of a can of beer a criminal offense because it had been purchased outside the park rather than at the park, the regulation criminalizes conduct which a person of ordinary intelligence would not perceive as criminal.  Even if the prohibition of possession of any alcoholic beverage, unless purchased from a park refreshment stand, was seen as intended to prevent public disorder and not merely to protect the economic interests of the refreshment concessions, the regulation's failure to prescribe the element of intent to consume such beverage in the park still renders it unconstitutional, and the court may not infer intent in order to salvage an otherwise&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  invalid provision.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, in the prosecution of a defendant accused of possessing beer in a State park in violation of a park regulation, defendant's dismissal motion directly challenged the constitutionality of the regulation, thereby making a determination thereof both necessary and unavoidable. </SPAN></P>

The court held that the law imposed permissible and constitutionally acceptable restrictions on the right of the landlord to evict the tenant from the apartment because the certificate of eviction was not final until almost one year after the effective date of the new law, there was no constitutional right to evict a rent-controlled tenant, and the enactment of the law rested on a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 proceeding in order to obtain a temporary restraining order preventing respondent commissioners from further widening of a roadway. The trial court (New York) granted the temporary restraining order and then modified so as to prohibit the commissioner only from widening the roadway on to the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gravamen of the landowners' petition was that the commissioner was about to commit a trespass upon their property by widening the road; therefore the court held that the appropriate remedy was injunctive relief. According to the court, where a road had obtained its character as a public highway by user, its width was to be determined by the width of the improvement. However, the court held that where road had been laid out under a statute, it was the statute not the user that determined the width. Furthermore, the court held that intent in enacting N.Y. High Laws &sect; 189 was to authorize the town superintendent to appropriate land that was actually in use, not land that was not in use. Therefore, the court held that the issue of whether the petition stated a cause of action depended upon the extent of the actual use of the road, which was a question of fact.</SPAN></P>

Both defendants moved pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. arts. 170 and 210 to dismiss the informations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants moved to dismiss the informations on the ground that Ocean Beach, N.Y., Code of Ordinances ch. 112 was unconstitutional, insufficient in law, and otherwise invalid. The court stated that the decisive question was whether the ordinance was so vague and impermissibly overbroad so as to vitiate its effectiveness. The court stated that N.Y. Village Law &sect; 4-412 empowered the board of trustees of a village to enact local laws to protect its property and the safety, health, comfort, and general welfare of its inhabitants. A village was permitted to enact a noise ordinance. The court rejected defendants' argument that the ordinance in the case at bar was impermissibly vague. Ocean Beach, N.Y., Code of Ordinances &sect; 112-5(A)(ii) was precise in defining unreasonable noise. Ocean Beach, N.Y., Code of Ordinances &sect; 112-5(J) was even more specific in prohibiting any other excessive or unusually loud sound which either annoyed, disturbed, injured, or endangered the comfort, repose, health, peace, or safety of a reasonable person of normal sensitivities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff Asian American group's declaratory action, which alleged that a zoning amendment was unconstitutional in that it was part of a master plan of neighborhood gentrification and planned shrinkage to exclude and displace low income Chinese persons from Chinatown in favor of a predominantly upper income population.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged zoning amendment included an incentive program for an increase in the present density requirements for qualifying developers. The complaint alleged that the zoning amendment was not the product of a &quot;well-considered plan&quot; and that a developer was granted a permit under the zoning amendment to construct luxury dwellings, which would displace low-income housing in Chinatown. The city argued that the zoning amendment established a rational and balanced plan for the Chinatown area pursuant to the laws and the N.Y. Const., which did not require a specific form of land use regulation and did not ensure the construction of low and moderate income housing. The court denied the motion to dismiss as to the claims of exclusionary zoning and held that the Mount Laurel doctrine was applicable in New York. The court further held that the Asian American group adequately stated a cause of action under the Mount Laurel doctrine and also under the Berenson standard of a well considered plan. However, the court granted the dismissal as to the claim, seeking to enjoin the city from granting a developer any form of tax exemption that had not yet been applied for by the developer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action to challenge a zoning amendment on the grounds that it unconstitutionally failed to provide for low- and moderate-income housing, defendant municipality's motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action shall be denied since to succeed on the motion, defendant was required to show that even assuming all of the allegations of plaintiffs' verified complaint were true and viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, the complaint set forth no basis upon which the amendment to the zoning resolution might be challenged; accordingly, inasmuch as plaintiffs have alleged causes of action cognizable under New Jersey law, which in the opinion of the court is applicable to New York since &quot;it is now appropriate to adopt&quot; such law, defendant's motion shall be denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Constitutional Mandate to Benefit Community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Zoning resolutions must be scrutinized in light of the needs of the community as a whole and once a priority community need has been identified, a developmental&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  scheme which ignores or does not make reasonable provisions to meet that need violates the constitutional or statutory mandate to regulate for the health, safety and welfare of the community; similarly, any reasoning by a municipality must not conflict with the fundamental land use policies and development plans of the community.  Moreover, the presumption of the validity and constitutionality attaching to municipal legislation is reputable, and when attacked, courts must examine the zoning and determine whether the constitutional requirements in both formulation and application have been satisfied, such that in determining whether a zoning resolution is designed to promote public health, safety and general welfare, and is a legitimate exercise of police power, the circumstances of each case must be examined.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action to challenge a zoning amendment as being part of a plan of gentrification to specifically exclude monitory and low-income people from New York City's Chinatown, the proper scope of inquiry for analysis is that line of cases involving exclusionary zoning since, while the instant amendment is not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  exclusionary as classically defined, if, as alleged, it will result in displacement of Chinatown's low-income residents, then its effect is the same.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. While a decision of the Appellate Division, Second Department, is entitled to be accorded great respect and weight, that courts does not have appellate jurisdiction over the Supreme Court in New York County, and accordingly, its holding is not binding upon Supreme Court, New York County, based on principles of stare decisis.  Therefore, Supreme Court may consider arguments presented in favor of and in opposition to the same issue presented to the Appellate Division and reach an independent determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In an action challenging a zoning amendment on the ground that it fails to provide for low- and moderate-income housing in violation of the constitutional mandate to provide for the people's general welfare, and that such failure runs counter to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mount Laurel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doctrine </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v Township of Mount Laurel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 67 NJ 151, 336 A2d 713, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">cert denied</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  423 U.S. 808, and 92 NJ 158, 456 A2d 390, in which the New Jersey Supreme Court invalidated a local zoning ordinance on the ground that it did not affirmatively provide a realistic opportunity for the town's fare share of low-income housing), it is the opinion of the court that it is now appropriate to adopt the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mount Laurel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doctrine as the law of New York, notwithstanding the fact that New York courts have previously been hesitant to adopt said doctrine because it places a heavier burden upon municipalities, since consideration of the important constitutional obligation to zone for the general welfare along with the lack of success in promoting the interest of low-income people resulting from the current zoning law requiring only a &quot;properly balanced and well-ordered plan&quot; for the community, leads to the conclusion that the New Jersey law shall govern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporation -- Zoning -- Failure to Provide for Low-Income Housing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In an action to challenge a zoning amendment on the grounds that, contrary to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mount Laurel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doctrine, a New Jersey decisional law requiring local zoning laws to affirmatively provide for low- and moderate-income housing, the general&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  welfare of the Chinatown's residence has not been addressed, plaintiffs state a cause of action by alleging that defendants have impermissibly overlooked the housing needs of current and future residents, and that implementation of the amendment will contravene the general welfare by promoting development which will displace predominantly low-income Asian Americans from Chinatown and preclude any reasonable opportunity for future development of low- and moderate-income housing. The fact that the zoning amendment uses incentives to discharge the municipality's obligation toward plaintiffs does not necessarily mean that it is valid as a matter of law, but, rather, presents an issue which must be explored a trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Well-Balanced Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In an action challenging a zoning amendment on the grounds that it fails to provide the community of Chinatown with a well-balanced plan which will serve the needs of low- and moderate-income people, the complaint states a cause of action under the standard set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Berenson v Town of New Castle</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (38 NY2d 102) where the amendment does not articulate the construction of low-income housing as one of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its goals, where the complaint alleges that the study upon which the amendment was based was piecemeal, inconclusive, discriminatory and based upon insufficient data, where, even accepting the study, the complaint alleges that it offers no basis upon which a mixed-income district may be created, were plaintiffs allege that the amendment does not relate at all to city-wide or regional needs and resources, where the incentives provided to developers pursuant to the amendment are allegedly illusory and may never result in the construction of low-income housing, where there is an apparent ambiguity concerning the implementation of a &quot;floor area bonus&quot; system whereby developers might not ever have to provide for low-income housing, and where a trial is required to resolve whether the zoning amendment facilities the construction of quality low-income housing, one of the needs of the Chinatown community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Plaintiffs' attempt to enjoin a municipality from granting any form of tax exemption to a developer is premature and fails to allege the existence of a justiciable controversy because the developer has not yet applied for an exemption; accordingly, declaratory judgment is not available when the existence of a controversy is dependent upon the happening of future events which may, in fact, never occur.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Woodstock, N.Y., Local Laws No. 3, &sect; 2 (1985) was invalid. Woodstock, N.Y., Local Laws No. 3, &sect; 2 (1985) provided, in part, that no person shall have in his possession with the intent to consume the contents thereof in certain places any open or unsealed bottle containing liquor. In finding that Woodstock, N.Y., Local Laws No. 3, &sect; 2 (1985) was void because of vagueness, the court found that it failed to meet constitutional standards because it did not distinguish between innocent conduct and action that was calculated to cause harm. A reasonable person could not say that any person carrying an unsealed container of an alcoholic beverage was intent upon drinking the alcohol publicly in violation of Woodstock, N.Y., Local Laws No. 3, &sect; 2 (1985).
