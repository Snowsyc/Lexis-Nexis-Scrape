<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, James Adkins, an inmate at the Chillicothe Correctional Institute, filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.  Appellant contended that he was convicted of a felony and received an indeterminate sentence of two to ten years; that he was paroled in 1981 and reincarcerated for a parole violation in 1984; and that he had been considered for parole on subsequent occasions, most recently in November 1987, when the Adult Parole Authority &quot;applied the new ohio [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] parole guidelines * * *, and pursuant to such guidelines, relator's case was continued for eighteen months.&quot; Appellant contended that the guidelines violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws, and that the guidelines' use by the authority was therefore an abuse of discretion.  He requested the court to compel the authority to grant him a new parole hearing under constitutional guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Chairman of the Adult Parole Authority, filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted under Civ.

The court of appeals granted the motion to dismiss, upholding the decision of its referee who concluded that appellant could prove no set of facts entitling him to relief in mandamus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before the court upon an appeal as a matter of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON MOTION TO DISMISS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, James E. Brown, has filed a complaint for a writ of mandamus in this court wherein he challenges the constitutionality of a provision of the Charter of the city of Stow that prescribes a two-year durational residency requirement for candidates for the office of city councilman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He alleges that he is a resident of Stow, Ohio; that on June 13, 1989 he filed a Nominating Petition and Statement of Candidacy with the respondent Summit County Board of Elections for the office of Councilman, First Ward for the full term commencing January 2, 1990; and that on July 10, 1989 the board of elections notified him that it would not certify his nominating petition because he would be unable to meet the Stow Charter residency requirement of two years' continuous residency prior to the date of his election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 4.03 of the Stow Charter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each councilman elected to represent a ward shall have been for at least 2 years prior to the date of his election, and during his term of office shall be, a continuous resident and qualified elector of the ward he represents, or territory annexed thereto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator seeks to compel the board of elections to place his name on the ballot for the primary election to be held September 12, 1989, alleging he meets all requirements other than the two-year durational requirement of the Stow Charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respondent board of elections admits that a primary election is scheduled for September 12, 1989, and that it has refused to place relator's name on the ballot because he will not have been a resident of Stow for two years at the time he would take office.  The board of elections admits that relator is qualified to run for the position except for not having been a resident of Stow for two years prior to the time he would be elected.  Respondent city of Stow in its answer states that the durational residency requirement is necessary in order to ensure knowledgeable candidates.  Respondent Stow also seeks to dismiss relator's complaint.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The candidate sought election as a city councilman. Respondent board of elections refused to place his name on the ballot because he did not meet the residency requirement found in &sect; 4.03 of the city's charter. The candidate filed a complaint, seeking a writ of mandamus, alleging that &sect; 4.03 violated the equal protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions. The city filed a motion to dismiss. The court overruled the motion, holding that the candidate was entitled to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 4.03 by mandamus. The court rejected respondents' argument that the candidate had an adequate remedy at law by appealing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506. The court denied the writ, holding that the city had a legitimate interest in imposing the two year residency requirement for the office of city councilman and that the requirement was rationally related to a legitimate city purpose. Whatever effect the requirement had on the candidate's right to travel interstate was too attenuated to warrant invocation of the strict standard of review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's estranged wife contended that their 2-year-old daughter complained that defendant had molested her during a weekend visitation. A pediatrician and a psychologist examined the child and believed that the she was abused. Defendant was tried on charges of felonious sexual penetration and imposition in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2907.12(A)(1)(b), 2907.05(A)(3). The trial court found that although the child was able to tell the truth and communicate, she was unavailable as a witness due to her refusal to talk. The pediatrician and psychologist testified at trial as to their belief that the child was abused, that she identified her father as the perpetrator, and that she told the truth. On appeal, the court determined that defendant was entitled to a new trial. The court held that although the pediatrician and psychologist were permitted to testify as experts pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 702-705, and the pediatrician's statements regarding the child's out-of-court identification of her father as the perpetrator were sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible, the trial court committed reversible error by admitting the experts' opinions as to the child's veracity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted insufficient evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, improper jury charge, improper jury instructions, and that the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal and in imposing the death penalty. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence, holding that the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion for acquittal pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A). The evidence was such that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions and the facts presented in the case enabled the trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of the offense charged, thereby excluding any reasonable theory of innocence. The court concluded that it could not say that but for the alleged error by the prosecutor during his closing argument, the jury's verdict would have been otherwise, and the death sentence was appropriate given the compelling nature of circumstantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Summit County, No. 12943.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of August 31, 1986, Wendy Offredo, twenty-one, and Dawn McCreery, twenty, finished their shift at the Brown Derby Restaurant in Montrose, Ohio.  Sometime after midnight on September 1, they left for the Harbor Inn, located in Portage Lakes.  They never arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their course of travel along Interstate Route 77 took them underneath the Stoner Street Bridge in Akron.  Appellant, Richard Wade Cooey II, on leave from the United States Army, was standing on the bridge with two friends, Clint Dickens and Kenneth Horonetz.  They were amusing themselves by throwing things off the bridge.  Just as Wendy and Dawn passed below, Dickens threw a large chunk of concrete over the side.  The concrete hit Wendy's car, forcing her to pull over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooey and his two friends went to offer assistance to Wendy and Dawn.  All five of them got into Cooey's car, and Cooey drove to a shopping mall, where they found a pay telephone on which Wendy called her mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Wendy was talking to her mother, Dickens saw money in her purse.  He suggested to Cooey and Horonetz that the three of them rob Wendy and Dawn. Cooey replied, &quot;I'm game&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  if you're game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone got back into the car, and the group left the mall.  When they realized Cooey was not returning to the site of the &quot;accident,&quot; the women asked Cooey where he was going.  He pulled out a knife and ordered them to &quot;shut up.&quot; He then gave the knife to Dickens, who opened it and held it on the women.  Dawn gave up her purse, while she and Wendy asked their assailants not to hurt them.  Cooey told Horonetz to tie Dawn's hands, whereupon Horonetz demanded to be let out of the car, and Cooey let him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After letting Horonetz out, Cooey drove to an isolated wooded area in Norton, Ohio, where Dickens raped Wendy.  Cooey later admitted to police that he tried to have sex with Dawn, but claimed that he stopped.  However, the coroner's examination indicated that Dawn had oral and vaginal intercourse before death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he was finished with Dawn, Cooey had oral and vaginal sex with Wendy.  While he was with Wendy, Cooey said, &quot;Hey, Clint, put on the Bad Company tape.&quot; After Cooey was finished with Wendy, he and Dickens put the women back into the car.  Dickens then told Cooey that he had not been &quot;really worried,&quot; although the women knew what he and Cooey looked like; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  however, now that they knew Dickens' first name, they would have to be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dickens and Cooey brought the women back outside.  Dickens began to beat Dawn with a nightstick belonging to Cooey.  Meanwhile, Cooey grabbed Wendy in a choke hold, rendering her unconscious.  He tied his bandanna around her ankles to keep her from kicking him.  Dickens then tossed Cooey a shoelace, and Cooey strangled Wendy with it while Dickens strangled Dawn with his other shoelace.  Cooey also beat both women with the night-stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooey and Dickens then stole Wendy's jewelry, dragged the bodies away from the road, and hid them in the weeds.  After brushing away their tire tracks with branches, they went to a car wash to get rid of the bloodstains on themselves and the car.  Finally, they discarded the purses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bodies were found later on September 1.  The Summit County Coroner concluded that Wendy and Dawn had died of multiple blows to the head -- Wendy received at least three blows and Dawn at least eleven -- with strangulation also contributing to Wendy's death.  He also concluded that both women had had oral and vaginal intercourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day the bodies were found, Cooey visited David Jones.  He &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  tried to sell Jones two watches (one made of black plastic), and other jewelry that was stained with blood.  Cooey explained to Jones how he had acquired them: &quot;* * * He said one of his buddies dropped * * * a rock off of a bridge onto the girl's car and that they * * * robbed them and raped them and then dumped them off behind Rolling Acres [Mall].&quot; Cooey also boasted that Jones &quot;should see a billy club now that it wasn't the original color.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That evening, Cooey had a visit from Terry Grant.  He confided to Grant that he had killed the women, describing &quot;how he beated [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] them three times and * * * strangled them with shoelaces * * *.&quot; Cooey then showed Grant the nightstick, telling him &quot;this was the stick that he beated [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] the girls with * * *.&quot; The stick was wrapped in black electrical tape.  The tape had blood on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 2, Cooey retrieved the purses and brought them to his house.  When Terry Grant came to visit that day, he found Cooey, Dickens, and Horonetz burning the purses and a pair of Cooey's gym shorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of September 2, Akron detectives arrested Cooey at home.  Cooey was wearing a watch later identified as Wendy's.  He asked the arresting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  officers if he could take it off and leave it with his grandmother.  They refused permission.  Other officers then obtained a warrant to search Cooey's house and car.  They found the nightstick in his room and several pieces of Wendy's jewelry in the pockets of a jacket in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the officers were searching, Cooey was being interrogated by an Akron police officer and a police detective.  They questioned him from 10:00 p.m. to 12:34 a.m. (during which time Cooey guided them to Dickens' house), from 1:55 to 2:14 a.m., and from 2:45 to 3:16 a.m. There was also some conversation, of indeterminate length, between 2:14 and 2:45.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Summit County Grand Jury indicted Cooey for the aggravated murder of Wendy Offredo, charging him with violating R.C. 2903.01(A) and (B).  Each aggravated murder count carried three specifications of aggravating circumstances: R.C. 2929.04 (A)(3), R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).  The indictment also charged Cooey with kidnapping Wendy with purpose to engage in sexual activity with her against her will, R.C. 2905.01(A)(4); vaginal and oral rape, R.C. 2907.02(A); and aggravated robbery, R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and (2).  Cooey was also charged with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  an identical array of crimes against Dawn McCreery.

The court affirmed the defendant's convictions and sentence of death. The court overruled all of the defendant's objections to issues that primarily affected his convictions. Among other things, the defendant challenged the admissibility of a tape-recorded statement he gave to police. The court rejected the defendant's arguments because the record did not support the defendant's allegation that the police officers had lied to him about a coroner's report, and even assuming the officers had lied the defendant's statement was not necessarily involuntary. The court found that there was sufficient evidence that support the convictions. As to the penalty phase, the court found that the trial court had committed some errors, but because the defendant failed to raise those issues before the appellate court, the court's review was limited to plain error, and none of the errors rose to that level. The court found that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Under proportionality review the court found the sentence proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Portage County, Nos. 1970 and 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 29, 1988, Virginia Harrell, appellee in case No. 88-1501, filed a petition with the Board of Education of the Streetsboro City School District (&quot;Streetsboro&quot;), appellant, pursuant to R.C. 3311.24, seeking transfer of approximately 32.917 acres of land from the Streetsboro City School District to the Kent City School District. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The petition consisted of two part-petitions and contained forty signatures.  On the date of the petition's filing, all the signers resided within the territory sought to be transferred.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Because Streetsboro brings both appeals and they involve many of the same issues, case Nos. 88-1501 and 88-1502 are consolidated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a public meeting on March 30, 1988, Streetsboro refused to file the petition with the State Board of Education (&quot;state&quot;) because it had determined that the petition did not contain the minimum number of valid signatures required by R.C. 3311.24.  Specifically, Streetsboro determined that four signatures could not be counted because two of them were printed, not written in cursive, one signer's name did not appear on the list of registered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  voters in the territory sought to be transferred, and because Harrell had signed a circulator's affidavit on one of the part-petitions in addition to having signed the petition itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 31, 1988, Harrell filed an amendment to her initial petition in the form of a supplemental part-petition containing seven signatures.  Among them were new signatures for the four signers whose signatures had been invalidated by Streetsboro.  The two printed signatures were signed in cursive on the supplemental part-petition, and the circulator's affidavit was completed by someone other than Harrell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its next regularly scheduled meeting on April 14, 1988, Streetsboro reaffirmed its decision with respect to Harrell's February 29 petition.  Because R.C. 3311.24 provides a filing deadline of &quot;prior to the first day of April in any even-numbered year,&quot; Streetsboro also determined that the amendment to the petition filed on March 31 had not been received in time for it to examine the petition's sufficiency before sending it to the state.  As a result, Streetsboro also did not file the petition as amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An R.C. 3311.24 petition is to be signed by seventy-five percent of the qualified electors&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  residing within that portion of a city proposed to be transferred and voting at the last general election.  According to stipulations filed below, there were sixty-one qualified electors residing in that portion of Streetsboro proposed to be transferred on November 3, 1987, the date of the general election prior to the events at bar.  Fifty of those electors were listed in the poll book as having voted in that election.  On February 29, 1988, the date that Harrell delivered her initial petition, there were fifty-seven qualified electors residing in that portion of Streetsboro proposed to be transferred.  Forty-eight of those electors had voted in the election on November 3, 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrell sought a writ of mandamus against both Streetsboro and the state in the Court of Appeals for Portage County on April 1, 1988.  The court of appeals granted the writ on July 11, 1988 by directing Streetsboro to file her petition and its amendment with the State Board of Education and by directing the state to accept them.  Streetsboro appeals this decision. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;The State Board of Education, on the other hand, has basically acquiesced in the court of appeals' order.  Indeed, the state stipulated even prior to the appellate court's decisions in both case No. 88-1501 and case No. 88-1502 that it would consider any petitions filed by Streetsboro as if they had been filed on the statutorily required date.  Thus, although a respondent below, the state now opposes Streetsboro's position on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On February 29, 1988, Carmen Celigoj, appellee in case No. 88-1502, filed a petition with Streetsboro pursuant to R.C. 3311.24, seeking the transfer of approximately 15.13 acres of land from the Streetsboro City School District to the Kent City School District.  The petition contained the signatures of Carmen Celigoj and Frank Celigoj, the two people who live in and own the territory sought to be transferred.  The Celigojs are both registered voters who voted in the general election of November 3, 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a public meeting on March 30, 1988, Streetsboro refused to submit the petition to the State Board of Education because it had determined that the petition did not contain the minimum number of valid signatures required by R.C. 3311.24.  Specifically, Streetsboro determined that Carmen Celigoj's signature was invalid because she had also signed the circulator's affidavit on the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 31, 1988, Carmen Celigoj delivered an amended petition in the form of two part-petitions.  One of the part-petitions contained her signature and a circulator's affidavit that had been completed by Frank Celigoj.  The other part-petition contained the signature of Frank Celigoj and a circulator's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  affidavit that had been completed by Carmen Celigoj.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its next regularly scheduled meeting on April 14, 1988, Streetsboro reaffirmed its decision with respect to Carmen Celigoj's initial petition.  Again on the basis of the filing deadline in R.C. 3311.24, Streetsboro also determined that the amended petition was not filed in time for it to determine the petition's sufficiency before sending it to the state.  As a result, Streetsboro also did not forward the amended petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carmen Celigoj sought a writ of mandamus against Streetsboro and the state in the court of appeals on April 1, 1988.  The court of appeals granted the writ on July 11, 1988 by directing Streetsboro to file her petitions with the State Board of Education and by directing the state to accept them.  Streetsboro appeals this decision as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

In its decision, the intermediate appellate court ordered the school district to file the petitions with the state board of education and ordered the state board of education to accept the petitions. On review, the court affirmed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court. In reaching its decision, the court found that mandamus relief was appropriate based on the facts of the cases. The court held that the voters had a clear legal right to have the school district file the transfer petitions, that the school district was under a corresponding clear legal duty to file the transfer petitions, and that the voters had no plain and adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1986, the three owners of a parcel of property situated within the Rossford Exempted Village School District, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wood County (&quot;Rossford&quot;), and bordering, in part, on the Perrysburg Exempted Village School District, Wood County (&quot;Perrysburg&quot;), requested that their property be transferred from the Rossford to the Perrysburg School District pursuant to R.C. 3311.24.  The Rossford Board of Education adopted a resolution rejecting the requested transfer and transmitted both the request for transfer and the board's resolution of disapproval to the State Department of Education.  The Rossford board recommended that the transfer be disapproved.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The State Board of Education correctly indicated to the court of appeals that the name used by plaintiff should have been &quot;Board of Education of the Rossford Exempted Village School District&quot; rather than &quot;Rossford Exempted Village School District.&quot; This fact, however, does not affect the merits of this case and it is understood that the plaintiff is the Rossford Board of Education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary of the State Board of Education notified both school districts that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in accordance with the provisions of R.C. 119.07, the state board intended to consider the transfer and that pursuant to R.C. Chapter 119 the parties were entitled to a hearing.  Pursuant to that notice, Rossford requested a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter was heard by a referee, who, following a hearing, recommended that the State Board of Education approve the request for transfer.  Rossford filed objections to the referee's recommendation.  However, at a September 8, 1986 meeting, the State Board of Education overruled the objections and approved the transfer of territory.  Rossford appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, naming the State Board of Education and the property owners as defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property owners filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that an order of the State Board of Education approving a transfer of property pursuant to R.C. 3311.24 is a legislative act which is not appealable pursuant to R.C. 119.12.  The State Board of Education also filed a motion to dismiss, alleging &quot;lack of subject matter jurisdiction and/or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.&quot; The trial court agreed that the State Board of Education's decision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was a legislative act and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tenth District Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the cause to the trial court, holding that a village board of education has a right, pursuant to R.C. 119.12, to appeal the state board's decision in an R.C. 3311.24 proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 7, 1984, Alton Coleman (appellant), and Debra D. Brown approached the home of the Reverend and Mrs. Millard Gay of Dayton, Ohio.  After conversing with Mr. Gay, they stayed at the Gays' home from July 7 through July 9, 1984.  Appellant and Brown accompanied the Gays to religious services in Lockwood, Ohio, on July 9, 1984.  The next day, the Gays drove appellant and Brown to downtown Cincinnati and dropped them off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 11, 1984 at approximately 10:00 a.m., Tonnie Storey, age fifteen, left her home in Cincinnati wearing rusty brown cutoff shorts, a beige sleeveless blouse with yellow rings, blue tassel shoes and a Michael Jackson button.  She was next seen at Bloom Junior High School at approximately 11:45 a.m. by a teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that same day, between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m., a classmate saw Tonnie on the corner of May and Morgan Streets in Cincinnati in the company of a man and a woman.  The classmate identified the man as Coleman.  When Tonnie had not returned home by 4:30 p.m. that day, her mother called the police and reported her missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 19, 1984, a body was discovered in an abandoned building&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on May Street by a real estate agent.  A Michael Jackson button and a pair of brown shorts with keys in the pocket were discovered in the area where the body was found.  The keys identified by decedent's father belonged to the Storey residence.  The body was badly decomposed and identification was made through fingerprints.  The body was identified as that of Tonnie Storey.  The cause of death of Tonnie was homicidal asphyxia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and Brown were jointly indicted for the murder of Tonnie on October 10, 1984, in a three-count indictment containing specifications.  The first specification charged pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) was that the aggravated murder was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons.  The second death-penalty specification was dismissed prior to trial.  The third specification charged pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) was that the offense was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for another offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was tried separately from co-indictee Brown.  The jury found appellant guilty of aggravated murder and guilty of specification No. 1.  The mitigation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hearing was held one day after the guilt phase was completed, and the jury recommended the penalty of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Admission of &quot;other acts&quot; evidence linking defendant to five other murders was proper because it revealed a unique, identifiable plan of criminal activity. Nor was it error to admit testimony by a prosecuting attorney, the only witness available on a critical issue. Claims of error relating to the grand jury, to denial of a motion to change venue, to the timing of trial, and to the severance of his trial from a co-indictee's trial were all rejected. The court rejected claims arising from the trial court's refusal to appoint a jury-selection expert and other juror-related claims, including the trial court's excusing for cause those jurors who refused to impose the death penalty. The court also rejected constitutional claims based on the fact that the penalty phase began the day after the guilt phase concluded because defendant did not claim that mitigating evidence would have been available in any event. Defendant's efforts to invoke his grandmother's constitutional rights were rejected, as were his claims of insufficient evidence, ineffective assistance, and constitutional defects in the state death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>

Shortly thereafter, Howard and her children moved in with Kevin McCoy, who shared a duplex apartment with Davida McClain and her children, Tony, Donya, and Nicole.  Nicole was also known as Sue.  The apartment was located at 1552 1/2 Pinewood in Toledo, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon discovering Howard's new address, appellant went there on May 26, 1985 in an attempt to renew his relationship with Howard.  When Howard rebuffed appellant's overtures for a reconciliation, appellant assaulted her.  This assault was witnessed by Curtis Jewell, a patrolman with the Toledo Police Department who was off-duty at the time.  Jewell asked his father to call the police and went to assist Howard.  As a result of this incident, appellant was placed under arrest and charged with disorderly conduct.  Subsequently, Howard, her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  children and McCoy went to the residence of McCoy's mother and returned to the Pinewood apartment at approximately 2:30 a.m. on May 27, 1985.  At that time, Howard found a note on her car window from appellant.  Approximately an hour later, Howard saw appellant at the side of the Pinewood apartment and promptly called the police.  Howard testified that she called the police again at approximately 4:00 a.m. upon hearing someone at the side of the apartment, and phoned them again approximately one-half hour later when she observed appellant near the apartment.  Upon investigating each time, the police were unable to locate appellant in the vicinity of the apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter, however, Howard testified that she heard a window in the apartment bathroom being opened, whereupon she awakened McCoy.  McCoy left the bedroom, grabbed a chair and apparently charged toward the bathroom window.  Howard ran out the door and down the stairs when she heard a crash and a gunshot.  Upon running to a nearby house, she called the police.  Before the police could respond to the call, appellant shot McCoy in the chest and in the back of the head.  Appellant also shot Nicole McClain twice in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  face.  The record indicates that McCoy died at the scene, and that McClain died within approximately two hours of the shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was arrested at approximately 6:00 a.m. next to the rear stairwell outside the Pinewood apartment.  The arresting officers recovered a .22 caliber nine-shot revolver from appellant that was later identified as the murder weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 31, 1985, appellant was indicted by the grand jury on two counts of aggravated murder ( R.C. 2903.01 [B]).  Each count carried a felony murder specification ( R.C. 2929.04 [A][7]) and a mass murder specification ( R.C. 2929.04[A][5]), as well as firearm specifications ( R.C. 2929.71).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 18, 1985, appellant waived his right to a trial by jury.  Consequently, his trial before a three-judge panel commenced on November 4, 1985.  The guilt phase of the trial concluded the following day, whereupon the panel returned verdicts finding appellant guilty of both counts of aggravated murder, as well as the specifications attached to those counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mitigation hearing took place immediately thereafter, and on November 7, 1985, the panel announced its judgment that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  factors beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, the panel imposed the death sentence for each count of aggravated murder and two consecutive three-year terms of actual incarceration for the conviction of the two firearm specifications.  On November 13, 1985, the panel entered its judgment entry of sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about December 16, 1987, the City Council of the city of Struthers, Ohio, passed Ordinance No. 87-8482, establishing rates to be charged by Ohio Water Service Company for water supplied to the city and its inhabitants for a two-year term commencing January 1, 1988.  Section 10 of the ordinance provides in relevant part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure * * *.  Said emergency exists by reason of the fact that said rates must be established and contract must be entered into immediately, and, as such, this Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 12, 1988, appellant Tony Marchionda, a taxpayer of the city of Struthers, filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (&quot;commission&quot;) entitled &quot;Taxpayers' Complaint as to Unreasonable and Unjust Rates Pursuant to O.R.C. 4909.36.&quot; Attached to the complaint were copies of petitions purporting to bear the signatures of a total of 1,835 registered voters of the city of Struthers who supported the complaint filed before the commission.  In objecting to the contract &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rates entered into by the city and the Ohio Water Service Company, the complainants-appellants requested &quot;* * * that this matter be set for hearing at a convenient location here in Mahoning County within a reasonable time in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By entry of March 8, 1988, the commission </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it was without jurisdiction to review the terms of the ordinance contract by virtue of the holding in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Link </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In the dispute over the rates set by the city and the water utility, the taxpayers sought appellate relief but were stopped at the outset by Commission's sua sponte dismissal of their complaint. In affirming that decision, the court noted that the Commission was without jurisdiction to review the terms of the ordinance contract pursuant to Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 5 that allowed municipalities to contract with any company by ordinance. Further, &sect; 5 required 30 days before the ordinance became effective, during which time the only challenges to the contract could come from 10 percent of the electors demanding a referendum. If such referendum were demanded, then the ordinance could not take effect until it had been submitted to the electors and approved by a majority. Thus, the court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.36 was constitutionally invalid in its provisions allowing 10 percent of the electors to file complaints with the Commission in lieu of seeking a referendum. Therefore, the court ruled that the Commission acted properly, and was neither unreasonable nor unlawful, in dismissing the complaint in reliance on prior caselaw and the constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON REHEARING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 8, 1973, Robert J. Doersam sustained an injury in the course of his employment.  Upon application for workers' compensation benefits, Doersam's claim was initially allowed for myocardial infarction.  On September 27, 1983, Doersam suffered a second myocardial infarction, again in the course of his employment.  Doersam's second myocardial infarction was fatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Betty Doersam, the surviving spouse of Doersam, filed a claim for death benefits on behalf of herself and her minor daughter.  Her claim was allowed, by a district hearing officer, and appellee was awarded sixty-six and two-thirds percent of Doersam's average weekly wage but not to exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the statewide average weekly wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee objected to this award, claiming that she was entitled to receive sixty-six and two-thirds percent of her deceased husband's average weekly wage but not to exceed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">one hundred percent</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the statewide average weekly wage.  Based on her objection, appellee appealed the award to the Columbus Regional Board of Review.  The regional board affirmed the order of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the district hearing officer.  Appellee appealed to the Industrial Commission which affirmed the board of review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 25, 1986, appellee commenced an action in mandamus in the court of appeals.  In her mandamus action, appellee challenged the constitutionality of the statutory structure of death benefits found in R.C. 4123.59 (B).  Appellee's contention was that the statutory provisions found in R.C. 4123.59(B) denied her equal protection under the law and, in addition, violated Section 26, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals, acting pursuant to its constitutional authority in original actions, granted appellee's request for a writ of mandamus.  The court of appeals ordered the commission &quot;* * * to vacate its order for an award of death benefits and to award said benefits at the maximum compensation provided in R.C. 4123.59.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In issuing its order, the court of appeals held that the statute in question ( R.C. 4123.59[B]) violated the Equal Protection Clause because the classification of death-benefits recipients set forth in R.C. 4123.59(B) had no rational basis and was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  therefore violative of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the judgment of the court of appeals, the commission-appellant appealed to this court.  On December 30, 1988, this court issued its first decision in this case.  In that decision, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State, ex rel. Doersam, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Indus. Comm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 201, 533 N.E. 2d 321, we held, by a split vote, that R.C. 4123.59(B), as amended in 1976, was unconstitutional and that the statute was to be reverted to its pre-1976 language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From that decision, both parties requested a rehearing.  This request was joined by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">amici curiae</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, AFL-CIO and the United Autoworkers of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 22, 1989, we granted rehearing and ordered that the issue be rebriefed and the case be set for oral argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellee, surviving spouse of a person who died from a myocardial infarction at work, brought a claim for workers' compensation. Appellant company sought review from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which awarded death benefits at the maximum compensation as provided in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.59.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellee, in her original action in the court of appeals, challenged the language in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4123.59(B) which would have entitled appellee to more per week if the injury occurred after January 1, 1976, and less if it occurred prior to January 2, 1976. The court of appeals found that such language violated the equal protection clause. The court reviewed whether the language in the statute brought about the violation of the constitutional rights of certain &quot;wholly dependent&quot; persons. The court found &sect; 4123.59(B), as written, legislatively created separate classifications of &quot;wholly dependent&quot; persons based only on the date when an injury to a worker occurred. The court could not find that the establishment of the separate classes was for the advancement of any legitimate governmental purpose. Thus, the statute created a suspect class and, therefore, was violative of the guarantee of protection of equal laws. The court found, however, that the remainder of the statute was effective and operable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Summit County, No. 13020. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant and cross-appellee, Warren L. Schump, was employed as a truck driver by appellee and cross-appellant, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company (&quot;Firestone&quot;), working out of Firestone's Brookpark Retread Center.  On July 12, 1983, Schump was driving a truck within the scope of his employment, which truck was equipped with tires manufactured by Firestone.  Evidently one of the front tires blew out, and Schump suffered personal injuries when he lost control of the truck and veered into an embankment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 1, 1985, Schump and his wife filed the instant complaint against Firestone.  The first claim for relief alleged various theories of products liability, including strict liability, breach of implied warranty, and negligence.  The second claim for relief alleged an intentional tort, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that Firestone &quot;intentionally and/or with the belief that injury was substantially certain to occur, failed to replace the defective truck tire on the tractor-trailer operated by * * * Schump * * *.&quot; The complaint also included a claim by Mrs. Schump for loss of her husband's services, society, companionship, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and consortium.  Firestone answered, denying the allegations of liability and asserting seven affirmative defenses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 8, 1986, Firestone filed a motion for summary judgment in its favor on all allegations.  In its memorandum in support of this motion, Firestone argued that the evidence does not show intentionally tortious conduct by Firestone, and that because Schump was injured in the course of his employment, his recourse is under the Workers' Compensation Act and not in a civil action for damages.  Plaintiffs' response was twofold: (1) that intentional tort actions are not barred, and that such an action may be maintained under the facts of this case; and (2) that a products liability action may be maintained under the &quot;dual-capacity doctrine,&quot; since, with regard to the tires on the truck Schump was driving, Firestone's relationship to Schump was both employer to employee and manufacturer to product user. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its reply, Firestone discussed the 1986 amendment to the Workers' Compensation Act, specifically R.C. 4121.80, and its applicability to plaintiffs' action.  Firestone argued that the evidence fails to establish an &quot;intentional tort&quot; as defined in R.C. 4121.80(G)(1), &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and that, under the language of R.C. 4121.80(B), the workers' compensation system has completely abrogated the &quot;common law dual-capacity exception&quot; to employer immunity.  In the alternative, Firestone argued that the dual-capacity doctrine is inapplicable here.  Thereafter, the parties filed opposing memoranda addressing the constitutionality or retroactively applying the 1986 workers' compensation amendments in this case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 20, 1987, the trial court applied R.C. 4121.80 and granted Firestone's motion for summary judgment as to all issues.  Regarding plaintiffs' dual-capacity claim, the court evidently was of the view that R.C. 4121.80(B) had not completely eliminated the dual-capacity doctrine.  Nevertheless, the court held that the dual-capacity doctrine is inapplicable in this case.  The court also held that under R.C. 4121.80(G), plaintiffs' intentional tort claim could not be maintained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  Relying on this court's cases on the dual-capacity doctrine, the court agreed that an action under the doctrine may not be maintained here.  However, the court sustained plaintiffs' assignment of error regarding the application&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of R.C. 4121.80, holding that retroactive application would be unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion and cross-motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer on the employee and his spouse's claim under the dual capacity doctrine was proper. In order for the dual-capacity doctrine to apply, there had to be an allegation and showing that the employer occupied two independent and unrelated relationships with the employee, that at the time of these roles of the employer there were occasioned two different obligations to this employee, and that the employer had during such time assumed a role other than that of employer. The employee did not make this showing. The court also found that reversal of the grant of summary judgment on the employee and his spouse's intentional tort claim was proper because retroactive application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80, which barred this claim, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffrey J. Lawrence, appellant herein, his wife Janet, and their children lived next door to Jesse Mooney, his wife Cheryl, and their children in Garfield Heights, Ohio.  Although their relationship was initially friendly, several neighborhood disputes caused the friendship to deteriorate to a state of intense hostility. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early afternoon hours of August 24, 1985, a party began in the Mooney garage.  As the evening wore on, the party involved drinking beer, listening to music, and dancing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disturbed by the noise of the party, appellant called the Garfield Heights Police Department shortly after 11:00 p.m. to complain.  The investigating officer spoke with Jesse Mooney, found no cause for the complaint, and returned to routine patrol duties.  The party continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 1:45 a.m., Cheryl Mooney and Chuck Vlach returned from another party.  At this time, the party in the Mooney garage consisted of Jesse, Cheryl, and Heidi Mooney, as well as Thurman and Deborah Dempsey, John Gilbert, and Chuck Vlach.  The Garfield Heights Police Department received the next complaint about the party from Janet Lawrence at approximately&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3:15 a.m. The investigating officer returned to the scene and heard low music.  He advised Jesse Mooney that the police had received another complaint and asked him to move the party into the house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the officer's departure, an angry verbal exchange occurred between the people at the Mooney party and the appellant.  Cheryl Mooney yelled towards the Lawrence house suggesting that Janet Lawrence had called the police.  Appellant responded by yelling from a second-story window ordering the Mooneys to shut up.  Words in the nature of a challenge were shouted back at appellant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned about her husband's possible reaction to the challenge, Janet Lawrence went upstairs where she found him dressing.  As appellant left the bedroom, he picked up some shotgun shells and told Janet to call the police.  She called the police as he left the house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes, the first shot was fired by appellant from his backyard.  The shotgun pellets struck Cheryl Mooney and Thurman Dempsey.  As Cheryl Mooney staggered into the garage, Jesse Mooney moved to the front of the garage and fired two shots from a handgun toward appellant's house.  Running from his yard and across the front of the Mooney&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  residence, appellant proceeded up the driveway and fired several more shots.  Jesse Mooney was fatally struck with pellets from at least two of appellant's shotgun blasts.  Heidi Mooney and Deborah Dempsey were also struck by shotgun pellets.  Continuing into the garage, appellant threw Cheryl Mooney on top of her husband and fired a shot at close range causing her death.  Appellant then left the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 30, 1985, Lawrence was indicted by the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury on two counts of aggravated murder, each containing a multiple-murder and a firearm specification, and three counts of attempted murder, all with firearm specifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial began on March 10, 1986.  After the state had rested, appellant called a number of witnesses, including Dr. John P. Wilson, a clinical psychologist.  Wilson testified that appellant suffered from four disorders at the time of the shootings.  &quot;First is the major depression, major depressive disregard [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">]; secondly is the post traumatic stress disorder, chronic; third is dissociative disorder, and four is schizotypal personality disorder.&quot; Wilson testified that it was his considered opinion that appellant was in a dissociative&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  state and could not distinguish right from wrong and could not refrain from his actions at the time of the homicides. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Appellant had served in the armed forces and was briefly stationed in Vietnam from December 1972 through January 1973.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drs. William H. Grant and Phillip J. Resnick, psychiatrists called as state witnesses, disagreed with Wilson's opinion that appellant was unable to distinguish right from wrong at the time of the shootings.  However, they concurred in Wilson's conclusion that appellant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  Resnick explained that this disorder &quot;is manifested by sleep disturbance, startling easily during loud noises, and results from being subjected to a major stress.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conclusion of all evidence at the guilt phase, the trial court instructed the jury on the charges in the indictment and, upon request by the state and without objection by defense counsel, on the lesser included offense of murder.  The trial court refused appellant's request for an instruction on the offense of voluntary manslaughter.  The trial court also instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of insanity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 4, 1986, the jury found the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant guilty of two counts of aggravated murder, the multiple-murder and firearm specifications, and two counts of attempted murder and two additional firearm specifications.  Sequestered until the penalty phase began on April 7, 1986, the jury recommended the imposition of the death penalty after one day of deliberation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 17, 1986, the trial court followed the jury's recommendation.  In addition to the imposition of the death penalty on both counts of aggravated murder, the trial court sentenced appellant to not less than ten and not more than twenty-five years on the two counts of attempted murder, with three years' actual incarceration on the firearm specifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences on May 2, 1988.  The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

The jury also found defendant guilty of multiple-murder and firearm specifications, two counts of attempted murder, and two additional firearm specifications, and the trial court imposed additional sentences on those counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was a Vietnam veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome. The State's doctors disputed whether he suffered from other disorders. Defendant's relationship with his neighbors was hostile. Defendant shot at his neighbors and their guests, killing two of them, after the neighbors verbally abused him for calling the police to complain about a party they were hosting. Affirming defendant's conviction, the court held inter alia that the trial court properly refused to give an instruction on voluntary manslaughter because the jury could not have found that the provocation was reasonably sufficient to have incited him into using deadly force. The court vacated both death sentences because the aggravating circumstances did not outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that five of the seven mitigating factors in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2929.04(B) were present, including that one victim's return of fire provoked defendant to continue firing. The court also took into account defendant's care of his mother during high school, his voluntary military service, his love for his children, and the severe depression caused by his son's death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the record the petitioners have presented to us there is no indication that a demand (or a request) to proceed was made on either the attorney general or the county prosecutor.

Petitions for annexation were filed with the Board of Commissioners of Warren County (&quot;board&quot;) the next day.  On April 15, the council adopted three new ordinances authorizing, in effect, the filing of amended petitions, apparently in order to make technical changes reflecting the fact that each of the three tracts was solely owned by Warren County. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These amended petitions were filed the next day. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

The trial court determined the amended provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.16 were procedural and thus could be applied retroactively to the amended petitions. The court of appeals partially reversed the judgment because the amended provisions would violate the proscription against retroactive laws contained in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The county board of commissioners and the county agricultural society sought review. The court affirmed the judgment because (1) the amended provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.16 were not expressly made retrospective by the General Assembly, (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12 did not require that the attorney general be made a party to the action, and (3) the county agricultural society was not the owner of the land under Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Port Clinton Fish Company (&quot;Port Clinton&quot;), indisputably, is an Ohio corporation engaged in both retail and wholesale distribution of fish.  On December 17, 1985, Ohio Division of Wildlife officers entered appellant's facility in Toledo and inspected seven boxes of walleye fillets.  The boxes were labeled &quot;Olmstead Foods,&quot; and were allegedly purchased from a Canadian company.  Upon inspection, the officers determined that the boxes contained forty-two percent &quot;undersized&quot; walleye by weight.  The fish were seized and appellant company was charged with possession of walleye &quot;more than 10% undersize[d] by weight&quot; in violation of R.C. 1533.63 and Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-02(A). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After trial in the Toledo Municipal Court, appellant was found guilty and appealed that judgment to the court of appeals.  The appellate court affirmed, holding that R.C. 1533.63 and Ohio Adm. Code 1501:31-3-02 do not represent an unconstitutional interference with or burden on interstate commerce.  Further, the court of appeals ruled that enforcement of the regulations did not abridge appellant's right to contract. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The company was a commercial fishing operation. On appeal, the company claimed that Ohio Admin.

Code Ann. &sect; 1533.63, which prohibited commercial fishing of walleye in Ohio waters, all such fish traded commercially in the State were required, by necessity, to be caught outside Ohio. The court ruled with a legitimate state purpose of protection and propagation of walleye in the State as its basis, and only minimal intrusion on the affected parties, Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 1501:31-3-02 did not violate the Commerce Clause. Section 1501:31-3-02 was &quot;evenhanded&quot; in that it neither favored local enterprise nor facially discriminated against interstate commerce, it involved a legitimate state interest, and there were no less restrictive means of promoting the state interest.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 17, 1986, Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (&quot;Columbia&quot;), intervening appellee herein, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brought a complaint pursuant to R.C. 4905.26 against Atwood Resources, Inc. (&quot;Atwood&quot;), appellant herein.  Columbia alleged that Atwood, a producer of natural gas operating in and around Newcomerstown, Ohio, had bypassed complainant's existing pipeline facilities and was making retail sales of natural gas through its own facilities to Simonds Cutting Tools (&quot;Simonds&quot;); had installed facilities and had made arrangements to make sales of natural gas to Kurz-Kasch, Inc. (&quot;Kurz-Kasch&quot;); and was soliciting other consumers concerning possible direct sales of natural gas. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Columbia, in its brief before this court, describes itself as a natural gas distribution company that currently provides retail gas service to more than one million customers in all or part of sixty-nine counties in Ohio, including the area in and around the village of Newcomerstown, and also provides gas transportation services to approximately eighteen hundred customers who have acquired their own supplies of natural gas.  Columbia acknowledges it is a &quot;natural gas company&quot; and a &quot;public utility&quot; within the meaning of R.C. 4905.03 (A)(6) and 4905.02, and further acknowledges it is subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Columbia maintained that Atwood's activities constituted those of a public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (&quot;commission&quot;), appellee herein, but that it had failed to submit to regulation and to comply with the applicable laws.  Columbia also alleged that Atwood's activities had displaced, or would displace, its sales to these consumers, causing Columbia lost revenues and injury to its remaining customers who will ultimately pay higher rates because of the displaced sales.  Columbia requested the commission to find that Atwood is a public utility and a natural gas company under R.C. 4905.02 and 4905.03(A)(6), and to order Atwood to cease making or soliciting direct sales of natural gas to consumers through its own pipeline facilities in violation of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By an attorney-examiner's entry issued February 4, 1987, the commission found that reasonable grounds for complaint had been stated and set the matter for public hearing.  The hearing was held, as rescheduled, on May 4, 1987. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 4, 1987, the commission issued a decision in which it concluded that the direct sales of natural gas to Simonds and to Kurz-Kasch constituted public &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  utility activities and that Atwood was a public utility and a natural gas company.  It further concluded that by engaging in these activities without submitting to regulation, Atwood was causing injury to Columbia.  The commission ordered Atwood, within a specified period of time, to either comply with the public utility regulations or cease its direct sales of natural gas to Simonds and Kurz-Kasch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atwood filed a timely application for rehearing, which was denied by entry issued September 15, 1987. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A competitor complained to the Commission that a private natural gas supplier, which was not regulated by the Commission, was selling natural gas. The Commission found that the supplier was a public utility subject to regulation and ordered the supplier to cease the sales or comply with state regulations. The supplier appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the Commission was authorized under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.26 to hear actions brought by a competing public utility against a supplier whose activities should have been regulated as a public utility. The supplier's sales to two customers caused economic loss to the competitor, a regulated entity, and its consumers. Private contracts for the sale of natural gas were subject to Commission regulation because the product sold was subject to such regulation. The court found that the supplier's activities were sufficient to meet the definition of public utility because of the sizeable and recurring nature of the sales. Because the supplier engaged in business of an industry that was regulated, it should have known that it was subject to regulation as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In disposing of preliminary matters on appeal, the court rejected the sellers' challenge to the municipal court's jurisdiction and their contention that the controversy was moot because the specific magazines had been withdrawn from circulation. This case was tried without a jury. The sellers argued that the municipal judge erred by admitting the opinion testimony of the law director's lay witnesses. The court found that the admission of this testimony did not constitute an abuse of discretion because Ohio R. Evid. 701 permitted opinion testimony of lay witnesses if was helpful. Next, the court analyzed the municipal obscenity ordinance as incorporating the U.S. Supreme Court's Miller test. With respect to the magazines at issue, the court noted that the sellers' expert had testified that that the difference between male sophisticate magazines and explicit magazines was that the latter depicts actual penetration while the former does not. The court held that the depiction of actual penetration was not required and that the industry practice of using black dots to obscure sexual contact did not preclude a finding that the patently offense prong of the Miller test was satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, No. 87AP-9. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Lois Allenius, was a patient of appellant, Dr. Walter A. Thomas, periodically from 1968 through January 2, 1975.  On January 2, 1975, Dr. Thomas took a Pap smear from the appellee.  The results of the Pap smear indicated that Class III cells had been found which were suggestive, but not conclusive, of a malignancy.  Dr. Thomas attempted to notify appellee by mail, but the letter was returned to his office as not deliverable as addressed.  Appellee averred that Dr. Thomas made no further attempt to contact her about the laboratory results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 29, 1980, appellee had another Pap smear performed by the other appellant herein, Dr. Lloyd Barnes.  The laboratory results of this Pap smear showed Class IV cells which are strongly suggestive of malignancy.  Dr. Barnes performed a fractional D &amp; C and cervical cone biopsy on appellee on February 13, 1980.  On March 7, 1980, Dr. Barnes explained to appellee the pathology report which stated that appellee had cancer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">in situ</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee returned to Dr. Thomas on May 28, 1980, and requested that a repeat Pap smear be taken due to the result of the cone biopsy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and D &amp; C which had been performed by Dr. Barnes.  This Pap smear showed Class I, normal cells being present.  This office visit was the last time appellee saw Dr. Thomas in his professional capacity though she did visit his office in the spring of 1982 to see a copy of her records. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee continued her treatment with Dr. Barnes and had repeat Pap smears taken on June 6, 1980, December 9, 1980, May 5, 1981, November 3, 1981 and May 28, 1982.  The laboratories all reported that Class I, normal cells were present in the Pap smears. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than five months after Dr. Barnes took appellee's last Pap smear, appellee went to a non-party obstetrician/gynecologist.  A Pap smear was taken on October 12, 1982, which was reported by the laboratory as showing Class III cells.  On November 5, 1982, appellee underwent a fractional D &amp; C, cervical conization and laparoscopy which led to the diagnosis that appellee had invasive carcinoma of the cervix.  As a result of the pathology report, appellee had a hysterectomy on December 1, 1982. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29, 1983, appellee sent Dr. Thomas a one-hundred-eighty-day notification letter pursuant to R.C. 2305.11(A), stating that appellee was considering&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a medical malpractice action against him.  On March 23, 1984, Dr. Thomas stipulated an extension of the one-hundred-eighty-day letter, such extension being granted until June 27, 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about June 15, 1984, a medical expert's opinion led appellee to believe that she had a cause of action against Dr. Barnes for medical malpractice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee filed her medical malpractice complaint against Dr. Thomas and Dr. Barnes on June 27, 1984.  A motion for summary judgment was filed by appellants who claimed the action was time-barred by the statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.11(A) and (B).  Dr. Thomas raised the applicability of the four-year statute of repose of R.C. 2305.11(B) to the action filed against him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held that R.C. 2305.11(B) did not bar the action against Dr. Thomas, on the basis of this court's reasoning in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Deskins </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Young</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 8, 26 OBR 7, 496 N.E.2d 897. However, the trial court found that the filing of the complaint against Dr. Thomas and Dr. Barnes was untimely under R.C. 2305.11(A) and granted appellants' motion for summary judgment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee appealed.  Dr. Thomas cross-appealed as to the application of R.C. 2305.11(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to him.  The court of appeals reversed the summary judgment as to both doctors on the basis that the complaint was not time-barred by R.C. 2305.11(A).  That court found that the time began to run when &quot;* * * the plaintiff is aware or should be aware of the event which caused the injury and aware of the nature of the injury as a legal wrong.  * * *&quot; Furthermore, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's finding that R.C. 2305.11(B) did not bar appellee's action against Dr. Thomas. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court addressed whether the patient's alleged malpractice cause of action against the physicians was timely filed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A). Specifically, the court applied a three-prong test for determining the accrual date of the resulting injury in applying &sect; 2305.11(A). The court found that the &quot;extent and seriousness of his condition&quot; language of the test required that there be an occurrence of a cognizable event which did or should have led the patient to believe that the condition of which the patient complained was related to a medical procedure, treatment, or diagnosis previously rendered to the patient and where the cognizable event did or should have placed the patient on notice of the need to pursue his possible remedies. The court did not agree that the patient had to be aware of the full extent of the injury before there was a cognizable event. The court found that the cognizable event was when the patient learned she had invasive cancer and such should have led her to believe that follow-up treatment by the physicians, which only consisted of taking more tests, was negligently rendered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 51299. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON RECONSIDERATION. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of this case are undisputed.  In 1983, Ohio enacted the Public Employees' Collective Bargaining Act, which is codified in R.C. Chapter 4117.  The Act, which took effect on April 1, 1984, included provisions for the representation of public employees by &quot;exclusive representatives.&quot; R.C. 4117.04 and 4117.05. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Rocky River Firefighters Association, Local 695, is the exclusive representative of firefighters employed by appellant, the city of Rocky River.  In 1984, appellant and appellee commenced negotiations for the first collectively bargained employment contract between appellant and appellee's members.  When the parties failed to reach an agreement, they requested mediation assistance from appellee State Employment Relations Board (&quot;SERB&quot;) pursuant to R.C. 4117.14(C)(2). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mediation process failed to resolve the parties' disagreement on numerous issues, so the parties proceeded to the next step: submission of the issues to a fact-finding panel under R.C. 4117.14(C)(3). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The panel held a hearing and issued recommendations favoring appellant's positions on all disputed &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issues except salary, on which appellee firefighters' proposal was recommended.  Appellant exercised its option under R.C. 4117.14(C)(6)&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to reject the panel's recommendation.  This rejection triggered the conciliation requirements of R.C. 4117.14(D)(1). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After hearing testimony from the parties, the conciliator issued an order choosing appellee's final salary offer over the offer of appellant.  Appellant, even before the conciliator issued any final order, refused to recognize the validity of any such order, and commenced the instant action seeking a declaration that R.C. 4117.14(I) violates the Ohio Constitution by mandating binding arbitration between a city and its safety forces in the event of a collective bargaining impasse. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court of common pleas granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, upholding the constitutionality of R.C. 4117.14(I).

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Scioto County, No. 1583. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 10, 1984, the Scioto County Grand Jury returned an indictment against appellant, William J. Bradley, charging him with one count of aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A).  The indictment also contained two specifications which permitted the imposition of the death penalty.  The specifications were that (1) pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(4), the offense was committed while the offender was a prisoner in a detention facility; and that (2) pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), prior to the offense at bar, the offender was convicted of an offense, an essential element of which was the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges now before us stem from an incident that occurred on February 2, 1984 at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville.  On that date, appellant allegedly approached Eric Bowling, a sixty-two-year-old civilian supervisor of the institution's sheet metal shop, and beat him about the head and face with a ten-gauge bar of sheet metal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was arraigned in the Court of Common Pleas of Scioto County on March 2, 1984, at which time he entered a plea of not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guilty.  The court appointed two local attorneys, Stephen C. Rodeheffer and Joseph L. Hale, as counsel for appellant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 27, 1984, the court ordered the Shawnee Forensic Center to conduct a mental evaluation of appellant for purposes of determining his competence to stand trial.  The examiner, James R. Hagen, Ph.D., reported that though appellant was at times delusional, and had been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, appellant was nevertheless competent to stand trial.  Appellant subsequently requested an independent mental evaluation by an examiner of his own choosing.  The court, at appellant's request, appointed Dr. Ronald Litvak, who confirmed the diagnosis of chronic paranoid schizophrenia and that appellant was nonetheless competent to stand trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, on January 29, 1985, filed a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.  The court thereupon ordered Shawnee Forensic Center to conduct an evaluation of appellant for purposes of determining his mental condition at the time of the offense.  Appellant was evaluated by Dr. David Helm.  Dr. Helm concluded that, although appellant was mentally ill, it could not be definitely stated that the offense was a result of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant's mental illness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case proceeded to trial, with jury selection beginning on May 6, 1985.  The lengthy selection process finally concluded on May 13, with the jury being taken to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility to view the scene of the homicide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the trial resumed the following day, Howard McCoy, an inmate who worked in the sheet metal shop, was called to testify.  McCoy testified that he was standing at Bowling's desk reading from a list of jobs and that Bowling was standing behind him.  McCoy further testified that he heard a noise, whereupon he turned around and saw appellant hit Bowling with a steel bar.  McCoy stated that appellant continued to hit Bowling, even after Bowling had fallen to the floor.  Appellant then walked away and threw the steel bar into a pile of scrap metal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John King, another inmate assigned to the sheet metal shop, also testified.  King stated that he saw appellant &quot;whacking away at something&quot; with a piece of steel, but that he (King) could not tell what appellant was hitting because his view was obscured by filing cabinets.  When King came out from behind the cabinets, he could see Bowling lying on the floor and appellant hitting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bowling.  King summoned Corrections Sgt. Larry Smith, who found the bloody piece of steel lying twenty feet from the place of the attack. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the incident, the area was closed off by prison officials and a strip search was conducted of all inmates in the sheet metal shop.  According to Deputy Superintendent Bill Seth, this was routine prison procedure for prison incidents, designed to ensure that inmates did not possess any type of weapon that constituted a threat to institutional security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the strip search progressed, an inmate was found to have blood on his shorts and he was asked for an explanation.  At that time, appellant approached the officers conducting the search and stated that this inmate &quot;had nothing to do with this * * *.&quot; Appellant was ordered to sit down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was chosen to be the next inmate searched.  One of the officers conducting the search, Corrections Officer Richard Taylor, found blood on appellant's shirt and asked for an explanation.  Appellant pointed to where Bowling's body had been and stated that it was the foreman's blood.  Officer Taylor called the spot to the attention of Deputy Superintendent Seth, who repeated the questions to appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and received the same answers.  Officer Taylor then asked appellant, &quot;[D]id you do it?&quot; Appellant replied, &quot;[Y]eah, I did it.&quot; Appellant was then handcuffed and taken to the institution's J-Block and the strip search of the inmates continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident was turned over to the State Highway Patrol for investigation.  Sergeant Blaine Keckley testified that his examination of appellant revealed no bleeding wounds and that the blood on appellant's shirt was type &quot;O,&quot; the same blood type as that of Bowling.  State Highway Patrol District Investigator Ivan Teets interviewed appellant on the day of the incident and noticed what appeared to be speckles of blood on appellant's forehead.  After removal and analysis, the speckles were determined to be blood.  As part of the investigation, Teets compiled an extensive report.  After a minor deletion, the investigative report was marked as an exhibit and introduced as evidence without objection at trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution also produced inmate James Patterson as a witness.  Patterson had a relatively low I.Q. and was described as &quot;mildly retarded.&quot; Appellant's counsel objected, alleging that Patterson had been judicially declared incompetent. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial judge took the step of questioning the witness in chambers to determine his competency as a witness.  The trial judge believed Patterson to be competent to testify.  Once on the witness stand, Patterson indicated that the day before the incident he heard appellant tell Bowling that &quot;* * * I'm going to get you, old man.&quot; Patterson stated that appellant became angry and made this statement when Bowling told appellant he would have to do some work over. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the state presented its case, appellant testified in his own defense.  Appellant denied having harsh words with Bowling, denied striking Bowling, and stated that anyone who said otherwise was incorrect or lying.  Appellant further denied or could not recall making certain inculpatory statements to the investigating officers.  Appellant revealed on direct examination that he had an extensive record of prior convictions and incarceration.  He admitted that he had been convicted of murder and that a significant portion of his incarceration had been served at the Lima State Hospital for the criminally insane.  Following appellant's testimony, the defense rested its case. </SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that defendant failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to show a substantial violation of any of defense counsel's essential duties, and that he was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. Defendant failed to prove that there existed a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel's errors, the result of the trial would have been different.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Lake County, No. 12-027. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to R.C. 2151.313, Judge Richard A. Hoose of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, issued an order requiring the fingerprinting of a juvenile who was neither in custody nor under arrest.  The Lake County Prosecutor made the request for fingerprinting of the juvenile as a result of an investigation conducted by the Madison Fire District.  Prior to the issuance of the order, the juvenile court judge considered the affidavit and testimony of Captain Norm Chaffee of the Madison Fire District, as well as the testimony of another fire district officer, expressing their suspicion that the juvenile was involved in the placement and explosion of numerous homemade pipe bombs in the Madison, Ohio area including the local high school.  In the original order permitting the fingerprinting, the juvenile court judge did not articulate a probable cause standard. </SPAN></P>

The Court finds further that Ohio Revised Code Section 2151.313 does provide the Court with the authority to issue the fingerprint order herein albeit through language less dispositive than what the Court believes the statute was meant to provide.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Clermont County, No. CA87-03-028. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Prentice L. Guinn, was indicted on October 16, 1986, for engaging in pyramid sales in violation of R.C. 1333.92, with a specification that the compensation involved in the offense was in excess of $ 150.  Following a bench trial, appellee was found guilty of proposing a pyramid sales scheme, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, and fined $ 1,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conviction was based solely on the testimony of an undercover police officer, who stated that he arrived at the residence of a Robert Anderson on the evening of October 7, 1986 and was introduced to the appellee.  Appellee had several playing cards lying on a table in a pyramid formation, and he began to explain the &quot;airplane&quot; scheme at issue here: at the top was a &quot;pilot&quot;; the next two positions down were the &quot;co-pilots&quot;; the next four positions were the &quot;crew&quot;; and the last eight positions were &quot;passengers&quot;.  Appellee then explained that every time a participant joined, two more people had to join below him, until he reached the pilot's position.  Fifteen hundred dollars was needed to join, and that money had to be turned in by the time the participant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  made &quot;co-pilot&quot;.  This money was given to the pilot.  Thus, appellee explained, after the initial $ 1,500 was realized, the &quot;pilot&quot; would receive $ 10,500, and then &quot;move off&quot; so the next participant could collect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After appellee explained this scheme three or four times, the meeting was called to order and appellee recited from two typed pages the rules of the program, including suggestions on how to withdraw and deposit the money involved without arousing the suspicion of the Internal Revenue Service.  Appellee then broke the meeting down into smaller groups to form the individual &quot;airplanes&quot;.  The officer testified that he then signed up as a &quot;passenger&quot; on one of the pyramids, but stated that no money was exchanged at this meeting.  The officer testified that, as explained by appellee, payments were to be arranged later by the &quot;pilot&quot;.  The officer had no further conversations with appellee that night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After cross-examination of the officer, the state rested its case.  Appellee filed a Crim. R. 29 motion for acquittal, which was overruled.  Appellee then rested without presenting any testimony or evidence, and renewed his motion for acquittal.  After a short recess, the court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  entered its judgment, finding appellee guilty as charged, and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment and a fine of $ 1,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed, holding that the evidence presented was insufficient to support appellee's conviction. </SPAN></P>

Defendant had done more than explain the scheme he had offered it for the acceptance of the audience, went into detail on how much money was needed to join, how much would be returned, and how to withdraw and deposit funds to avoid the attention of the federal government, and supervised the solicitations. Defendant's speech had solicited the commission of an unlawful commercial transaction that was inherently misleading and deceptive, and therefore, was unprotected speech under U.S. Const. amend. I. Although speaking was involved, the right to prohibit unfair trade practices derived from what was being sold not how it was sold and the sales pitch that accompanied a solicitation to perform an illegal act had not made it lawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 8, 1973, Robert J. Doersam suffered a myocardial infarction while in the course and scope of his employment with Wuellner &amp; Theado, Inc.  Subsequently, he filed a workers' compensation claim and was awarded benefits for the myocardial infarction and chronic ischemic heart disease.  Doersam died on September 27, 1983, as a result of his allowed injuries.  On February 12, 1985, Doersam's surviving spouse, appellee Betty Doersam, and their daughter, Teresa, filed an application for death benefits pursuant to R.C. 4123.59(B).  On May 15, 1985, a district hearing officer determined that claimants were wholly dependent upon the decedent for support at the time of his death.  Accordingly, the hearing officer calculated that they were entitled to a death benefit of $ 214 per week, a sum that was two thirds of $ 321, the statewide average weekly wage (&quot;SAWW&quot;) for 1983 as determined pursuant to R.C. 4123.62. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Betty appealed, arguing that the SAWW used was the wrong amount.  The district officer's ruling was affirmed by the regional board of review on December 5, 1985.  The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Industrial Commission, appellant herein, affirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, appellee initiated this action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County seeking a writ of mandamus to change the amount awarded and to declare R.C. 4123.59(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional.  The court of appeals referred the matter to a referee and adopted the findings of fact of the June 19, 1987 report and recommendation, but the court rejected the referee's conclusions of law.  The court of appeals in its December 8, 1987 decision granted the requested writ and held that the classification of death benefits recipients set forth in R.C. 4123.59(B) had no rational basis and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.  The court of appeals increased the weekly benefit to one hundred percent of the SAWW. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts giving rise to the within action begin with the election of Thomas R. Battin to the office of County Commissioner of Trumbull County on November 6, 1984.  He took office on January 3, 1985 and was to serve a four-year term.  On June 6, 1985, Battin was seriously injured in an automobile accident which left him incapacitated.  It was undisputed at trial that at no time after the accident had Battin been able to, nor did he, resume his duties as a county commissioner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 5, 1985, and pursuant to former R.C. 305.03, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a physician's certificate was filed with appellee Board of Trumbull County Commissioners, which stated that Battin had been absent because of injury.  On February 14, 1986, appellee county auditor refused to give any further paychecks to Battin.  Application for a writ of mandamus was filed on February 21, 1986 in the trial court to command the auditor to issue paychecks to Battin.  After the auditor asserted that Battin lacked capacity to file the action because of mental incapacity, Karen S. Battin was appointed by the trial court as Battin's guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Also, the county&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prosecutor filed an action in quo warranto in this court, case No. 86-279, on February 25, 1986.  Later, on April 30, 1986, the prosecutor filed an application to dismiss the action, which we granted on May 5, 1986. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Former R.C. 305.03 stated as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Such vacancy shall be filled in the manner provided by section 305.02 of the Revised Code. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;Whenever any county officer is absent from the county because of sickness or injury, he shall cause to be filed with the board of county commissioners a physician's certificate of his sickness or injury.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Assembly then enacted emergency legislation which amended R.C. 305.03. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This measure was signed into law by the Governor on April 15, 1986 and was then effective.  By letter dated April 15, the county prosecutor advised the auditor that Battin's office should be deemed &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vacant and that he should be deleted from the payroll.  Appellee Trumbull County Democratic Party Central Committee announced its intention to meet on April 24, 1986 for the express purpose of appointing someone to fill the vacancy. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;The amended version of R.C. 305.03, effective April 15, 1986, states as follows: </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;(C) Whenever a county officer files a physician's certificate under division (B) of this section, but continues to be absent for an additional thirty days commencing immediately after the last day on which this certificate may be filed under division (B) of this section, his office shall be deemed vacant. </SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The original complaint in mandamus was, on April 17, 1986, supplemented to substitute Karen Battin, guardian, as party plaintiff and to include requests for a declaratory judgment as well as injunctive relief.  The declarations sought were that the amended statute was unconstitutional, or not applicable to Thomas Battin, and that the office he was elected to was not vacant.  The trial court convened hearings upon the matter on April 18 and 21 before rendering judgment on April 24.  The court found that the statute as amended was constitutional, was validly applied to declare the seat at issue vacant, and that the office had been vacated under such statute as of April 15, 1986.  Also, the court found that the guardian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ad litem</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had no standing to assert claims on behalf of Thomas Battin because the rights asserted were personal to him alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the parties, the county Democratic Party met on April 24, 1986, and the next day, its appointee, Christopher S. Lardis, was sworn in to the office declared vacant.  On that date, Karen Battin filed an application for a writ of quo warranto in the court of appeals seeking ouster of Lardis from the office to which he was appointed. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This action was ultimately stayed pending appellate review of the trial court's determinations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karen Battin filed her appeal in the instant cause on May 15, 1986.  On October 1, 1987, the court of appeals reversed the decision of the trial court.  The court found that the sole remedy available in an action questioning the right of one to hold public office was one in quo warranto.  Since this kind of action may be filed only in the court of appeals or the Supreme Court pursuant to R.C. 2733.03, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it was concluded that the trial court was without jurisdiction in the matter and the cause was remanded for dismissal of the supplemental complaint. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A commissioner was involved in an automobile accident and was incapacitated. The commissioner was not able to perform his duties since the accident. The state legislature amended Ohio Rev.

The commissioner's wife, as guardian ad litem for the commissioner, sought to oust the person who filled the &quot;vacancy&quot; of his office. The trial court found that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the action. The commissioner appealed. The court held that the &sect; 305.03 contained no express provision that it applied retrospectively. The calculation of time to determine the vacancy of the commissioner's office began upon the effective date of the &sect; 305.03. As of July 14, 1986, the commissioner had 10 days in which to file a physician's certificate which would explain his absence from the performance of his official duties for the immediately preceding 90 days. This he failed to do, and, accordingly, his office was deemed vacant as of July 14, 1986.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Summit County, No. 12664. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of August 6, 1985, Cynthia Sedgwick and three friends attended the George Thorogood concert at Blossom Music Center in Summit County.  While she was in what was described as a &quot;tipsy&quot; condition, Sedgwick wandered away from her companions several times.  Defendant-appellant, Glenn L. Benner II, also attended the concert accompanied by a group of friends, some of whom worked with him for Michael's Construction.  One of the group with appellant, Anthony J. Hoehn, testified that he saw appellant talking with a girl who was &quot;fairly drunk or high * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the concert ended, Hoehn and another member of appellant's group, Jeffrey Erhard, saw appellant walk through one of the music center's parking lots and into the adjoining woods accompanied by the girl with whom appellant had been talking earlier.  According to Erhard, appellant &quot;had his arm around her until he got to the parking lot, then he picked her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  up and carried her.&quot; Erhard testified that he and Hoehn followed appellant into the woods but could not find him.  Both Hoehn and Erhard testified that they called out for appellant in the woods, but heard no response.  Consequently, Hoehn and Erhard went home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, appellant told Robert L. Tyson, a co-worker at Michael's Construction, that &quot;he killed a girl at Blossom last night.  * * * He said he raped her and then choked her to death.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day following the Thorogood concert, Sedgwick's purse was found in the woods surrounding the Blossom Music Center.  Subsequently, on August 12, 1985, a Blossom parking lot attendant found Sedgwick's decomposed body in the woods.  A Summit County deputy sheriff who was called to the scene shortly thereafter testified that a partial pack of Winston cigarettes was found near the body.  Other testimony indicated that neither Sedgwick nor anyone in her group smoked Winston cigarettes.  Robert Tyson testified, however, that appellant smoked Winstons.  It was also testified that a knotted brassiere, a pair of socks tied together, and a tooth were found around Sedgwick's body. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 26, 1985, appellant and Robert Tyson entered the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Akron home of Nancy Hale, which was located in a neighborhood where Michael's Construction had been working.  Appellant grabbed Hale by surprise and proceeded to rape her orally, anally and vaginally.  While appellant was raping Hale, Tyson was asking for money from her.  Upon ceasing the rape, appellant began to choke Hale with his hands.  At that time, Tyson somehow got appellant to let go of Hale's neck.  Subsequently, appellant and Tyson left Hale's home.  After he was apprehended by the Akron police, appellant confessed to raping Hale. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of November 19, 1985, Shelli Powell, a University of Akron student, was jogging along Howe Road in Tallmadge, Ohio.  Suddenly, Powell was hit from behind and landed face down on the side of an embankment.  She testified that her attacker told her to &quot;shut up,&quot; not say anything and not look.  The assailant then began to wrap tape around her head, covering her eyes.  Powell stated that she was able to see her attacker's profile for around five seconds before he taped her eyes shut.  At that time, the assailant dragged Powell into the woods, whereupon he took off her shirt, brassiere, and the tape around her eyes, and began to fondle&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her.  The assailant then put his hand down her pants and stuck his fingers in her vagina.  As he stood up and began to undo his pants, Powell tried to run away.  However, the assailant pounced on her from behind and began to choke her with his hands.  Powell then became dizzy and lost consciousness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Powell regained consciousness, she was lying naked in mud.  She noticed that something was tied tightly around her neck and mouth, which impeded her breathing.  She climbed up the embankment towards Howe Road and proceeded to a house nearby for help.  Upon reaching the house, she was admitted by the occupants, who called the Tallmadge police.  The officer responding to the call aided Powell and untied the knotted brassiere that was wound tightly around her neck.  Subsequently, Powell identified the appellant as her attacker, both at trial and in an array of photographs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Tyson testified that he discussed the attack on Powell with the appellant after hearing a radio report that a &quot;Tallmadge jogger was attacked and raped.&quot; Tyson further testified that appellant admitted he was the attacker, but denied he raped her &quot;because he ran into complications.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 1, 1986, Trina&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bowser, an acquaintance of appellant who lived in the same neighborhood, was visiting her friend, Cheryl Leek.  Leek testified that Trina left her home at 9:45 p.m., stating that she wanted to go home because she was tired.  Between 12:15 and 12:20 a.m., January 2, 1986, Lincoln Skeen, Jr. was driving home from work when he found Bowser's car on fire on the Akron Expressway.  Skeen flagged down a truck to help put out the fire, and afterwards phoned Bowser's residence.  After Bowser's parents arrived on the scene, the trunk of the car was opened wherein Bowser's corpse was found.  Her ankles were bound with curtain tiebacks resembling those from appellant's new home on Butterbridge Road in Canal Fulton.  In addition, Bowser's underpants and brassiere were tied around her neck, and her jeans were wrapped around her head. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A single set of footprints in the snow was found going away from Bowser's car to a point on Southwest Avenue, just north of Newton Street.  Steven Weigand, who owned the Northeast Auto Shop at that location, testified that he had seen a pickup truck with a broken grille in his parking lot at midnight on January 2.  He further stated that at 1:20 a.m. he noticed that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the truck was gone.  Appellant's truck was later identified by Weigand as the truck he had seen that night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Summit County Coroner testified that tests indicated the presence of spermatozoa in Bowser's anus and vagina.  A criminalist employed by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation testified that appellant could have been the source of the sperm.  It was also testified that fibers and a green paint chip were found on Bowser's coat, and that fibers were found on and around her corpse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the murder of Bowser, Robert Tyson phoned the Tallmadge police, and stated that he knew the perpetrator of the murders of Sedgwick and Bowser, and of the attack on Powell.  After Tyson met with the coroner and several detectives, he told them of the Hale rape.  On January 10, 1986, both Tyson and appellant were taken into custody by Akron police.  That same day, appellant confessed to the Hale rape. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 12 and 14, 1986, police executed warrants to search appellant's residence on Broadview Road, his new home on Butterbridge Road, and his truck.  The executing officers seized clothing, vacuum sweepings, dryer lint, carpet fiber samples, and two chips&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of green paint.  On the clothing, in the dryer lint, and in the vacuum bag, blue bilobal acrylic fibers and green trilobal nylon fibers were found with the same characteristics as those fibers found on Bowser's body and coat. On some of the clothing, whit modacrylic fibers with the same characteristics as the fibers in Bowser's fake fur coat were also found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also seized at the Broadview residence were newspaper clippings about the Hale and Bowser crimes. Appellant's sister, however, testified that she had clipped the stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 21, 1986, appellant was indicted by the grand jury on twenty-two counts including the aggravated murders of Cynthia Sedgwick and Tina Bowser. For each aggravated murder, appellant was charged with felony murder ( R.C. 2903.01[B]), and with causing each death purposely and with prior calculation and design ( R.C. 2929.04[A][5]) and a felony murder specification ( R.C. 2929.04[A][7]). In addition, appellant was charged with two counts of attempted aggravated murder for the attack on Shelli Powell; two counts of attempted aggravated murder stemming from the Nancy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hale assault; six counts of rape; three counts of kidnapping; and one count each of aggravated burglary, felonious sexual penetration, gross sexual imposition, attempted rape, and aggravated arson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 23, 1986, appellant entered pleas of not guilty to all the charges. After the trial court denied appellant's motion to sever the counts, appellant waived his right to trial by jury and elected to have his case tried by a three-judge panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial commenced on April 7, 1986. During the court of the trial, the plaintiff-appellee, state of Ohio, presented the testimony of thirty witnesses and proffered over one hundred exhibits. At the close of the state's case, the trial court granted appellant's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal with respect to the counts charging prior calculation and design in the Sedgwick murder and the Hale attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was subsequently found guilty of all the remaining charges except for the second of the two counts of attempted aggravated murder stemming from the Hale assault, felonious sexual penetration in the Hale incident and aggravated arson in the Bowser death. Of importance to this appeal, appellant was convicted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the felony murder of Cynthia Sedgwick, both counts of the murder of Trina Bowser, and all the death specifications attached to those counts. As to the Bowser convictions, the prior calculation and design count was merged into the felony murder count. The court also merged the three course-of-conduct specifications of which appellant was convicted into a single aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a mitigation hearing was held, the appellant was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction and sentence. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with four crimes, two of which involved the murder and sexual assault of the victims. The trial court refused to grant a severance, found defendant guilty, and imposed two death sentences. The Court of Appeals of Summit County (Ohio) affirmed the convictions and the death penalty, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The prosecution tried defendant on four similar crimes and introduced gruesome photographs of the first victim's decomposing body. The evidence disclosed that a second murder victim also was strangled. The second victim was raped anally and vaginally and left in the trunk of a car with her ankles bound and her undergarments tied around her neck. Shortly after the murders, a witness gave the police information that linked defendant to the crimes. The police arrested defendant, and two police officers questioned him. Defendant did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights until a later date. The court held that (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the severance because the evidence would have been admissible in separate trials, (2) the improper admission of evidence was harmless error in light of defendant's confession to one of the crimes, a victim's identification of defendant as her assailant, and a witness's testimony that he saw defendant rape one victim, and (3) the aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, so the death sentences were appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and defendant's convictions and the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Ashtabula County, No. 1322. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Ashtabula County Medical Center (&quot;ACMC&quot;), operates a general hospital located in Ashtabula, Ohio.  The Ohio Nurses Association (&quot;ONA&quot;) is the exclusive bargaining representative of the registered nurses employed at the hospital.  In July 1980, the ONA went on strike, and the ACMC responded by closing the facility, thereby laying off all remaining employees of the hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants are one hundred eighty-five </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> non-union employees who were laid off by the hospital and who subsequently filed timely applications for unemployment compensation.  The Administrator of the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services (&quot;OBES&quot;) denied their claims and, with certain exceptions, timely requests for reconsideration were made and the requests were certified as appeals to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (&quot;board&quot;).  The appeals were consolidated by the board pursuant to Ohio Adm. Code 4146-7-02(E), and a hearing was held before a referee for and on behalf of the board on March 22, 1984.  The board in nine separate opinions affirmed the denial of appellants' claims on October 16, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1984. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;There is evidently some confusion about how many appellants there are in this case.  In their brief, appellants refer to themselves as &quot;one hundred and eighty-four non-union affiliated individuals.&quot; ACMC, on the other hand, throughout its brief refers to &quot;176 claimants.&quot; The court of common pleas characterized the appeal from the board's decisions as &quot;taken on behalf of the 176 claimants,&quot; and, citing R.C. 4141.28(P), the court concluded that the appellants therein were &quot;the 176 claimants.&quot; The court of appeals also viewed appellants as &quot;[o]ne hundred seventy-six of the laid off employees.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">From our review of the record we count, as does the administrator, one hundred eighty-five claimants.  In its decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">In re Claim of McConnell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> (Oct. 16, 1984), No. 609558-M-BR, the board listed one hundred seventy-six individuals to whom the decision applies.  The record also contains eight separate decisions by the board, each addressing an individual claim not included in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">McConnell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> decision.  The &quot;Notice of Appeal and Class Action Complaint&quot; filed in the court of common pleas listed forty-one claimants: thirty-two appealing from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">McConnell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> decision; eight appealing from the board decision specifically addressing their claim; and one, Vera Valitsky, appealing from an earlier decision of the board dated April 10, 1984, dismissing her claim for failure to appear at the March 22, 1984 hearing.  Thus, one hundred forty-four of the claimants affected by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">McConnell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> decision were not individually listed as appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The board's rulings were appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Ashtabula County pursuant to R.C. 4141.28(O) and 4141.28(P).  The single appeal, captioned &quot;Notice of Appeal and Class Action Complaint,&quot; was filed by forty-one named appellants on their own behalf and purportedly on behalf of &quot;all other[s] similarly situated.&quot; ACMC's motion to strike the appeal as to the appellants not listed was denied.  The trial court granted appellants' motion for summary judgment on the merits, reversing and vacating the board's prior rulings.  The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, modifying the trial court's order to apply only to the forty-one named appellants. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, Nos. 86AP-1132, 86AP-1162 and 86AP-1163. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 7, 1986, Franklin County Deputy Sheriff Ernest Cook visited the premises of the Fraternal Order of Eagles (&quot;FOE&quot;) Post 3261 in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.  Prior to this visit Detective Cook had received information from an informant that gambling activities were being conducted at the Reynoldsburg Post.  This informant was a member of the FOE.  She had been a reliable source of information for Cook in the past, and on May 7, 1986, she accompanied Cook to the Reynoldsburg post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The informant had her FOE credentials in hand and presented them to the doorkeeper, though the doorkeeper apparently never asked to see them.  The informant was permitted to enter the premises, and Cook was allowed to accompany her as her guest.  Once inside, Cook and the informant ordered drinks and observed the alleged gambling activity, which consisted of the use of electronic draw poker machines and instant win tickets.  Cook himself engaged in these activities.  As a result of his observations, Cook obtained a warrant to search the premises on May 9, 1986.  A search pursuant to the warrant was conducted on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that date. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 2, 1986, appellants, Jesse Posey, Sr., Fraternal Order of Eagles Post 3261, and Sharon Parker, were charged with violating R.C. 2915.02.  Appellants each filed a motion to suppress the evidence.  Appellants also each filed a motion to dismiss the charges on statutory and constitutional grounds.  The trial court overruled the motions to suppress on December 12, 1986, finding that Cook's entry into the lodge was lawful and that anything he observed in plain view was admissible.  However, the court did grant appellants' motions to dismiss the charges on two grounds: that the state could not demonstrate that the gambling was for profit; and that the statute's exemption from prosecution of certain charitable organizations, but not the FOE, denied the FOE equal protection of the laws.  Both decisions were appealed to the court of appeals, which on July 28, 1987, affirmed the denial of the motions to suppress, but reversed the dismissals and remanded the cases for trial. </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2915.02; (2) application of &sect; 2915.02 to the fraternal organization was consistent with the equal protection guarantees of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions in light of certain exemptions from prosecution granted to other purely charitable institutions by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.02(D); and (3) the evidence seized was admissible notwithstanding that the seizure, while made pursuant to a warrant, was preceded by a warrantless entry into the premises because that entry was not deceptive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 16, 1985, Mary A. Mitchell was fatally shot during a robbery which occurred while she was working as a clerk in a Lawson Milk Company store.  James L. Mitchell, administrator of her estate and appellee herein, filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County on August 14, 1986.  He alleged that Lawson had committed an intentional tort by failing to provide adequate security or training in handling violent situations.  Lawson responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Civ. R. 12(B)(6). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Appellant also argued that the complaint was barred by R.C. 4121.80(A), effective August 22, 1986, which provides that actions which allege the commission of an intentional tort by an employer must be brought within one year of the employee's death or alleged injury.  The court of common pleas held and the court of appeals affirmed that application to the cause herein of the statute of limitations contained in R.C. 4121.80(A) would be unconstitutional because appellee would be denied a reasonable time after the effective date of the statute in which to bring the claim.  We need not decide the merits of this argument due to our decision that even if the complaint were timely filed, it must be dismissed pursuant to Civ. R. 12(B)(6).</SPAN></P>

In order to establish an intentional tort, the estate administrator must have shown proof beyond that required to establish negligence and beyond that required to establish recklessness. The complaint concluded that the employer knew or should have known that its employees were subject to armed robberies and other violent acts. The court held that the intentional tort claim against the employer would be dismissed unless the complaint alleged facts showing that the employer specifically desired to injure the employee or knew that injury to the employee was certain or substantially certain to result from the employer's act and despite this knowledge, still proceeded. Given the facts pleaded in the complaint, the court concluded that it was not possible for the estate administrator to prove an intentional tort.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1982, defendant Toledo Board of Education (hereinafter &quot;the board&quot;) and appellant, Toledo Federation of Teachers (hereinafter &quot;TFT&quot;), entered into a collective bargaining agreement which contained an &quot;[a]gency [s]hop&quot; provision.  This provision required that teaching employees either become members of TFT or, if membership was not desired, share in the financial support of TFT by paying a service fee not to exceed the amount of dues paid by members.  Thus, each teacher was required to pay a &quot;fair share&quot; of collective bargaining costs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees are teachers employed by the board who are not members of TFT.  These teachers opposed the requirement that they pay the service fees to TFT from the inception of the collective bargaining agreement.  TFT filed an action to enforce payment.

This decision was subsequently upheld on appeal. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The board notified the appellees on September 8, 1983, that it would deduct the fees from each of the appellees' payroll checks, to be paid to TFT on an installment basis. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

Thereafter, all service fees paid by appellees to TFT were placed in escrow pursuant to a court order filed on October 13, 1983.  On April 1, 1984, R.C. Chapter 4117, the Public Employees' Collective Bargaining Act, became effective.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the procedures used by the union to refund nonmember employee service fees and resolve disputes concerning the validity of the rebates were unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 1, 1983, appellant, Billy Joe Sowell, visited the apartment of his friend, Calvert Graham, who lived down the hall from appellant in a Cincinnati apartment building.  Appellant later left the apartment in the company of Pamela Jean Billups, who had been visiting Graham and his friend Donna Edwards.  Appellant took Billups to dinner and, afterwards, they went to a hotel and rented a room.  There was conflicting testimony as to what transpired there, but it is undisputed that appellant eventually passed out under the influence of marijuana and alcohol that he had consumed that evening.  Appellant bought breakfast for Billups the following morning and went home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days later, on May 4, appellant saw Billups as they passed each other in a store doorway.  Neither person acknowledged the other.  On his way home that evening, appellant claims he drank at least one double shot of vodka at each of five taverns.  He then proceeded to Graham's apartment where he allegedly consumed more alcohol and a marijuana cigarette with Graham, Billups, and Edwards. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant testified that he then fell asleep for a short&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  time only to awaken and find $ 190 missing from his pocket.  He became enraged when Graham, Billups, and Edwards claimed ignorance of the funds.  Billups testified that appellant also accused her of stealing money from him on the night they were at the hotel.  Graham subsequently ordered appellant to leave his apartment.  Appellant then announced his intention to get his gun to shoot Billups, and he returned to his own apartment for several minutes, where he instructed his alleged common-law wife, Lenora Waugh, to bring him his .38 caliber pistol.  He and Waugh then walked down the hall to Graham's apartment.  Appellant told Waugh to knock on the door and identify herself as someone named &quot;Portia.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billups and Edwards testified that when Graham opened the door, appellant forced his way into the apartment.  He then fired a shot into the ceiling and said that he intended to shoot Billups.  Graham managed to calm appellant down somewhat and began escorting him to the door.  At this time, appellant suddenly turned and shot Graham in the abdomen.  As Graham fell, appellant fired another shot into Graham's head, killing him.  Appellant claimed that he did not draw and shoot his gun until&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Graham threatened him with a knife. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant then searched for Billups and found her hiding in a closet.  He shot her three times and then put the gun to her head and pulled the trigger.  However, the gun failed to fire because he had expended all its ammunition.  Appellant returned to his apartment, ordered Waugh to hide the gun and give him some money, and then left the premises.  As he left the building he threatened to shoot Edwards if she fled before he did.  Appellant was subsequently arrested at a nearby tavern. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted for aggravated murder with a death penalty specification pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), that the killing of Graham was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of Graham and the attempt to kill Billups.  He was also indicted for the attempted aggravated murder of Pam Billups.  Appellant entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity, and was subsequently found competent to stand trial.  He then waived his right to a jury trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A three-judge panel found appellant guilty as charged and sentenced him to death for the aggravated murder of Graham, and to a term of seven to twenty-five years for the attempted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  aggravated murder of Billups.  The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences with one judge dissenting only with respect to the court's approval of the death sentence. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was established at trial that on the evening of February 18, 1985, Robert Van Hook, appellant herein, went to a downtown Cincinnati establishment called the Subway Bar.  There, he approached David Self.  The two engaged in conversation while consuming alcoholic beverages for approximately two to three hours.  As they left together, Self stopped briefly to explain to the bartender that he and appellant were planning to go to Self's apartment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the apartment, appellant lured Self into a vulnerable position and, with no provocation, attacked him.  Initially, appellant strangled Self into a state of unconsciousness.  He then took a paring knife from the victim's kitchen and stabbed the victim behind the right ear, aiming the thrust upward toward the brain, accompanied by a blade-twisting movement.  Appellant then stabbed the victim's neck in numerous places, each stab wound accompanied by cutting motions.  Several of these wounds penetrated over halfway through the neck and apparently represented appellant's efforts to decapitate the victim.  Appellant then made an incision on the victim's body from the abdomen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  up to and over the sternum.  The victim's abdominal cavity was opened so that his liver was visible.  Appellant then stabbed upward a number of times, penetrating the liver and eventually penetrating the abdominal wall into the heart in three places.  He placed a small bottle which had contained amyl nitrate, its cap, a cigarette butt and the paring knife into the victim's abdominal cavity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant then searched much of the apartment including a chest of drawers and a jewelry box.  There was evidence that particular items of jewelry were taken, including specific testimony that the victim's gold chain necklace, which he had worn into the bar earlier that evening, was missing.  Thereafter, appellant looked into the victim's refrigerator for food, but not seeing anything that &quot;[he] liked,&quot; he prepared his departure from the apartment.  Such preparation included smearing his bloody fingerprints, and turning up the volume on the stereo system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaving the apartment, appellant went to the home of Dr. Robert Hoy, a family friend.  There, under the guise of recovering from a fight with his stepfather, appellant borrowed money and ate a large meal.  He then left and eventually arrived&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  There, he evaded detection until April 1, 1985, when, pursuant to information given by appellant's family, he was arrested by the Oakland Park police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, appellant was indicted for the offenses of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01 and aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01.  A specification was also contained in the indictment that appellant committed the aggravated murder during the course of an aggravated robbery and that he was the principal offender.  R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).  Appellant pled not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant waived his right to a trial by jury, electing to be tried instead by a three-judge panel.  Appellant was found guilty of both charges as well as the aggravating circumstances specified.  Following the sentencing phase, the three-judge panel, for the reasons set forth in its opinion filed pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(F), imposed the sentence of death upon appellant for the crime of aggravated murder and also imposed a concurrent indefinite term of ten to twenty-five years for the crime of aggravated robbery.  The court of appeals, having performed its statutory independent analysis&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the record and the proportionality of the sentence, affirmed the sentence in all particulars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court pursuant to an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty of both charges as well as the aggravating circumstances and was sentenced to death. The court of appeals upheld the sentence and on appeal, the conviction and sentence were affirmed. Defendant's confession to the police, which included an admission to the killing and the robbery, was properly admitted because the record demonstrated that defendant himself reinitiated his own interrogation. Further, the evidence establishing deadly force and a deadly weapon constituted evidence that the victim had been robbed as well as murdered and, accordingly, was sufficient to firmly establish the corpus delicti predicate for admission of the confession. Finally, the trial court was justified in refusing to find the existence of mitigating factors under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B)(3), given defendant's failure to establish mental disease, the finding that defendant was not impaired in his ability to distinguish right from wrong, and the scant evidence offered in mitigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Warren County, No. CA86-07-050. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject of this appeal is the legality of the proposed annexation by the city of Franklin of two sections of Cincinnati-Dayton Road in Warren County.  The first section of roadway (hereinafter &quot;the northern territory&quot;) connects two areas of the city of Franklin.  The second section (hereinafter &quot;the southern territory&quot;) runs parallel to the boundary of the city of Franklin for about eighteen hundred feet and then continues outward into Franklin Township.  These two sections of the county highway's right-of-way total 3.8 miles in length and are eighty feet wide at all points.  (See appended map.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[SEE ILLUSTRATION IN ORIGINAL] </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 5, 1985, the Franklin City Council adopted Ordinance 1985-19, which authorized proceedings to annex the territory in question.  A petition for annexation was filed with the Board of County Commissioners for Warren County (hereinafter &quot;the board&quot;).  On November 5, 1985, the electors of the unincorporated areas of Franklin Township approved the issue.  Following a public hearing on January 30, 1986, the board adopted Resolution 86-63, thereby approving the petition for annexation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thereafter, the city of Middletown, Donald Easterly, Byron R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The city of Franklin and the Franklin residents had adopted a resolution for the annexation into the city of Middletown. The city of Middletown and the Middletown residents opposed the annexation by filing an injunction to prevent the annexation.

On appeal, the court held that the city of Middletown and the Middletown residents had proven by clear and convincing evidence their right to an injunction under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.07. One of the Middletown residents' legal interest in his property within the territory to be annexed could be adversely affected because he did not have a desire to have his property located within the city of Franklin. The city of Middletown's legal rights could be adversely affected by the annexation because its right under a contract with Warren County to service and maintain water located within a portion of the subject territory could be impaired. The court concluded that the city of Franklin had erred to the prejudice of the city of Middletown and the Middletown residents when it found the annexation was good for the territory at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County, No. 51299. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1983 the General Assembly adopted new R.C. Chapter 4117, the Ohio Public Employees' Collective Bargaining Act, which established the procedures for the representation of public employees by labor unions.  R.C. 4117.14(D)(1), in particular, provides for dispute settlement between the exclusive representative of public safety employees and a public employer.  After the exclusive representative and the public employer have failed to reach an agreement and have engaged in fact-finding, the dispute is to be submitted to a conciliator, in effect an arbitrator, for final offer binding arbitration.  R.C. 4117.14(I) mandates that the issuance of a final offer settlement award be binding upon the parties to the dispute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After this section of the Act became effective in 1984, appellant, the city of Rocky River, recognized the Rocky River Firefighters (IAFF), Local 695 (&quot;the union&quot;) as the exclusive representative of fire fighters in the city and bargained with it with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.  Following an impasse over the issue of wages, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the city and the union participated in fact-finding, the first stage of the dispute-resolution process.  The city rejected the fact-finder's report, triggering the binding final offer arbitration provision of the Act's dispute-resolution &quot;conciliation&quot; mechanism.  The city agreed to proceed with the conciliation process, but stated in advance that it would not be bound by the &quot;binding mandate,&quot; whether favorable or unfavorable, because of the constitutional infirmities of R.C. 4117.14(I).  The conciliator issued an award on February 21, 1985, adopting the union's position, which became a &quot;binding mandate&quot; under the Act.  Subsequently, on March 14, 1985, the city and the union reached an agreement providing for wages and wage adjustments during this litigation and, if appropriate, upon the conclusion thereof. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the conciliator's award, however, on February 6, 1985, Rocky River filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a judgment that R.C. 4117.14(I) violates the Ohio Constitution by mandating binding arbitration for collective bargaining disputes between the exclusive representative of safety employees and municipal employers.  Appellees, the State Employment Relations Board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (&quot;SERB&quot;), and the Rocky River Firefighters (IAFF), Local 695 filed motions for summary judgment seeking to uphold the constitutionality of R.C. 4117.14(I). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rocky River responded with its cross-motion for summary judgment challenging the constitutionality of R.C. 4117.14(I) as a violation of the city's home-rule powers and as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.  The trial court granted appellees' motions and denied the city's cross-motion.  The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision. </SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County upheld the constitutionality of the statute and the city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The issue of first impression presented in this case was whether Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4117.14(I), which mandated binding arbitration for collective bargaining disputes between the exclusive representatives of municipal safety forces and a municipal employer, was unconstitutional to the extent that it violated the city's power. Appellant city challenged &sect; 4117.14(I) as a violation of its power of local self-government, usurping its power to set the wages of its safety forces. Appellees, the state employment relations board and the local firefighters union, maintained that &sect; 4117.14(I) was enacted by the General Assembly for the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the state and applicable to municipalities. The state employment relations board and the local firefighters union further argued that &sect; 4117.14(I) manifested a statewide concern for the integrity of the collective bargaining process in the public sector. The court held that &sect; 4117.14(I) was unconstitutional to the extent that it violated a municipality's right to exercise power of local self-government and because it interfered with the municipality's power to determine municipal safety employee compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court had earlier held that the provision for mandatory binding arbitration of collective bargaining disputes over municipal safety-employee benefits and wages, Ohio Rev.

However, with the exception of its arguments concerning the Act's mandatory binding arbitration provisions, the city had not met the burden of overcoming this presumption of constitutionality of the Act.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Allen County, Nos. 1-86-17 and 1-86-18. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Jimmie Jacobs, was employed as a foundry worker by appellee, Teledyne, Inc. (hereinafter &quot;Teledyne&quot;), from 1943 until 1983.  In August 1972, appellant filed a workers' compensation claim alleging that he had contracted the occupational disease of silicosis as a result of exposure to silica dust in the course of his employment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 7, 1973, following a hearing on the claim, a deputy administrator of the Industrial Commission rendered a decision which stated: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Administrator finds that although proof of record shows that the claimant has contracted the disease of silicosis the same has not caused total disability within eight (8) years after his last injurious exposure; it is, therefore found that under the provisions of O.R.C. 4123.68 no benefits or compensation can be paid at this time in this claim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claim uncertified.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was also stamped with the words: &quot;Bureau of Workmen's Compensation APPROVED CLAIM.&quot; This decision was not appealed by any party and no further proceedings were held on this matter at that time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1984, appellant filed a new claim and again&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alleged that he had contracted silicosis in the course of his employment.  The new claim made specific reference to and incorporated the application filed in August 1972.  A district hearing officer considered appellant's 1984 claim for benefits and construed it to be an application to reactivate the 1972 claim. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hearing officer denied the new claim and stated in part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claim OD-21497-22 is disallowed as a new claim as the record is clear that the claimant has a previous claim for the same condition with the same employer and that that claim is OD-9957-22.  Hence, claimant's application filed in claim OD-21497-22 is to be deemed as an application to reactivate the claim in OD-9957-22.  As such, the application must be denied in that more than six years has elapsed in claim OD-9957-22 and there has been no payment of compensation so as to continue the jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission under 4123.52 of the Ohio Revised Code.  The findings of the Deputy Administrator as previously cited is [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] a finding as to the claimant's right topparticipate [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] in that it does find that the claimant has contracted the condition of silicosis in the course of and arising &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out of his employment.  That finding is also a finding as to the claim-ant's [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] extent of disability in that is [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] is found that the claimant has not suffered total disability within eight years of the last injurious exposure.  In that claimant's right to participate was determined as of 11-7-73, at least, and in that more than six years has elapsed without the payment of compensation for the condition of silicosis, Claim OD 9957-22 is no longer a claim within the continuing jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission of Ohio * * *. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a point of clarification OD-21497-22 is not a newly compensable claim for the reason that the claimant had a pre-existing condition specifically allowed in the prior claim.

He refiled in 1984 after becoming disabled but the claim was denied by appellee Industrial Commission because more than six years had passed since the 1972 filing. When summary judgment was granted to appellee employer on review and affirmed by the Court of Appeals for Allen County (Ohio), the worker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">A worker's 1972 claim resulted in his silicosis being recognized. However, no compensation was paid because he was not disabled. His 1984 claim, made when he became disabled, was deemed a reactivation of the old claim. Because more than six years had passed, the claim was found to be no longer viable. After being denied administrative relief, the worker appealed the 1972 and 1984 orders, but the trial court ruled for the employer and the commission. The worker appealed and the court reversed and remanded. It rejected the argument that res judicata barred the claim. Finding that the worker had filed the 1972 claim only to avoid a statute of limitations issue, the court found that the earlier claim had served no purpose because the worker was not disabled when he filed it and thus could not receive any compensation. However, he was totally disabled when he filed the 1984 claim. This factual difference alone was significant enough to prevent res judicata from applying to bar the claim, and the court so ruled. The court also found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.52 was not applicable to an occupational disease like silicosis, as it was not an &quot;injury&quot; within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed lower court orders holding that the worker's claims were barred by res judicata and remanded to the commission for further proceedings on the worker's 1984 claim for compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-840850. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 17, 1984, Daniel Lee Bedford, appellant herein, was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.01(A).  Both counts alleged that Bedford purposely and with prior calculation and design caused the death of another.  Each count was accompanied by the specification that the murder was committed as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons.  R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday, April 24, 1984, Bedford telephoned the apartment shared by his ex-girlfriend, Gwen Toepfert, and Jo Ann Funk.  Bedford asked to speak with Toepfert.  Funk refused to awaken Toepfert, although she reluctantly told Bedford that both Toepfert and her boyfriend, John Smith, were at the apartment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems Bedford had attempted to speak with Toepfert because he had been hoping for some time to rekindle a prior romance.  On the prior Saturday, he came to the apartment to deliver a plant to Toepfert but discovered her new boyfriend there.  Bedford became very upset and departed after giving the plant to Toepfert. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that Tuesday morning, Jo Ann Funk was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  awakened by gunshots and screams.  Toepfert ran into Funk's bedroom, crying that she had been shot.  After Funk attempted to phone for help, Bedford entered the room and shot Toepfert as she lay on the floor. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bedford did not shoot Funk, although she heard the .38 caliber revolver click after Bedford shot her roommate. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;It is not entirely clear how Bedford gained access to the apartment.  Bedford told an examining psychologist that he had hidden in the laundry room of the apartment building to avoid being seen prior to gaining entrance to the apartment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bedford left the bedroom and Funk followed him into the living room.  She saw Bedford with a shotgun.  He was looking behind the open front door and yelling, &quot;Come out, mother-fucker.&quot; Outside the building, Smith's body lay on the landing of the front steps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funk ran to the bathroom and slammed the door.  During that time, she heard a loud shot fired.  Bedford then left the apartment.  Upon coming out of the bathroom, Funk noticed that Toepfert had sustained a shotgun blast to the lower abdomen, in the pelvic region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bedford fled to Tennessee.  While there, he visited an acquaintance from his boyhood days, Jimmy Joe Pennington. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later that same Tuesday evening, Pennington asked why Bedford looked troubled and Bedford replied that he had killed two people.  Pennington told a store clerk to phone the police and, although Bedford guessed that Pennington had turned him in, Bedford waited for the arrival of the authorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arriving, a deputy sheriff asked Bedford if the police could help him.  He replied that he had killed two people in Cincinnati earlier in the day.  Appellant was frisked, given his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, and taken to jail.  Bedford again received his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights, signed a waiver, and gave police an inculpatory statement.  He later gave Cincinnati authorities a similar inculpatory statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, Bedford attempted to establish that he was extremely upset and depressed due to the break-up with his girlfriend and that he was intoxicated when he went to her apartment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His statement indicated that he shot Smith after Smith wrestled away the shotgun and that he would not have killed either victim if Smith had not wrestled the shotgun from him. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;There was no evidence corroborating Bedford's intoxication claim.  Funk testified to the effect that he did not seem intoxicated either on the telephone or when he was at the apartment.  Pennington testified that, while Bedford appeared very tired, Bedford did not seem to be intoxicated.  Finally, the police testified that Bedford did not appear intoxicated.  There was testimony that Bedford made the early morning call from a bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A jury convicted Bedford on one count of aggravated murder (Toepfert) with a specification and one count of murder (Smith).  This same jury, after hearing the evidence of mitigating factors, recommended that defendant be sentenced to death.  The trial court, in its separate findings of fact and opinion, concurred and sentenced Bedford to death.  After conducting an independent review, the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County affirmed the conviction and death sentence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  <BR>Ohio v. Bedford, 1986 Ohio App. LEXIS 8608 (Ohio Ct. App., Oct. 8, 1986)</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he was prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct, that he was denied an impartial jury, and that the death penalty was improperly imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant entered the apartment of the first victim, his ex-girlfriend, where she was with the second victim, her current boyfriend. The first victim's roommate was awakened by the sound of gunshots and screams and observed defendant shoot the first victim and pursue the second victim. Defendant had learned that the victims were together in the apartment when he telephoned earlier on the day of the homicides. The trial court dismissed two jurors for cause because they indicated that they could not impose the death penalty. Defendant claimed that he was intoxicated and under stress when he shot the victims. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, finding first that the trial court properly dismissed the jurors for cause because they could not have properly fulfilled their obligations as jurors. The court determined that the death penalty was properly imposed, reasoning that defendant's emotional stress, personal problems, and hardships in life did not mitigate the circumstances of the murders. The court noted that there was no evidence that defendant was unable to distinguish right from wrong or that the victims induced or facilitated the crimes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 4:00 p.m. on October 4, 1982, Margaret Annette Cooper, a.k.a. Margaret Annette Johnston, and Todd Leroy Schultz, her fiancee, left the Schultz family home in Logan, Ohio.  They did not return. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 14, 1982, two nude and decomposing human torsos were discovered in the Hocking River near the city's edge.  Two days later, the arms, legs, and heads of Annette and Todd were found buried in a cornfield adjacent to the river. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims had been shot several times with a .22 caliber weapon and dismembered with a sharp instrument.  Expert testimony established that the victims had been killed on or about October 4.  Various kinds of circumstantial evidence linked Annette's stepfather, Dale N. Johnston, to the crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29, 1983, an indictment was issued charging Dale N. Johnston, appellee herein, with two counts of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01.  The indictment contained death penalty specifications charging that the murders were a part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, as provided in R.C. 2929.04(A)(2). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee waived&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  his right to a jury trial, and the case was tried before a three-judge panel.

Following a mitigation hearing, the panel sentenced appellee to death on March 27, 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 6, 1984, appellee filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Crim. R. 33(A)(6), citing newly discovered evidence.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 6, 1986, the court of appeals unanimously reversed appellee's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial.  In case No. 412 (Supreme Court No. 86-1547), the appellate court found that the trial court had erred in admitting the testimony of a witness who had been hypnotized and in issuing an opinion without findings and reasons for its conclusion at the sentencing phase.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Lucas County, No. L-84-225. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 9:30 p.m. on February 12, 1983, a man entered the Island Variety Carryout in Toledo, Ohio, wearing a green ski mask and a dark blue jacket.  The victim, Melanie Gerschultz, and James Barrailloux, both store employees, were the only other persons present and were standing in the back of the store as the man entered.  The man approached the pair, pointed a small black handgun at them and ordered one of them to open the cash register at the front of the store.  Gerschultz complied and walked towards the cash register.  As she opened the register, Barrailloux crouched down and left the store through the rear door, entering the attached home of the store owner, Evelyn Krieger.  While he was alerting Krieger of the robbery, they heard a gunshot.  Barrailloux and Krieger re-entered the store to find Gerschultz lying on the floor with a fatal gunshot wound in her neck.  The cash register was open and approximately $ 110 was missing.  A small round hole was found in the sheet of clear Plexiglas located to the side of the cash register, through which the bullet had apparently passed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 13, 1983, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant, Gregory Esparza, was indicted on the following two counts: (1) aggravated murder while in the commission of an aggravated robbery, to which a firearm specification and a specification of committing the aggravated murder while committing aggravated robbery were attached; and (2) aggravated robbery, to which a firearm specification was attached.  Appellant pleaded not guilty to each count and specification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was impaneled on May 4, 1984.  At trial, appellant's sister and a fellow inmate, Albert Richardson, testified that appellant had independently told each of them that he had robbed the carryout and had shot a woman. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts and all specifications charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant requested a presentence investigation and a mental examination, pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1), which were granted.  However, his contemporaneous request for appointment of an independent psychologist to perform the examination, pursuant to R.C. 2929.024, was denied.  The jury, following the hearing on mitigation, recommended that appellant be sentenced to death.  The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and additionally sentenced appellant to serve&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seven to twenty-five years' imprisonment for aggravated robbery, plus three years on the firearm specification.  The court of appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with aggravated murder while in the commission of an aggravated robbery and aggravated robbery; firearm specifications were attached to both charges. The Court of Appeals for Lucas County (Ohio) denied defendant's request for appointment of an independent psychologist, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.024. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his request under &sect; 2929.024 for an independent psychologist to perform his mental examination. The court held that the trial court did not err because defendant was not entitled to the psychologist of his own choosing under &sect; 2929.024. Moreover, the trial court properly determined that such an examination was not reasonably necessary for the proper representation of defendant at the sentencing hearing. Next, the court held that defendant was not entitled to complain of the submission to the jury of a presentence investigation report because he had requested the report, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(D)(1). The court held that defendant was not denied his right to place all relevant evidence before the sentencing jury because the letter to his former foster family, which defendant used to illustrate ties to the community and which was written three weeks prior to trial, lacked trustworthiness. The State did not unconstitutionally exercise its preemptory challenges as jurors who had some reservations about the death penalty were not an &quot;identifiable group&quot; for the purposes of an Equal Protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our review of this case is statutorily mandated because a sentence of death was imposed upon appellant, Jerome Henderson, for his conviction of the aggravated murder of Mary Acoff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 10:45 p.m., March 2, 1985, Acoff left her basement-level apartment at 1944 Highland Avenue in Cincinnati and went to the apartment of her boyfriend, James Martin, who lived in the same building.  Martin and Acoff engaged in sexual intercourse.  Acoff left around midnight and returned to her apartment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Nixon, who lived in the apartment above Acoff, testified that around 4:50 a.m. on March 3, 1985, he heard sounds &quot;like a commotion&quot; coming from below.  After Nixon stepped into the hallway of the building to await his ride to work he heard a downstairs door open.  However, he did not see anyone downstairs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Turner testified that as she drove toward the building about 6:00 a.m. to pick up Nixon, she saw appellant standing on the street a little way up from the building.  She stated that appellant was wearing a dark, knee-length coat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delrick Johnson testified that as he approached the Highland Avenue area around 5:30&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a.m., he saw appellant, whom he knew from school.  Johnson honked his horn at appellant, who responded by pulling his coat up around his ears.  Johnson stated that appellant was wearing a long leather coat with a shorter coat underneath. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 4:15 p.m., March 3, 1985, ten-year-old Joann Acoff, Mary Acoff's daughter, and Sandra Simmons, a neighbor, found Acoff's body on the living room floor of the apartment.  The front door was unlatched and a kitchen window was closed but unlocked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police found latent fingerprints, mud on the kitchen and living room floors, and bloodstains on the outside kitchen windowsill.  A bloodstained rock and fallen leaf were found on the ground outside the kitchen window.  The ground beneath the kitchen window was muddy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acoff died as a result of hemorrhage due to multiple stab, incised and blunt injuries to the head, chest, neck and upper extremities.  In addition to at least four fatal stab wounds, Acoff had been cut with the point of a sharp knife numerous times and her throat had been slashed at least thirteen times.  Acoff's left hand had been cut and was wrapped in a towel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acoff's body was found nude, lying face up with legs spread apart.  &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Semen was found in her vagina.  The deputy coroner testified that the general pattern of bloodstains over the upper torso indicated that Acoff was killed while she was lying in a horizontal position. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front door of the apartment building was kept locked.  To gain entry without a key, one had to ring the doorbell of an apartment and have the occupant open the front door.  On the day of the murder, Acoff's doorbell was not working. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently nothing was stolen from the apartment: Acoff's purse was undisturbed, a gold chain was found lying in a pool of blood on the floor and the stereo and television set were in place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon learning of appellant's presence in the neighborhood, police called him and he went to the police station to be interviewed.  Appellant denied being in the vicinity of Acoff's apartment at the time of the murder.  He was permitted to leave the police station. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly thereafter, police were told that a latent fingerprint lifted from the kitchen wall of Acoff's apartment had been identified as appellant's.  Police arrested appellant and informed him of the fingerprint, but appellant insisted that he had never been inside Acoff's apartment and that he did not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  know her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police searched appellant's residence pursuant to a warrant and seized a damp pair of gym shoes, a long black leather coat, a short black leather jacket, and an eight-inch paring knife discovered inside the pocket of the jacket.  The soles of the shoes contained human blood but in an insufficient amount to determine its type.  A bloody shoeprint from the floor of Acoff's apartment was consistent with the characteristics of the soles of the seized gym shoes.  Bloodstains found on the coat were consistent with Acoff's blood type (type AB) and inconsistent with appellant's (type O).  A piece of unidentifiable human tissue was discovered on the long coat.  Semen stains, consistent with a type O secretor, were also found on the coat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rock found outside the kitchen window was stained with type AB blood and the fallen leaf with human blood, type unknown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was charged with two counts of aggravated murder with specifications that: (1) appellant, as the principal offender, purposely caused Acoff's death while committing or attempting to commit aggravated burglary; and (2) appellant, as the principal offender, purposely caused Acoff's death while committing or attempting&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to commit rape.  The third and fourth counts charged appellant with aggravated burglary and rape. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant pled not guilty.  The jury found appellant guilty of both counts of aggravated murder and the accompanying specifications.  The jury also found appellant guilty of aggravated burglary and not guilty of rape but guilty of attempted rape.  The jury recommended a penalty of death; the trial court followed the recommendation and imposed a death sentence.  The court further sentenced appellant on counts three and four to consecutive terms of imprisonment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence of death. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which affirmed defendant's convictions for two counts of aggravated murder, one count of aggravated burglary, and one count of attempted rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, defendant contended that aggravated burglary and aggravated murder were allied offenses of similar import pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25, and thus, that the aggravated burglary could not be the basis for elevating the aggravated murder to the narrow class of murders subject to the death penalty. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and held that the capital sentencing scheme did not violate the Ohio or U.S. Constitutions because the sentencing scheme constitutionally narrowed the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. The death penalty was imposed for felony murder only when defendant was the principal offender or when the murder was premeditated. The aggravated murder and aggravated burglary were not merely incidental to each other, thus the aggravated burglary could be the basis for elevating the aggravated murder to felony murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Butler County, No. CA84-06-071. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At approximately 7:40 p.m. on December 12, 1983, officers of the Hamilton Police Department arrived at the scene of a shooting at American Legion Post 520 (hereinafter &quot;the Legion&quot;) in Hamilton, Ohio.  Lying on the pavement approximately six feet outside the front door of the Legion was the deceased victim, Suzette Butler.  An autopsy performed the following day by the county coroner revealed that Butler had died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds to the left side of her head.  One of the entrance wounds suggested that the muzzle of the murder weapon was within four to twenty inches of the victim's head at the time the weapon was fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of the shooting, Butler met her friend, Mona Aldridge, at the Legion sometime between 5:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Appellant, Von Clark &quot;Red&quot; Davis, arrived shortly thereafter, and eventually sat at a table with Butler and Aldridge.  Apparently, appellant and Butler had cohabited for several months, but had recently separated.  After a brief period of time, appellant and Butler arose from the table and walked out the front door.  Prior to leaving, Butler told Aldridge&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that she would be &quot;right back&quot; and asked Aldridge to watch her jacket, cigarettes and drink.  Several minutes later, a concerned Aldridge went to the front door of the Legion to look for Butler.  Aldridge opened the door slightly and discovered appellant pointing a gun at Butler's head.  Aldridge panicked and went back inside the bar.  Momentarily, others followed her into the bar saying that someone had been shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting was witnessed by Reginald Denmark and Cozette Massey.  the couple had been on a walk observing Christmas lights.  As they were walking, they saw a man and a woman talking in front of the Legion.  The man and woman did not appear to be arguing.  Two shots rang out.  As the woman (later identified as Butler) fell, another shot was fired.  Finally, &quot;* * * after she was down, he bent down and shot her in the head * * *.&quot; Both Massey and Denmark ultimately identified appellant as the person who shot Butler. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was later established that on the day of Butler's murder, appellant had sought out Mark &quot;Poppa&quot; Lovette to &quot;do him a favor&quot; in exchange for sixty dollars.  Along with a third party, Wade Coleman, a.k.a. Hank Stokes, appellant drove Lovette to a pawn shop&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and gave him money to purchase a handgun.  Lovette purchased a Raven P.25 semi-automatic handgun and gave it to appellant.  Appellant again gave money to Lovette and had him purchase shells for the gun at a K Mart store.  Lovette was then dropped off.  Appellant subsequently discovered that the K Mart shells did not fit the weapon.  Lovette was picked up again, the shells were returned to K Mart, and appellant drove Lovette to a local gun shop.  Lovette purchased a box of PMC .25 automatic shells and gave them to appellant.  Appellant then loaded the gun in the presence of Lovette and Coleman and placed the gun under the driver's seat of his car. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late that afternoon, Lovette and Coleman were dropped off separately. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Four &quot;spent&quot; PMC manufactured shells were found at the murder scene.  The murder weapon was never recovered.  However, a criminalist testified at trial that the bullets removed from Butler's head had been fired from a handgun manufactured by Raven or Astra arms companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the murder, appellant was arrested and an indictment was filed against him on January 6, 1984.  Count one of the indictment charged appellant with the aggravated murder of Butler &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in violation of R.C. 2903.01 (A), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the specification of having a firearm while committing the offense.  See R.C. 2929.71.  Count one also contained a specification of the aggravating circumstance that prior to this offense appellant had been convicted of an offense an essential element of which was the purposeful killing of, or attempt to kill, another.  See R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In count two, it was alleged that appellant did knowingly acquire, have, carry or use a firearm having previously been convicted of felonies of violence, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting with intent to wound on April 10, 1970, and murder in the second degree on April 20, 1971, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Butler County (Ohio), which affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated murder under Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2923.13(A)(2). The lower court also affirmed defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to sever the two charges contained in the indictment and that the trial court erred in imposing his death sentence. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the evidence of clearly revealed that the crimes charged in the indictment arose from the same act or transaction. Thus, the trial court's refusal to sever the charges was proper. Moreover, the evidence of guilt is so overwhelming that it may be concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that any introduction of defendant's prior convictions did not contribute to the finding of guilt. However, the court reversed defendant's death sentence after concluding that the trial court improperly weighed non-statutory aggravating circumstances outside of those listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A) against the mitigating factors in sentencing. The aggravating circumstances that could have been considered in imposing the death penalty were limited to those specifically enumerated in &sect; 2929.04(A). Thus, defendant was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the evening of November 23, 1984, Tony Jones returned from work to find his home in flames.  In the course of battling the blaze, firefighters discovered three bodies inside the house.  They were subsequently identified as those of Tony Jones' wife, Theresa, age twenty-seven, their daughter, Aubrey, seven, and Theresa's sister, Elizabeth Burton, twelve.  Autopsies revealed that Theresa had died from at least fourteen stab wounds, that Aubrey had perished as the result of twenty-one stab wounds, and that Elizabeth had died from a combination of five stab wounds, burns and carbon monoxide poisoning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 3, 1985, Detective Sergeant Rick Sizemore questioned Deborah Sowers about the homicides.  During the course of the interview, Sowers implicated defendant-appellant, Rhett DePew.  Based on this information, Sizemore and Detective Joe Rooks located appellant and arrested him on an outstanding, unrelated warrant.  Appellant was taken to the prosecuting attorney's office in Hamilton, where he was questioned for several hours about the murders.  Appellant eventually confessed to the crimes, giving the following&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  account. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of the murders, appellant and his girlfriend, Deborah Sowers, drove to the Joneses' residence to &quot;get some money.&quot; Appellant was armed with a large knife.  Once he believed the house to be empty, he approached it alone, entered through a back door, and began searching the house.  As he approached a bedroom, he was confronted by the victims, who began screaming.  He &quot;freaked out&quot; and &quot;just started swinging&quot; with his knife, stabbing the three repeatedly.  He then set fire to some clothing in Theresa's closet.  Before leaving, he discovered a baby crying in a back bedroom.  He wrapped the child in a blanket and left her on the porch of the house next door.  Sowers then picked appellant up and they went home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted on three counts of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B).  Each murder count contained the following death penalty specifications: the offense was committed while the offender was committing aggravated burglary ( R.C.  2929.04[A][7]), the offense was committed while the offender was committing aggravated arson ( R.C. 2929.04[A][7]), and the offense was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  more persons ( R.C. 2929.04[A][5]).  Appellant pleaded not guilty to all counts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before trial, appellant moved to suppress his confession.  He also filed a motion </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">in limine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to prevent Sowers from testifying against him on the basis that she was his common-law wife.  These motions, after a hearing, were denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury trial commenced on June 17, 1985.  Appellant offered no evidence.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts and on the accompanying specifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the penalty phase, appellant presented twenty witnesses and his own unsworn statement.  The jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and recommended a sentence of death.  The trial court, upon making its own required independent determination, adopted the recommendation and imposed a penalty of death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed. </SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted and convicted of aggravated murder of the victims during a burglary.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*306]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On July 11, 1984, at approximately 10:00 a.m., fifteen-year-old Tonnie Storey left her home in Cincinnati, Ohio, to attend summer school.  Tonnie was wearing a beige blouse, brown shorts, a watch, a ring, blue shoes with tassels, and a Michael Jackson button when she left.  Tonnie did not return home.  She was last seen with Alton Coleman and a woman matching Debra Brown's description. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 19, 1984, a realtor was preparing to show an abandoned building at 2826/2828 May Street in Cincinnati.  Inside, he found a body &quot;vibrating&quot; with maggots.  Scrawled above the body on the wall were the words &quot;I hate niggers death.&quot; The realtor notified the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body was identified as that of Tonnie Storey.  Her brown shorts were found near a shoeprint.  The shoeprint matched a print found at a different murder scene, and was later found to match shoes worn by Coleman.  Also found were the tassels from Tonnie's shoes, a Michael Jackson button with Brown's fingerprint on it, and pieces of an envelope with writing on it.  Near Tonnie's body was a bracelet belonging to Raymond Temple.  Tonnie's beige blouse, watch, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ring, and shoes were never found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debra Brown (hereinafter &quot;appellant&quot;) and Coleman were jointly indicted for the murder of Tonnie Storey on October 10, 1984.  Appellant was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder.  Count One charged her with killing Tonnie purposely and with prior calculation and design.  Count Two charged that the killing took place while appellant was committing, attempting, or fleeing after committing or attempting aggravated robbery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both counts contained specifications alleging (1) the killing was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing or attempt to kill two or more persons; and (2) the murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for aggravated robbery.  Specification Four to Count Two alleged a felony-murder and that appellant was either the principal offender or acted with prior calculation and design.  Count Three charged her with aggravated robbery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the state introduced evidence that appellant murdered or participated in the murders of Tonnie Storey, Tamika Turks, Donna Williams, Virginia Temple, Rachelle Temple, and Marlene Walters.  The state also contended that appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  participated in assaults on or attempts to kill Annie Hillard, Palmer Jones, Frank Duvendack, Ralph Welch and Harry Walters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was convicted of all charges and specifications on June 7, 1985.  On June 10, 1985, the mitigation hearing was held.  That same day, the jury recommended the death penalty.  The trial court passed sentence of death on July 11, 1985.  The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the indictment against her was defective because the grand jury was composed of only 9 people, instead of 15. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying her motions for joint trial with her co-defendant, for a mistrial, or for a change of venue. Additionally, the trial court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to sequester potential jurors during voir dire. The court determined that defendant's right to counsel was not violated where she initiated a new colloquy with the police. Furthermore, her right to a fair trial was not violated by the refusal to suppress identification testimony and physical evidence or to exclude evidence that she engaged in a course of conduct involving the purpose to kill two or more persons. The court decided that admission of defendant's videotaped testimony given at an earlier trial did not violate her self-incrimination privilege. Defendant's challenges to the prosecutor's closing argument, to the jury instructions, and to the death penalty lacked merit. The court overruled any remaining assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case is one of a number in which we have allowed a motion to certify in order for this court to review various provisions of the Public Employees' Collective Bargaining Act found within R.C. Chapter 4117.  In this case, the Ohio Association of Public School Employees (&quot;OAPSE&quot;) filed a petition for representative election with the State Employment Relations Board (&quot;SERB&quot;).  The appellee here, South Community, Inc., as the employer, moved to dismiss, asserting that South Community's employees were not &quot;public employees&quot; within the meaning of R.C. 4117.01(C).  SERB denied the motion to dismiss and directed that the election proceed.  OAPSE distributed a sample &quot;Official Secret Ballot&quot; which suggested that SERB had endorsed OAPSE.  The election was held on October 30, 1985, in which election OAPSE prevailed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Community objected to the election, and SERB set aside the results and ordered another election; however, SERB held that only employees hired before July 3, 1985 were eligible to vote in the rerun election.  On December 18 a rerun election was held, and over the objection of South Community, SERB certified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OAPSE as the exclusive bargaining unit of the employees.  South Community then appealed to the court of common pleas basing its appeal upon R.C. 119.12, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whose appellate procedure, it is argued by appellee herein, is made applicable to R.C.

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAPSE filed a motion to intervene in the appeal in the court of common pleas.  Both OAPSE and SERB filed motions to dismiss on the basis that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  The trial court granted SERB's motion to dismiss on the basis that SERB's determination of the exclusive bargaining agent was final under R.C.  4117.06(A) which, in pertinent part, states: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state employment relations board shall decide in each case the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining.  The determination&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is final and conclusive and not appealable to the court.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed the trial court on the basis that the appeal from SERB was not the certification of the representative unit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">per se,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but that the appeal was one concerning the issue of whether it was proper for SERB to exclude a number of employees from voting in the rerun election.  The court of appeals thus found that appeals concerning the manner in which the election was held fall within the general appellate language of R.C.  4117.02(M), and are therefore appealable pursuant to R.C. 119.12. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The main issue on appeal was whether a decision concerning how an election was held was appealable.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early evening on August 6, 1984, eighty-four-year-old Clara Wilson, the decedent, and Allen Earl Holloway, defendant-appellant, were visiting Betty Jeanette Sanders at her apartment.  Wilson had not previously met Holloway.  Wilson eventually left and apparently went back to her apartment, which was located in the same building.  Approximately one hour later, Holloway left the Sanders apartment and went to the Wilson apartment.  Lelia Smith, who lived across the hall from Wilson, saw Wilson admit Holloway into her apartment at approximately 7:30 p.m. Later that evening around 9:00 p.m., Rashee Broach, a twelve-year-old boy who also lived in the same apartment building, saw Holloway outside Wilson's apartment carrying a radio later identified as belonging to the decedent.  The next morning, Sanders and Smith noticed that Wilson was not involved in her customary routine, and went to her apartment to check on her.  As they knocked on the door, it opened, revealing that the apartment was in a state of disarray.  The two women called the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon investigation, the police found broken false teeth on the floor, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  cushions off the couch and a rocking chair overturned.  There was blood in the bedroom.  The bathroom was covered with blood and inside the tub was Wilson's body.  Her head was positioned below the faucet of the tub; the skin appeared to be partially peeled off her face and hands by scalding water from the faucet.  An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a combination of strangulation and beating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police subsequently questioned Holloway as a suspect.  After receiving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings, Holloway gave the police a number of different stories concerning his activities in the apartment building during the time of Wilson's murder.  After being presented with incriminating evidence, he admitted killing Wilson.  Holloway recounted that he asked her for money, and upon being refused, how he then beat Wilson.  Holloway related that he searched the apartment for something to sell and found a radio.  Although the coroner presented evidence of manual strangulation, Holloway claimed he tied a sheet around Wilson's neck to stop her bleeding.  Seeing that Wilson's neck to stop her bleeding.  Seeing that Wilson was turning blue, defendant claimed he placed her in the bathtub and turned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on the water in an attempt to revive her.  When he realized that Wilson was dead, he became scared and left. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigation of the Wilson apartment yielded a number of items bearing Holloway's fingerprints.  A search of the defendant's residence produced the radio taken from Wilson's apartment, and the defendant's left shoe bearing blood stains and a hair sample matching Wilson's blood type and hair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 30, 1984, the Hamilton County Grand Jury indicted Holloway on two counts of aggravated murder.  The first count alleged that Holloway purposely caused the death of Wilson while committing an aggravated robbery.  The second count alleged that Holloway purposely caused the death of Wilson while committing an aggravated burglary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, after the state presented its case, Holloway moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim. R.  29.  The court overruled the motion.  Holloway produced no evidence during the guilt phase of the trial and offered no closing argument.  The jury found Holloway guilty on both counts of aggravated murder and on the specification as to each count. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the penalty phase of the proceedings, Holloway presented considerable evidence in mitigation. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His sister and brother testified that he was continually ridiculed as a child because of his physical deformities (half-formed nose, cleft palate, and harelip) and was often beaten by their father.  Two clinical psychologists diagnosed Holloway as being at least mildly retarded and as suffering from an antisocial personality disorder with possible neurological impairment.  However, the psychological testimony conflicted as to whether Holloway could function reasonably in society.  Further evidence showed that during Holloway's previous stay at a penal institution, the state failed to provide him with psychological treatment requested by the judge who sentenced him.  Despite repeated protestations from the Hamilton County Prosecutor's office, the Parole Board released Holloway less than two months prior to the present offense.  Further evidence was presented to show that the Parole Board knew that Holloway had a dangerous personality when it released him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon submission of the evidence and arguments of counsel, the jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and recommended the sentence of death on each count.  The trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court reached the same conclusion, and sentenced Holloway to death on both counts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon review, the court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The court found that Holloway's conviction for aggravated murder while committing an aggravated burglary was not supported by the evidence and, therefore, the trial court erred in overruling Holloway's motion for judgment of acquittal as to count two.  The court of appeals affirmed the judgment and sentence of the trial court in all other respects. </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05(A), that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the death sentences were neither disproportionate nor inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Stark County, Nos. CA-7016 and CA-7017. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two cases arise from the same stipulated facts.  On July 29, 1985, two officers from the Stark County Sheriff's Department and two officers from the Canton Police Department went to a game room at the Hillbilly Haven in Stark County and began playing pinball.  While they were there, appellant, Anthony J. Volpe, told Lt. Tom Thomas, one of the officers, that he (Volpe) &quot;had some good machines in [the] back room.&quot; The officers entered the back room where they found two Castle machines.  Volpe gave instructions on how to play the machines and said &quot;they&quot; paid money for the number of credits earned.  Three of the officers played the machines for over one half of an hour and obtained a number of credits for which they received money from an employee.  One of the officers then applied stickum paper to the machines to mark them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the officers then arranged for a search warrant.  On July 30, 1985, three officers (two deputies and one police officer) returned to the game room where they again played the Castle machines.  One of the officers received a payoff from appellant, Chester R. Chisholm, for &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the credits he accumulated.  One of the officers was wired with a body mike and notified nearby officers that the job was completed and that the search warrant could be served.  Other officers then arrived to serve the search warrant.  The officers seized the two Castle machines and arrested appellants.  Volpe was indicted on three counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 2915.02, one count of operating a gambling house in violation of R.C. 2915.03, and two counts of possession of criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24.  Chisholm was indicted on two counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 2915.02, one count of operating a gambling house in violation of R.C.  2915.03, and two counts of possession of criminal tools in violation of R.C.  2923.24. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants each filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to suppress evidence illegally obtained by the state which, after an evidentiary hearing, were overruled by the trial court.  Appellants then entered no contest pleas to the respective indictments.  Because appellants were apparently first-time gambling offenders, the court found them each guilty of misdemeanor counts of gambling and operating a gambling house and a felony count for &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  possession of criminal tools.  Judgment was entered accordingly.  The court suspended appellants' sentences and placed each appellant on probation.  Appellants appealed, challenging the constitutionality of R.C. 2923.24, as applied to them, and on its face.  The court of appeals affirmed the convictions, essentially finding R.C. 2923.24 constitutional on its face.  However, finding its judgment to be in conflict with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Jefferson County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">McDonald</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (July 3, 1986), App. Nos.  85-J-12, 85-J-13, 85-J-14, 85-J-16 and 85-J-17, unreported, the Court of Appeals for Stark County certified the record of each case to this court for review and final determination of the consolidated cases.  </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2915.02 and 2915.03) and a felony count for possession of criminal tools (Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24). After determining that &sect; 2923.24 was constitutional on its face and as applied, the Court of Appeals of Stark County (Ohio) certified defendants' cases to the court in order to resolve a conflict among the appellate courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants appealed their convictions, challenging the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24. The appeals court found the statute constitutional, but certified the record of the cases to the court to settle a conflict between its decision and the decision of another appeals court finding the statute unconstitutional. Upon review, the court reversed the decision and remanded the case to the trial court. The court found that the clear intent of the legislature in enacting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2915.02 was to punish the possession of a gambling device as a misdemeanor and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24, a general statute prohibiting possession of criminal tools and classifying such activity as a felony, could not be applied to possession of a gambling device.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 25, 1985, appellant, M.D. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (a female, then age twelve), was charged with one count of complicity to rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02 and 2923.03(A)(4).  The complaint alleged that on July 8, 1985, M.D. unlawfully caused an innocent and irresponsible person, David (then age five), to commit the rape of one Cassie (then age five).  A denial was entered on October 4, 1985, and defense counsel later moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that the prosecution of a twelve year old for a felony sex crime involving an incident of &quot;playing doctor&quot; was unconstitutional and contrary to R.C.  Chapter 2151.  This motion was overruled. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;This court granted appellant's motion to proceed under pseudonym on May 13, 1987, and the record in this appeal was ordered sealed.  Further, in order to avoid further stigmatizing the other innocent children involved in this case, we have attempted to conceal their identities as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trial to the court began on April 14, 1986.  Both of the children involved in the alleged rape were deemed competent to testify, as was M.D.'s nine-year-old sister.  The three children testified &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that they, with M.D., were &quot;playing doctor,&quot; and that at the direction of M.D., David dropped his pants and placed his penis in Cassie's mouth, ostensibly because M.D. had instructed them to take temperature that way.  M.D., who had originally denied being present when these events took place, testified at trial that she was present and observed the conduct between David and Cassie.  The trial court found each element of the offense charged had been established beyond a reasonable doubt and adjudicated M.D. a delinquent child, pursuant to Juv. R.  29(F).  She was placed on probation under the supervision of her parents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed, holding that appellant had raised for the first time on appeal the issue of the constitutionality of applying the rape statute to children under the age of thirteen, and had thus waived such challenge.  A motion for reconsideration was denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

A motion for reconsideration was denied. The matter was before the court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The minor, a 12 year-old girl, allegedly caused an innocent and irresponsible person, a five year-old boy, to rape a five year-old girl. The minor was charged with one count of complicity to rape and was adjudicated a delinquent child. On appeal, the court held that the initiation of proceedings against the minor constituted a denial of due process. Therefore, the adjudication of delinquency was vacated. While the minor's constitutional challenge to the proceedings was presented to the trial court in only the most general of terms, the court found that it was sufficient to avoid waiver of that issue on appeal. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.03(C), a person could not be convicted as an accomplice until the offense had actually been committed. The court also noted that the type of sexual conduct, as that term was defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.01(A), that was at issue was fellatio. Because fellatio required either stimulation or sexual satisfaction, the court concluded that no crime had occurred. The court noted that the proceedings were inconsistent with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2151 and the Ohio Rules of Juvenile Procedure and their treatment of minors under the age of 13.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case before us presents questions regarding the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance as applied to appellants' properties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Properties</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants William and Margarete Karches (hereinafter &quot;Karches&quot;) own approximately fifteen acres located in the eastern section of the city of Cincinnati, in an area known as the &quot;California area.&quot; The property borders the Ohio River, has approximately seven hundred twenty feet of river frontage and is in the floodplain.  The Coney Island Amusement Park (hereinafter &quot;Old Coney&quot;) abuts the property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants Richard L. and Freda Flerlage (hereinafter &quot;Flerlage&quot;) own approximately twenty-seven acres located in the California area.  The property borders the Ohio River, is in the floodplain and has approximately twelve hundred feet of river frontage.  Both the Flerlage and Karches properties have flooded in the past.  The map found in the Appendix shows the two properties and the surrounding area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1957, Karches leased their property from the then owner.  The property was zoned Business &quot;B&quot; and allowed commercial use.  The lease term was for the life of the owner and contained &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an option allowing Karches to purchase the property upon the owner's death.  Karches made significant improvements while the property was commercially zoned.  Taft Broadcasting Company (hereinafter &quot;Taft&quot;), owner of Old Coney, purchased this property subject to the Karches option.  On September 7, 1965, Karches exercised the option to purchase. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flerlage purchased their property in 1958 at which time it was zoned for commercial use (Business &quot;B&quot;). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Zoning History</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1963, the city planning commission approved a city-wide zoning proposal which changed the classification of the Karches and Flerlage properties from Business &quot;B&quot; (industrial) to RF-1 Riverfront.  Neither Karches nor Flerlage received written notice of the change, of which they did not learn until 1966 and 1968, respectively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notification of the city-wide zoning proposal and its subsequent adoption was given via several newspaper articles published in 1962 and 1963.  These articles were accompanied by maps of the affected areas.  Together, the publications indicated that the whole of the California area, including Old Coney, would be reclassified to the more restrictive RF-1 category.  Old Coney, however, was designated as &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RF-2, which was less restrictive and permitted commercial use.  Old Coney retained its RF-2 designation from 1963 until September 25, 1979, when Taft voluntarily relinquished that zoning, apparently in exchange for a change by the city in zoning use definitions which allowed Old Coney its amusement park use in the RF-1 classification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon learning (in 1966) of the 1963 zoning change, Karches contacted an attorney and discovered that the statute of limitations had run on an appeal from the rezoning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1969, Karches explored the possibility of having the property rezoned from RF-1 to RF-2 because the Fenton Rigging Company wanted to lease it for use as a river terminal.  The negotiations for the lease were terminated, however, and no further action was taken on the rezoning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1977, Karches petitioned city council for a change in zoning to RF-2 to allow operation of an aggregate storage terminal.  Public hearings were held.  The city denied the change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After unsuccessfully attempting to use their land for a basin marina in the early 1970s, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Flerlage discussed zoning changes with the city numerous times over the next several years in an attempt to make use of their land.  Flerlage &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also relied upon the 1977 Karches petition for a zoning change. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Richard Flerlage testified at trial that his plans for the marina were thwarted when the state took part of his land through eminent domain to build the I-275 bridge. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1970s, the city conducted a study of the riverfront area, including the California area, which culminated in the California Land Development Use Plan in 1978.  In 1981, the Riverfront Advisory Council (hereinafter &quot;RAC&quot;) conducted yet another study.  This one, as it applied to the California area, was modeled after the 1978 plan.  The RAC Study was undertaken to encourage land uses which would promote economic development by increasing industrial use of land and enhance the livability of the city by increasing recreational use. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 12, 1980, appellants filed suit against the city in the court of common pleas alleging that the RF-1 zoning ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to their property and was a taking of their property requiring just compensation.  Appellants also continued their conversations with city personnel concerning rezoning until Flerlage were told by the city manager in 1983 that the city would take no action until the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> litigation was resolved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants dismissed the 1980 lawsuit without prejudice when the city assured them that their problems would be settled by revisions to the RF-1 ordinance in 1983 based upon the recommendations of the RAC Study. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Present Case</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants were not helped by the 1983 revisions and filed a second suit against the city </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is the subject of the instant appeal. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;The Attorney General of the state of Ohio was joined as a defendant pursuant to R.C. 2721.12, but elected not to participate. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants alleged in Count I of their complaint that the RF-1 zoning precluded them from developing their properties in an economical manner; that the highest and best use of the properties was commercial/industrial; that the previous zoning allowed commercial/industrial use; and that as a result of the restrictive zoning, the properties had no market value other than one for speculative purposes.  They further alleged that the RF-1 zoning, as applied to their specific properties, had no reasonable relation to the public health, safety and welfare; was arbitrary, discriminatory and unreasonable; and, therefore, deprived them of their properties without due process of law in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contravention of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2721 and permanent injunctive and other relief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Count II, appellants alleged a cause of action under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S. Code, in that the zoning, as applied to their properties, so devalued them as to constitute a taking without due process or just compensation, for which appellants requested damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a bench trial, the court found that the existing RF-1 zoning, as applied to appellants' properties, was unreasonable, arbitrary and confiscatory; had no substantial relationship to the public health, safety or general welfare; substantially interfered with appellants' right to use their properties in an economically feasible manner; and, therefore, was unconstitutional.  The court ordered the city to rezone the properties within sixty days.  The court order further provided that the properties would be rezoned to the next less restrictive use by operation of Cincinnati Municipal Code Section 102.3, in the event that the city failed to rezone the properties. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court did not award damages to appellants for an unconstitutional taking.  The city took an appeal from the trial court's order but neither Karches nor Flerlage took an appeal from the denial of their claims for damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed the order of the trial court on the ground that the issue of constitutionality was not ripe for judicial determination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The landowners contended that the city's zoning for their property in the flood plain of the Ohio River was unconstitutional as applied to their property because they could not develop any productive use for the property. The court found that the landowners had unsuccessfully attempted to change the zoning. The court reversed the judgment and concurred with the trial court that the zoning was unconstitutional as applied. The appellate court had held that the landowners' action was not ripe because there was no final decision on a change in zoning. To the contrary, the court concluded that it was ripe for the landowners to seek declaratory relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2721 because a final decision had been made concerning the application of the zoning regulation to the property and the landowners had effectively exhausted their remedies with the city. Finding that there were no economically feasible uses for the land under the current zoning and that the zoning did not advance any legitimate government interests, the court determined that the zoning was unconstitutional as applied to the property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael F. Beuke appeals from his convictions on various charges, including aggravated murder, for which he received the sentence of death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of May 14, 1983, Gregory M. Wahoff picked up a hitchhiker, later identified as the defendant-appellant, Michael Beuke.  Beuke produced a .38 caliber revolver and ordered Wahoff to drive east on I-275, explaining that he just wanted to take Wahoff's car and would bring it back.  After exiting the freeway briefly to refuel the car at a Sohio gas station whose attendant later identified Beuke at trial, Wahoff re-entered the freeway and was directed to drive to Trustee Lane or Road, a small dirt road in Hamilton County, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of this road, Beuke told Wahoff to stop the car and get out.  After both men exited the car, Wahoff offered the defendant his wallet by throwing it at him.  Leaving the wallet where it fell, Beuke ordered Wahoff to walk to a wooded area.  When Wahoff refused, Beuke asked him, &quot;Do you want to die here?&quot; At that point, Wahoff tried to get the gun from the defendant by running towards him.  He missed his chance and kept on running,  but &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not get far.  Beuke shot Wahoff in the back, the bullet lodging against his spine, and Wahoff fell to the ground, paralyzed.  When he caught up with Wahoff, Beuke placed the gun against Wahoff's face and fired a second shot.  Fully conscious, Wahoff played dead.  Apparently convinced that he had killed Wahoff, Beuke got into Wahoff's car and drove away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant was seen driving out of Trustee Lane by a nearby resident who later identified him at trial.  Beuke drove Wahoff's car, a red or maroon GTO, back to an area near where he had been hitchhiking on Colerain Avenue.  The car broke down and Beuke had to push it some distance into a Ponderosa Steak House parking lot.  As he pushed the car, he was seen by another witness who was also able to identify him at trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the sheriff's department had been called to the scene of the shooting.  On a hillside near Trustee Lane, a sheriff's deputy found Wahoff conscious but unable to walk.  The bullet was surgically removed from his back and given to the police.  A second bullet was recovered from the hillside two days later.  Wahoff's car was found on May 16, 1983 in the Ponderosa Steak House parking lot where defendant had &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> left it.  Latent fingerprints belonging to Beuke were recovered from the car.  The police also learned that a large green plastic cup was missing from Wahoff's car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 23, 1983, Kim E. Wilson, a high school student who lived on Romohr Road in rural Clermont County, Ohio, watched as her mother helped Beuke free a 1974 green Thunderbird which was stuck off the side of the road.  Beuke had borrowed the car from a friend and co-employee, Michael J. Cahill.  Kim apparently directed Beuke to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Voss where Beuke measured rooms for carpeting ordered from Beuke's employer, Harry's Corner.  Both Kim and Peter Voss were able to later identify appellant at trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 1, 1983, Kim was walking down Romohr Road when she saw a red hat on the side of the road.  As she drew near, she saw a body in the bushes down in the ditch.  Testimony by a road department employee established the grass there had been cut at approximately 11:00 a.m. The body was lying on top of the clippings.  Union Township police and an investigator with the Clermont County Prosecutor's office responded.  The body was identified as being that of Robert S. Craig, a resident of Hamilton County. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two hundred and sixty dollars was found in Craig's shirt pocket and another five dollars in his wallet.  He had been shot twice in the head and once in the chest.  One gunshot wound was located between the victim's eyes.  Craig's car was later recovered in a parking lot in the Tri-County Mall in Hamilton County.  Upon opening the car's trunk, the police found fresh fish in storage containers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Craig's killing, Beuke revealed to Cahill that he was the &quot;mad hitchhiker&quot; sought by the police in connection with shootings in the area.  He told Cahill that he had been picked up by Craig on I-275 and that, before he actually killed Craig, Craig had forgiven him.  Beuke also mentioned that, since that day, he always smelled fish even though no fish were around.  The defendant also admitted to Cahill that he had shot another person. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig was employed by Inland Reef, a fresh fish supplier located in Hamilton County.  He had a history of picking up hitchhikers and engaging them in conversation about religion.  On June 1, 1983, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Craig left Inland Reef to make a delivery of fish to a restaurant in Hamilton County which he had reached, on other occasions,  via &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I-275 and I-71.  The June 1 delivery, however, was never completed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 3, 1983, Bruce B. Graham saw a male hitchhiker carrying a red gas can while Graham was driving down I-74 to Cincinnati.  Graham assumed that the man had run out of gas somewhere on the expressway.  He picked up the man in order to take him to an exit and obtain gas for his car.  Graham identified Beuke later at trial as the man he had picked up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Graham drove, the defendant pulled a short-barreled revolver out of his jacket and instructed Graham to drive a certain route, telling him that he &quot;needed&quot; his car and that he was just going to tie him up loosely so that Graham could later escape.  He ordered Graham to exit the freeway in Indiana and drive to a secluded rural area.  When Graham stopped the car, Beuke immediately fired the gun at him.  The bullet grazed Graham's head, inflicting a minor but bloody wound.  A struggle for the gun ensued.  Graham eventually jumped out of the car and ran, but, as he fled, Beuke fired several shots, one striking Graham in the shoulder.  Graham made his way to a farmhouse and Beuke drove off in Graham's car.  Graham, who had approximately $ 160 in cash, was never asked &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his wallet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graham was taken to a hospital where the bullet was removed from his shoulder and given to Indiana police.  A description of Graham's car was disseminated and a few hours later the car was discovered at I-74 and North Bend Road, not far from the Hamilton County site where Graham first picked up the defendant.  There was a bullet hole in the windshield and blood splattered in the car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, Cahill informed the authorities about the criminal activities Beuke had described to him.  A broadcast seeking defendant's apprehension followed.  The green Thunderbird was found a few blocks from Beuke's home and, pursuant to a warrant, the car was searched on June 29, 1983.  The green cup which had been taken from Wahoff's automobile, the gas can used in the Graham assault, and a blood-stained blue and white football jersey were found in the trunk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 11:52 a.m. on June 29, a Hamilton County sheriff's detective recognized Beuke from a composite which had been circulated.  Beuke first responded to questioning by giving a false name.  Thereafter, Beuke admitted his identity and told the detective, &quot;You have got me.&quot; At the time of his arrest, Beuke had a .38 caliber revolver &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wrapped inside a windbreaker that he was carrying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beuke was indicted on: one count of aggravated murder, with two specifications, (1) for causing the death of Robert Craig as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful attempt to kill two or more persons, and (2) for causing the death of Craig in the course of an aggravated robbery; two counts of attempted aggravated murder of Wahoff and Graham; three counts of aggravated robbery for the theft of automobiles belonging to Wahoff, Craig, and Graham; three counts of kidnapping for the abduction of Wahoff, Craig, and Graham; and one count of carrying a concealed weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beuke's jury trial began September 19, 1983.  Evidence presented by the prosecution included Wahoff's and Graham's testimony, fingerprints belonging to Beuke found on the Wahoff and Craig automobiles, bullets removed from Craig and Wahoff identified as having been fired from Beuke's gun, and defendant's admissions to Cahill.  The prosecution demonstrated Beuke's familiarity with the areas where Craig, Wahoff, and Graham were taken and shot, as well as the locations where their cars were found.  The trial concluded on October 5, 1983 after the prosecution presented &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a total of thirty-nine witnesses and without Beuke's having testified or offered any other direct evidence in his defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all ten counts of the indictment as well as the two specifications making Beuke eligible for the death penalty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mitigation hearing was continued to October 7, 1983, although defense counsel sought more time to prepare therefor.  In mitigation, the defense offered into evidence a presentence report and presented only defendant's parents as witnesses at the hearing.  The parents' testimony focused upon the family's religious orientation, the defendant's active involvement in related activities and the Boy Scouts through age eighteen, and the family's personal and economic hardship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and recommended that Beuke be sentenced to death.  The trial court adopted the jury's recommendation and imposed the sentence of death in addition to the imposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment for the other crimes.  The court of appeals affirmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, Nos. 85AP-1033 and 85AP-945. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 86-1532, Columbus police officers applied for a warrant to search the residence of defendant-appellant, Denis Young.  The facts contained in the affidavit for the warrant were provided to police by two male minors who had been arrested on separate occasions for being a runaway and for male prostitution, respectively.  Both informants reported that they had been picked up by Young and taken to Young's home, that Young had taken nude photographs of them, and that they had engaged in sexual acts with Young.  Further, both informants reported that they had observed photographs in Young's house of nude minors or of minors engaged in sexual activity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warrant was executed on March 21, 1985.  Various items were seized, including four photographs of one of the informants.  Young was subsequently charged with possession of material depicting a minor in a state of nudity in violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(3). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that R.C. 2907.323(A)(3) is unconstitutional.  He also moved to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the search, alleging&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the search warrant was issued without probable cause.  Both motions were overruled, the motion to suppress after a hearing.  Young thereafter entered a plea of no contest and was found guilty of the charge set forth in the indictment.  Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed Young's conviction, upholding the constitutionality of R.C. 2907.323(A)(3). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case No. 86-1728, Columbus police secured a warrant to search the residence of defendant-appellant, Clyde J. Osborne.  The warrant was issued pursuant to an affidavit sworn by Detective James A. Phillips of the Columbus Police Department.  The information recited in the affidavit was based on a conversation between Phillips and an Ohio postal inspector.  The inspector informed Phillips that a Florida postal inspector had arrested two persons in that state who, during interrogation, implicated Osborne as having photographic negatives of child pornography in his possession. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warrant was executed on July 22, 1985, resulting in the seizure of, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> photographs of nude male minors.  Osborne was subsequently charged with a violation of R.C. 2907.323(A)(3). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osborne filed various pretrial motions, including a motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to dismiss the indictment on the basis that R.C. 2907.323(A)(3) is unconstitutional, and a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search.  These motions were overruled and, after a jury trial, appellant was found guilty as charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals upheld the constitutionality of R.C. 2907.323(A)(3) and affirmed Osborne's conviction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By separate entries, the appellate court, finding its judgments in case Nos. 86-1532 and 86-1728 to be in conflict with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In consolidated appeals, defendants challenged orders of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which affirmed their convictions under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.322(A)(5), of knowingly possessing or controlling material which showed a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality. The defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statute on various grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Both defendants were found in the possession of photographs of nude male minors, and were convicted of violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.323. The appellate court confirmed the judgments of conviction. On further review, the court affirmed the convictions and upheld the statute as constitutional. The court stated that the statute was not overbroad, because it applied only to a narrowly defined subset of photographs of nude minors, namely those in which such nudity constituted a lewd exhibition or involved a graphic focus on the genitals. The court also stated that the statute was not impermissibly vague by not defining the term &quot;minor,&quot; because that term was generally understood to signify a person under the age of 18. The court, further, stated that the statute did not lack a requirement of scienter; rather the statute required a standard of recklessness on the part of the defendant, which satisfied the constitutional requirement of scienter. Finally, the court held that the &quot;proper purposes&quot; exceptions set forth in &sect; 2907.323(A)(3)(a) - (b) were affirmative defenses within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05(C)(2).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, No. C-850340. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alton Coleman and Debra D. Brown bicycled into Norwood, Ohio, on July 13, 1984, at about 9:30 a.m. About three hours later, they drove away in Harry Walters' car, leaving Harry Walters unconscious and Marlene Walters dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Walters survived.  He testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camping trailer he had been offering for sale.  Upon agreement to sell the trailer, Harry Walters invited Coleman and Brown into his home.  He sat on the couch as he and Coleman discussed the trailer title.  Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Harry Walters on the back of the head.  The force of the blow broke the candlestick and drove an island of bone against Mr. Walters' brain.  Mr. Walters remembered little else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, came home from work at about 3:45 p.m. At the bottom of the basement steps, she found her father, barely alive, and her mother, dead.  Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet.  Her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her mother's head was covered with a bloody sheet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expert testimony indicated Marlene Walters had been struck on the head approximately twenty to twenty-five times.  Twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of vice grips, covered her face and scalp.  The back of her skull was smashed to pieces.  Parts of her skull and brain were missing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The living room hallway, and basement, were splattered with blood.  Fragments of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room.  Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a blood-stained magazine rack located in the living room.  Bloody footprints, made by two different kinds of shoes, were found in the basement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was gone.  Money, jewelry, and shoes had been stolen.  Left behind were two bicycles, clothes and shoes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coleman was found guilty of aggravated murder while committing aggravated burglary under R.C. 2903.01.  The jury found Coleman was the principal offender of this offense.  He was also found to be a participant in a course of conduct involving the purposeful attempt to kill two or more persons pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also found Coleman guilty of aggravated murder while committing aggravated robbery under R.C. 2903.01 and found he was the principal offender.  They also found, as in the first charge, that Coleman participated in a course of conduct involving the purposeful attempt to kill two or more people.  Finally, the jury found Coleman guilty of attempted aggravated murder, aggravated robbery (theft of a motor vehicle and other personal property, after inflicting serious physical harm upon Harry Walters), and aggravated burglary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury concluded that the death penalty was appropriate and the trial judge ultimately agreed.  The sentence of death was imposed for the aggravated murder convictions.  Terms of incarceration were imposed for the remaining convictions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence of death.  The court, however, found the trial court erred by not specifically indicating in jury instructions regarding complicity that the inference created in a felony-murder charge is nonconclusive.  The appellate court held this error to be harmless. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant hit the husband with a candlestick, driving a piece of bone into his brain. He also attacked the wife, who died. The husband survived and testified at trial. On appeal, defendant raised various claims of error including that the guilt-phase jury instructions on complicity were flawed because they did not comport with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2903.01(D). He also argued that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence and that imposition of the death penalty was not warranted. In affirming defendant's convictions, the court found that the jury instructions read as a whole were proper and that the appellate court erred in finding that the trial court's instructions regarding complicity were wrong, albeit harmless. The court also found that the evidence established that defendant intended to kill the victim and, although there were many aggravating factors, there were no mitigating circumstances; thus, imposition of the death penalty was proper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 6, 1985, three investigators from the Ohio Department of Liquor Control arrived at VFW Post 3562 in Richfield, Ohio, to investigate complaints the department had received concerning gambling on the premises.  One of the investigators attempted to gain entrance to the club.  The investigator was denied entrance when, in response to the bartender's question, he told the bartender that he was not a member. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three investigators then gained entrance by properly identifying themselves and indicating their desire to conduct an inspection of the club.  The investigators proceeded to conduct a general search of the entire business premises, which took approximately one hour and fifteen minutes.  In the process of their search, the investigators discovered two &quot;Dwarf's Den&quot; electronic video machines.  The investigators also found some accounting records in the kitchen area of the club which the investigators alleged indicated that the club received payoffs on the electronic video games.  The investigators then contacted the local police who assisted in confiscating the machines.  Appellant, VFW Post 3562 in Richfield, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and its bartender were charged with violations of R.C. 2915.02(A)(5). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53 were unconstitutional insofar as they failed to establish time, place, and scope limitations on warrantless administrative searches of liquor establishments by agents of the Department of Liquor Control. The warrantless administrative search by agents of the Department of Liquor Control was unreasonable. Further, the court determined that evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless administrative search could not have been used in a criminal prosecution under a statute of general criminality not related to provisions of Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present appeal involves the issuance of a permanent injunction on April 3, 1985 by the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County enjoining defendants (state of Ohio; Mahoning County, Ohio; city of Youngstown, Ohio; city of Struthers, Ohio; city of Campbell, Ohio; Austintown Township, Ohio; and Beaver Township, Ohio), their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1 From seizing, impounding, or confiscating, poker machines owned, leased or operated by Plaintff Lawrence Garono, dbd [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] Garono Vending Company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2 From making any public statement to the effect that the poker machine is a 'gambling device' or an 'illegal gambling device,' or which suggests or implies that Plaintiff Garono, by owning, leasing or operating such machines, is engaged in an unlawful activity.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants (state of Ohio and city of Youngstown), together with defendants (Mahoning County, city of Struthers, Beaver Township and Austintown Township), appealed to the court of appeals claiming that the injunction interfered with the ability of the police to carry out their duties to enforce the law and that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the prohibition against public statements violated appellants' First Amendment rights of free speech.  The court of appeals held that because the machines were not illegal or gambling devices under the reasoning of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Gavlek</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Dec. 27, 1983), Mahoning App. No. 83 C.A. 25, unreported, the police could be restrained from seizing the machines.  The city of Struthers was excepted from this injunction, however, since there was no evidence that any of its officers or officials was involved with the seizure of the machines.  The court of appeals refused to uphold the second part of the injunction regarding the prohibition of public statements, finding that this constituted a prior restraint and therefore violated appellants' rights of free speech. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The factual record consists solely of a Stipulation of Facts submitted to the common pleas court which reads in pertinent part as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1.  That Plaintiff Lawrence Garono, a sole proprietor, dba Garono Vending Company, is presently engaged in the business of leasing video poker machines in Mahoning County, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2.  That during the past year, State law enforcement agents, and law enforcement agents of the City of Youngstown&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Austintown Township, have seized approximately 60 video poker machines from business locations inside Mahoning County, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;3.  That none of said machines has been returned, and said machines are still in the custody of the law enforcement agencies enumerated in Stipulation No. 2 hereinabove. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;4.  That when interviewed by WKBN and WYTV on or about January 26, 1985, Detective Jack Palma of the Youngstown Police Department made statements to the effect that any person who seeks to obtain the return of a poker machine 'will be read his constitutional rights,' and that if any poker machines are found by the police in Youngstown, they will be seized 'under the gaming laws.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;5.  That during the past year, law enforcement agents of the City of Youngstown have disseminated statements via the news media, characterizing poker machines as 'gambling devices,' 'illegal gambling devices,' and 'illegal' bet devices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;6.  That no poker machine has ever been introduced into evidence in the trial of any case in Mahoning County, Ohio, involving alleged gambling in connection with a poker machine.  In lieu thereof, photographic evidence and/or expert testimony from a police officer concerning&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the character of said machine has been introduced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;7.  That none of the machines seized by the City of Youngstown, as set forth in Stipulation No. 2 hereinabove, belongs to Plaintiff Garono. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;8.  That four (4) poker machines owned and leased to a third party by Plaintiff Garono, were seized by the Beaver Township Police within the past two months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;9.  That none of the poker machines owned and leased by Plaintiff Garono has yet been seized by the police departments of Youngstown, Struthers, or Campbell. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant municipalities appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Mahoning County (Ohio) affirming a lower court's issuance of a public injunction enjoining the municipalities and their officials from seizing poker machines owned, leased or operated by plaintiff vending company. The municipalities argued that the injunction interfered with their ability to enforce illegal gambling laws and that the machines were gambling devices per se.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The vending company sought a permanent injunction against the municipalities after they seized more than 60 of its video poker machines from area businesses. A lower court granted the injunction enjoining the municipalities from seizing the machines or making public statements that the machines were illegal gambling devices. The court of appeals held that because the machines were not illegal or gambling devices the police could be restrained from seizing the machines, but that the prohibition of public statements violated the municipalities' rights of free speech. The municipalities sought further review, arguing that the injunction interfered with their ability to enforce illegal gambling laws and that the machines were gambling devices per se. The court held that the video poker machines were gambling devices per se because they were used in connection with a game of chance. However, the court ruled that continued impoundment of the machines was unconstitutional because there was no evidence that they were used in an unlawful manner. The court reasoned that no one was ever arrested or charged with a violation with regard to the machines at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The reviewing court agreed that the video poker machines were gambling devices per se but approved the grant of an injunction to prevent the police from further impounding the vending company's machines because there was no evidence that they were used in an unlawful manner.</SPAN></P>

That action seeks to have declared unconstitutional those portions of R.C. 3769.08 and 3769.20 that grant tax abatements to race tracks for capital improvements and to enjoin current abatement under the statutes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Paul</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case was filed May 26, 1987.  The original defendants were the Ohio State Racing Commission, the Auditor of State, and the Treasurer of State.  On June 4, 1987, the racing commission moved for a change of venue to Franklin County and to join the relator racing associations as necessary parties.  By order of respondent, the relator racing associations were joined as parties on September 22, 1987 and, thereafter, some of them also moved for change of venue to Franklin County.  On November 25, 1987, respondent overruled all motions for change of venue stating: </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The racing associations filed a motion for change of venue in the trial court, which the trial judge denied.

The court concluded that the racing associations were entitled to a peremptory writ of prohibition prohibiting the trial judge from conducting further proceedings in the underlying case and a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the trial judge to transfer the case to a county of proper venue. The court explained that under Ohio R. Civ. P. 3(B)(1)-(6), venue was proper in a number of counties, but was not proper in Lawrence County, and that Ohio R. Civ. P. 3(C)(1) required the trial court to transfer the case to a county of proper venue, which the trial judge did not do. The court further found that an appeal of the venue order was not an adequate remedy at law because it did not offer a complete or speedy remedy to the racing associations. The court rejected the trial judge's waiver and laches defenses, concluding that the trial judge's waiver theory had no legal basis and that the trial judge did not show an unconscionable delay or prejudice in support of his laches argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, Nos. 87AP-124, 87AP-174 and 87AP-251. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy before this court today traces its origins to a contract dispute between appellee, the Central Ohio Transit Authority (&quot;COTA&quot;), and appellant, Local 208 of the Transport Workers Union of America (&quot;union&quot;).  When the parties were unable to agree, the union, whose membership includes persons employed by COTA, commenced a strike against COTA on December 9, 1986.  As a result, COTA bus service was suspended. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 6, 1987, COTA filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County seeking a determination, pursuant to R.C. 4117.16(A), that probable cause existed to believe that the strike might pose a &quot;clear and present danger to the public health or safety&quot; within the meaning of that statute.  The petition prayed for a seventy-two-hour temporary restraining order to enjoin the union from continuing the strike. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a hearing held on February 6, 7 and 8, the trial court announced its decision on February 8, 1987, finding that probable cause existed for a belief that the strike might pose a clear and present danger to the public health or safety within the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meaning of R.C. 4117.16(A).  Based upon this finding, the trial court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the union from the continuation of the strike for a period of seventy-two hours beginning February 10 at 12:01 a.m. The court further directed that &quot;* * * within that 72 hour period, the parties present to the Court the finding of the State Employment Relations Board with respect to whether the strike creates a clear and present danger to the health or safety of the public, and the Court retains jurisdiction to extend this temporary restraining order to issue an appropriate order or injunction under the provisions of &sect; 4117.16 in the event that the Board so finds.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For purposes of obtaining an extension of this order, COTA promptly requested a determination on this question from intervenor-appellant, the State Employment Relations Board (&quot;SERB&quot;), as required by R.C. 4117.16(A).  (COTA simultaneously filed an original action in prohibition in the court of appeals, seeking to prevent SERB from proceeding with such a determination, on the basis that R.C. 4117.16 is unconstitutional.  This original action was dismissed.  33 Ohio App. 3d 168, 514 N.E. 2d 946.) On February&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  12, after a hearing, SERB issued a determination that the strike did not pose a clear and present danger to the public health or safety.  Therefore, &quot;the statutory determination necessary to authorize an extension of the restraining order is denied.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same date it received this determination from SERB, COTA filed a motion &quot;for a hearing, temporary restraining order and sixty-day injunction order * * *&quot; in the court of common pleas.  In support of this motion, COTA argued that the grant of authority to SERB by R.C. 4117.16(A) constitutes an impermissible delegation of the trial court's inherent judicial power to an administrative agency contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 12, 1987, the trial court stated that R.C. 4117.16(A) appeared to be unconstitutional, and granted the parties fourteen days to file supplementary briefs on the constitutionality of the statute and the propriety of further injunctive relief.  The temporary restraining order previously issued was extended through that fourteen-day period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 27, 1987, the trial court announced its decision that R.C. 4117.16(A) was an unconstitutional delegation of judicial authority in violation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the separation of powers doctrine, in that it authorized SERB to &quot;direct, control and impede&quot; the trial court's jurisdiction and to block the court's exercise of its inherent equitable powers.  The court reasoned that the doctrine of separation of powers requires that the determination of an administrative agency must be subject to judicial review where, as here, that determination is an exercise of judicial power.  The court proceeded to assume jurisdiction on the basis that the statute, with the offending portions severed, would permit the court to retain jurisdiction &quot;over a request by a public employer to require striking workers to return to work when the interests of the public demand such relief.&quot; Upon a review of the evidence from both the SERB hearing and its own previous hearing, the court found that the strike posed a clear and present danger to the public health and safety.  On that basis, the court issued an order enjoining the strike for an additional sixty days.  Both the union and SERB appealed the February 27 judgment of the trial court.  The union had earlier appealed the trial court's judgment of February 12, whereby the court extended the original temporary &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  restraining order by fourteen days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals consolidated the two cases and issued a decision on March 18, 1987.  The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that R.C. 4117.16(A) is unconstitutional as a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers.  Specifically, the court of appeals held that the statute improperly grants SERB the power to terminate the jurisdiction of the trial court by finding no clear and present danger to the public health or safety; and that the statute impermissibly reduces the trial court to an agent of SERB by forcing the court to accept SERB's finding and act, or refrain from acting, solely in accordance with that finding.  The appellate court found that the offending portion of the statute was severable, and held that the trial court's resumption of jurisdiction under the remaining language of R.C. 4117.16(A) was consistent with the intentions of the legislature.  However, the appellate court reversed the lower court's finding that the strike posed a clear and present danger to the public health and safety, on the basis that there was no evidence properly before the court from which that determination could have been made. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No hearing had been held on this issue, nor was there any stipulation by the parties that the transcript of the hearing before SERB could be reviewed by the trial court.  The cause was remanded to the lower court for an evidentiary hearing or other appropriate action to afford the parties the opportunity to offer testimony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both SERB and the union appealed the judgment of the court of appeals, which judgment found R.C. 4117.16(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional, to this court.  (Case No. 87-655.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that appeal was pending, the trial court, upon remand, again found that the strike posed a clear and present danger to the public health and safety. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That finding was based on the evidence adduced at the prior probable cause hearing held by the trial court and at the hearing before SERB, the parties having stipulated to the admission of such evidence into the record. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Based upon this finding, the court held that the temporary restraining order previously issued should be continued for sixty days &quot;as provided in Section 4117.16(A).&quot; Upon appeal by the union, the court of appeals affirmed this judgment.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Butler County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case involves an appeal of the decision of the Court of Appeals for Butler County, which reversed a decision of the court of common pleas on the ground that former R.C. 4549.07 was vague and unconstitutional as applied to Charles R. Pierson, appellee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 7, 1983, Detective Rick Sizemore of the Butler County Sheriff's Department had occasion to be at the Pierson residence.  With Pierson's permission, Sizemore inspected a 1981 Dodge Ram Van which was parked in Pierson's driveway.  Sizemore observed that the Vehicle Identification Number (&quot;VIN&quot;) plate located on the van's dashboard was bent and appeared to have been tampered with.  Sizemore advised Pierson that he was leaving the premises to seek a warrant to search the van and asked Pierson not to move the vehicle.  As Sizemore left the Pierson residence, he observed Pierson enter the van, drive through an adjoining field and fence at the rear of his property and park the van at a neighbor's house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vehicle was then impounded by police and a search warrant obtained.  An inspection of the van showed that the confidential VIN, located on the frame of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicle underneath the passenger side, contained a partial VIN that did not correspond with the VIN plate attached to the dashboard.  In addition, the federal inspection sticker and the manufacturer's sticker, both of which would have shown the vehicle's VIN, had been removed from the van. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the VIN shown on the dashboard plate, Sizemore, after a title search, located a wrecked van in a junk yard in Spiceland, Indiana.  The wrecked van's VIN plate had been removed, but the confidential VIN found on that vehicle corresponded to the VIN plate attached to the van seized from Pierson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of Ohio, pursuant to R.C. 2933.41, filed an application in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County for an order of forfeiture and disposition of the van seized from Pierson.  On May 9, 1985, the trial court issued its decision which concluded that Pierson could not lawfully possess the van in question because the VIN had been removed, defaced or otherwise obliterated for the purpose of concealing and destroying the vehicle's true identity, a violation of R.C. 4549.07.  The trial court ordered the van forfeited to the Butler County Police Department to be used solely for the performance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of departmental duties.  Pierson filed a timely notice of appeal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 19, 1986, the court of appeals issued its decision, which, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sua sponte,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held that R.C. 4549.07 was vague and unconstitutional as applied to Pierson.  The court of appeals reversed the trial court's decision and ordered the state to return the van to Pierson. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luke Scargill and Bobby Lee Taylor were employees of Apex International Alloys, Inc., a metal manufacturing concern that is now known as Alumax, Inc., the appellee herein.  On August 25, 1981, as aluminum scrap was being fed into a crusher machine at Alumax, an explosion occurred which resulted in Taylor's death and serious injury to Scargill.  A personal injury and wrongful death suit was filed in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas by plaintiffs Scargill and Henry Taylor, administrator of the estate of his son, Bobby Taylor, against appellant, Academy Iron &amp; Metal Company, a Cleveland scrap dealer.  The suit alleged that Academy Iron sold dangerous and defective aluminum scrap to Scargill's and Taylor's employer and sought damages from the scrap dealer on theories of products liability.  Academy Iron denied the allegations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academy Iron filed an amended answer and brought a third-party complaint against Alumax, alleging that Bobby Taylor's death and Scargill's injuries were the result of &quot;intentional&quot; tortious acts by Alumax.  The third-party complaint sought indemnification from Alumax to Academy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Iron.  Academy Iron then moved for leave to amend its third-party complaint to allege a claim for contribution.  The trial court dismissed the third-party complaint, apparently, in part, on the grounds that Academy Iron had no standing to bring a third-party action against Alumax under Ohio workers' compensation law, implicitly disposing of the claim for contribution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, Academy Iron settled the claims of Taylor and Scargill, but it appealed the dismissal of the third-party complaint.  The court of appeals affirmed the dismissal, holding that the third-party complaint was precluded by R.C. 4121.80. </SPAN></P>

It held that the scrap metal dealer did not have standing to bring an indemnification claim against the employer, who was acting in compliance with the Ohio workers' compensation law, for damages suffered by the employees in the course of or arising out of their employment. The court further held that relief from common-law liability under the Ohio Workers' Compensation Act extended to cases in which a third-party tortfeasor, having paid damages to an employee or his estate, sought indemnity from the employer on the ground that the liability of the employer was primary or active and the liability of the third-party tortfeasor was secondary or passive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Summit County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 21, 1983, appellee Robert Van Fossen, an employee of appellant, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, a McDermott Company, was working on a gear-driven positioner manufactured by Aronson Machine Company.  A set of steps had been welded to the rear of the machine, leading up to a platform on which Van Fossen was working.  After working approximately one hour, Van Fossen, while backing down these steps, slipped and fell backwards.  He incurred serious injuries.  Based upon his injuries, Van Fossen applied for and apparently received workers' compensation benefits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject steps had been welded onto the platform in 1968 by David K. Bailey, a fellow employee of Van Fossen.  Bailey designed the steps and he installed them both for his own convenience and the convenience of others, at a time when he was assigned to use the machine.  He stated that he had never had any problem in the use of the steps, and that there had never been any expressions of concern about the steps from federal safety inspectors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 20, 1985, Van Fossen and his wife brought a tort action and an action for loss of consortium against Babcock&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &amp; Wilcox.  On February 25, 1986, Babcock &amp; Wilcox filed a motion for summary judgment.  In response, the Van Fossens averred, in effect, that the employer knew of the installation of the steps, knew that the steps were dangerous in that other employees had fallen from such steps, and yet continued to allow the use of the steps by its employees.  This, concluded the Van Fossens, constituted an intentional tort as enunciated by this court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Blankenship </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 608, 23 O.O. 3d 504, 433 N.E. 2d 572, and as further defined in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Jones </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. VIP Development Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 90, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E. 2d 1046, at paragraph one of the syllabus, to be &quot;an act committed with the intent to injure another, or committed with the belief that such injury is substantially certain to occur.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering the motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted the motion in favor of Babcock &amp; Wilcox.  In the court's view, reasonable minds could not conclude that the employer knew to a substantial certainty that an accident would occur from the use of the steps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Van Fossens filed a notice of appeal with the trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court on July 1, 1986.  Thereafter, Babcock &amp; Wilcox filed a cross-assignment of error in defense of its summary judgment.  Therein, Babcock &amp; Wilcox suggested as an alternative argument that even if issues of fact were presented which were relevant in light of prior case law, the judgment of the trial court should yet be affirmed on the basis of R.C. 4121.80, which became effective on August 22, 1986, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while the appeal was pending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 11, 1987, the court of appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment, finding that there was a justiciable issue of &quot;substantial certainty of proximate harm,&quot; and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employee slipped and fell when backing off steps that were welded to a machine that he was operating. The employee contended that the employer knew to a substantial certainty that an accident would occur from the use of the steps. The employer argued that a recent amendment to the Workers' Compensation Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(H), which placed more stringent conditions upon all employer-employee intentional tort actions, applied retrospectively to the action, which was pending in the court of appeals on the effective date of the amendment. The court agreed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(H) applied because a final judgment by the court of appeals was not entered when the statute became effective. Further, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(H) contained a clear legislative intent of retrospective application. However, because the statute imposed a more difficult statutory restriction upon the employee's ability to bring the instant action, its retrospective application was banned by the Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court also held that the employer's mere knowledge of a risk was not intent and did not support the intentional tort action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the court of appeals and reinstated the summary judgment in favor of the employer.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 1, 1980, Dyna Cure Precoated Steel, Inc. (&quot;Dyna Cure&quot;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Vesper Corporation, purchased the Cleveland Gear Division of Eaton Corporation.  Prior to that date Dyna Cure was not qualified to do business in Ohio and did not engage in business in Ohio.  This transaction involved the purchase of the assets of an entire manufacturing plant from Eaton which was located in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.  Dyna Cure purchased all the inventories of finished goods, partially finished goods, and raw materials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its 1981 personal property tax return, Dyna Cure reported the average monthly value of its manufacturing inventory on hand as of the last day of each of the four calendar months of September through December 1980, and divided that sum by twelve.  The appellee Tax Commissioner audited this return and recomputed the average monthly value by dividing the sum by four, the number of months that Dyna Cure conducted business in Ohio as a manufacturer in 1980. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its 1981 return, Eaton reported the average monthly value of inventory for the tax year by totalling month-end inventories for the eight months it held inventory&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at this plant, and divided that sum by twelve, the number of months that Eaton conducted business in Ohio as a manufacturer during 1980.  Eaton apparently continued in business in Ohio at another location in 1980 after its sale of the Cleveland Gear Division to Dyna Cure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average monthly value of the inventory of Dyna Cure increased from $ 2,752,371, as reported in the return, to $ 8,257,114 after audit by appellee.  The tax increased from $ 67,722 to $ 203,166. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dyna Cure changed its name to Cleveland Gear Company, hereinafter &quot;appellant,&quot; on or about February 1, 1982. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Board of Tax appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;) held that the statutes and prior case law directed that the inventory be valued in the manner in which appellee had determined it.  The BTA further declined to comment upon the constitutional implications in the application of the challenged statute ( R.C. 5711.16) because appellant had not challenged the statute at the first available opportunity, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the proceedings before appellee, citing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Bd. of Edn. of South-Western City Schools </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which affirmed an assessment by appellee Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner audited the taxpayer's return and recomputed the average monthly value of its manufacturing inventory, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5711.16, which increased the value of the inventory and the tax due.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer, which had not done business in Ohio previously, bought the inventory of an Ohio manufacturer in September. For its Ohio personal property tax return, the taxpayer reported the average monthly value of its manufacturing inventory on hand as of the last day of each of the four calendar months of September through December, and divided that sum by 12. The Commissioner audited the return and recomputed the average monthly value by dividing the sum by four, the number of months that the taxpayer had conducted business in Ohio as a manufacturer. The taxpayer argued that the valuation method of &sect; 5711.16 denied it equal protection of the laws because the corporation that it bought the inventory from was permitted to divide the total monthly inventories, which it held for eight months, by the 12 months that it was in business. The court affirmed. The court held that the taxpayer was paying the tax upon a correct valuation of its inventory; the selling corporation was paying a tax based upon inventory it no longer held. The taxpayer had not been denied equal protection of the law because it had not been unlawfully discriminated against.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Athens County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 23, 1974, appellee Vickie Collett gave birth out of wedlock to a daughter, appellee Brandie Rochelle Collett (nee Bartlett). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No father was listed on Brandie's original birth certificate. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Vickie's surname was Bartlett at the time of Brandie's birth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On September 26, 1977, Vickie married Charles Collett.  When Brandie began school, Vickie and Charles decided to have Brandie's surname changed from Bartlett to Collett.  They accomplished this by filing a duly notarized declaration of paternity with the Ohio Department of Health in July 1979.  In the declaration, Charles acknowledged that he was the natural father of Brandie.  Brandie was subsequently issued a new birth certificate indicating her surname to be Collett and listing Charles as her father.  Vickie and Charles subsequently dissolved their marriage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 30, 1984, Vickie filed an action under R.C. Chapter 3111 in the Athens County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, to determine the paternity of Brandie.  Vickie filed the action both on her own behalf and as next friend of her minor daughter, Brandie.  The complaint alleges that appellant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Darrell Cogar, is the father of Brandie, and asks that the court issue a judgment (1) establishing that Darrell is Brandie's father, (2) ordering him to pay $ 200 a month in child support and all her medical, dental and optical expenses until she reaches age eighteen, (3) ordering him to maintain a $ 10,000 life insurance contract for her benefit, and (4) granting Vickie $ 15,000 to recompense her for her pregnancy, confinement, and the support and necessaries she has furnished to Brandie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to an answer and a counterclaim, Darrell filed a third-party complaint on December 3, 1984, in which he claims he has reason to believe that either Randy Jackson or Charles Collett is the father of Brandie.  While being deposed, Vickie stated that Brandie was conceived between December 1973 and January 1974, at which time she had engaged in sexual intercourse with Darrell and Randy, but not with Charles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy and Darrell filed motions for summary judgment, which the trial court granted in a decision journalized on December 13, 1985.  The court of appeals reversed and remanded the cause for proceedings under R.C. Chapter 3111.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

The court of appeals remanded the matter for proceedings under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 3111.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mother gave birth to an out-of-wedlock child. No father was listed on the daughter's original birth certificate. The mother married third party defendant former husband, who filed a notarized declaration of paternity with the state health department. A new birth certificate was issued listing him as the child's father. The marriage was dissolved, and appellees filed an action against the alleged father under ch. 311 to determine paternity. Appellees also sought child support and reimbursement for support the mother had furnished to the daughter. The alleged father filed a third party complaint against the former husband and another individual. He was granted summary judgment, which was reversed on appeal. In affirming on appeal, the court held that the declaration of paternity signed by the former husband was not a final judgment. Thus, the doctrine of res judicata did not operate to bar the action under ch. 3111. Because no judgment was ever rendered on the issue of paternity, no retroactivity problem existed with respect to appellees' action under ch. 3111. The court of appeals correctly reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a determination of paternity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cases, consolidated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, involve appeals by appellants, Avon Lake City School District and Fort Frye Local School District, of public utility tax assessments made by appellee Tax Commissioner against appellee Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company and appellee Ohio Power Company, respectively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants listed several errors in their notices of appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;).  The two chief contentions were that the commissioner had undervalued the personal property of the utility companies and that the resulting apportionment of the taxable value thereof to appellants was incorrect.  Second, appellants asserted that the commissioner's rule, Ohio Adm. Code 5703-25-01, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was invalid as it was improperly promulgated and is injurious to appellants.  Also named as appellees were all the eighty-eight county auditors, none of whom has filed any documents in response to the appeals to the BTA or to this court. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Repealed effective October 20, 1986.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each case, the BTA bifurcated the appeal: one part dealing with the valuation of the subject property and one part dealing with the validity of the commissioner's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rule.  As to the former, the BTA dismissed the appeals brought pursuant to R.C. 5717.02, ruling that appellants did not have standing to file an appeal, and, as to the latter, the BTA retained jurisdiction of the appeals to await hearing for a review of the validity of the rule.  The BTA dismissed the utility companies as parties to the appeals brought pursuant to R.C. 5703.14.  Appellants appeal that portion of the orders which dismisses the appeals concerning the valuation of the utility companies, naming the commissioner, the utility companies, and the eighty-eight county auditors as appellees. </SPAN></P>

The Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio) dismissed the appeals brought pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.02 ruling that the school districts did not have standing to file an appeal. The school districts appealed the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The school districts contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.02 conferred jurisdiction upon the board to hear their appeal from the valuation of personal property, and apportionment of the taxable value thereof, of a utility company. The school districts also argued that the dismissals by the board deprived them of their right to due process of law under the Ohio and federal Constitutions. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5727.23 did not require that the school districts received notice of the apportioned values and assessments. Thus, because they were not required to be notified by law of the final determination of the commissioner, they were not within that class of persons authorized to appeal her determinations. The court held that the term &quot;any person interested therein&quot; as used in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5727.10 meant a person interested in the public utility and not a person interested in the assessment. Finally, the court held that a school district was a political subdivision created by the General Assembly, and it could not assert any constitutional protections regarding due course of law or due process of law against the State, its creator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to an increasing number of citizen complaints involving allegations of police misconduct, the Cleveland City Council passed an emergency ordinance, Ordinance No. 1397-84, on September 5, 1984, to place a proposed city charter amendment on the ballot at the November 6, 1984 election.  The preamble to the ordinance stated that the ordinance was &quot;an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, and safety in that it must be certified to the election authorities immediately in order for the question to appear at a special election to be held on November 6, 1984 * * *.&quot; Section 5 of the ordinance declared that it was to be effective immediately upon passage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the charter amendment was to establish a police review board and to create the Office of Professional Standards within the office of the Director of Public Safety.  The new office would have an administrator who would assist the police review board.  The review board would &quot;receive, cause investigation of, and recommend resolution of complaints&quot; filed with it alleging police misconduct.  The board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would also be authorized to adopt rules and procedures for the processing of complaints.  These rules and regulations, however, would be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Safety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the charter amendment, the administrator of the Office of Professional Standards would be authorized to cause investigation of complaints filed with the board and to report the results of these investigations to the board.  The police review board would then decide that the complaint warranted no further action, or that the complaint should be resolved by the Director of Public Safety.  The board could alternatively decide that disciplinary action is warranted and make such a recommendation to the chief of police.  With one exception described below, if the chief decided to initiate charges against a police officer (suspend the officer) and if the review board concurred, the existing disciplinary procedure would apply and the matter would go before the Director of Public Safety for hearing and &quot;judgment.&quot; If the police review board did not agree with the chief's decision, then the board itself could initiate disciplinary action against the police officer.  However, all charges initiated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the board would be certified to the Director of Public Safety, who is required to hold a hearing and render judgment.  As is presently the case, the Director of Public Safety could decide that no discipline is warranted, or he could suspend, reduce in rank, or dismiss the officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charter amendment would modify existing provisions of the charter to provide that all decisions by the chiefs of police and fire to suspend a police officer or firefighter for ten days or less would be final and, therefore, not reviewable by the Director of Public Safety.  The Director of Public Safety could employ hearing officers to conduct disciplinary hearings on his behalf, but all authority to make disciplinary decisions would be retained by the director. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the charter amendment would clearly state that the city civil service commission would entertain appeals by suspended employees in the city's classified civil service only if the suspensions are for more than ten days.  Suspensions of ten days or less are not appealable to the civil service commission under the existing provisions of the charter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance, with the proposed charter amendments, was introduced and read for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  first time at the city council's meeting on June 4, 1984.  Subsequently, the public safety, legislation, and finance committees of council held public hearings on the ordinance.  The ordinance was read again at the September 5 meeting.  Council then voted fifteen to zero to suspend the rule requiring the ordinance to be read on three separate days.  The ordinance was then read a third time and was passed by a vote of fifteen to zero. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clerk of council forwarded a certified copy of the ordinance to the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections on September 7, 1984.  The clerk later sent a proposed ballot title summarizing the charter amendment question to the board of elections on September 17, 1984.  On October 5, 1984, the board of elections evidently approved the ballot summary language and adopted a resolution placing the proposed charter amendment on the next ballot.  The ballot title language </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was subsequently approved by the Secretary of State, and the charter amendment was adopted by the voters of the city of Cleveland on November 6, 1984. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Ratner, Trustee for Forest City Enterprises, Inc. (&quot;taxpayer&quot;), purchased the Mellett Mall in Stark County on September 30, 1981.

This total amount, $ 12,540,500, was stated by the BTA to be reflective of the true value of the property in its earlier decision of April 15, 1985, where it determined that the fair market value of the property was $ 12,530,000.  Upon appeal, this court reversed and remanded this decision and directed the board to consider, at least, independent appraisal evidence which adjusts the sale price to reflect the price paid for the property and the price paid for the favorable financing.  The tax lien date under review in this case is January 1, 1981, nine months prior to the date of sale. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Leatha Wright (hereinafter &quot;Wright&quot;) is the mother of appellant Andrea Wright (hereinafter &quot;Andrea&quot;).  Andrea was born on June 1, 1978.  In January 1980, Wright brought a paternity action under Ohio's old &quot;bastardy&quot; law against appellee, Danny Oliver (hereinafter &quot;Oliver&quot;), based on allegations that Oliver was Andrea's father.  The complaint was dismissed in July 1981. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wright refiled the action on July 1, 1985.  The action was filed pursuant to the new Parentage Act set out in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3111.  Wright requested a judgment that Oliver was Andrea's father.  Andrea was also a plaintiff in the refiled action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver denied Wright's allegations and requested summary judgment on the grounds of laches.  He contended laches was appropriate because Wright delayed refiling the action four years.  Oliver claimed the four-year delay caused his case to be materially prejudiced.  The basis of his claim of material prejudice was that three of his supporting witnesses were no longer available and that he incurred substantial obligations which he would not have undertaken but for the delay. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A referee of the juvenile court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  denied Oliver's summary judgment motion on September 26, 1985.

The court held that laches could be applicable in parentage actions filed prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, but only if appellee could show material prejudice.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Nathan N. Stambaugh, was operating a motor vehicle on October 18, 1985, when he was stopped by an Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper and cited for driving with an expired driving license in violation of R.C. 4507.02.  Appellee entered a plea of guilty in Maumee Municipal Court and subsequently was fined and assessed costs.  Stambaugh was ordered to furnish proof of financial responsibility pursuant to R.C. 4509.101.

The court, after applying the rules of construction to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101, and after a careful reading of the statute, concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4509.101(B)(1), (B)(2)(b) were constitutional and valid. The appellate court erred when it found that the section was unconstitutional in that it gave an administrative officer authority to review a court's determination.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From January 1950 to July 1967, appellee, Robert Dreger, was employed as a volunteer member of the North Ridgeville, Ohio, Fire Department.  In June 1959, he became an employee of the town's street department.  At this time, he began contributing to the Public Employees Retirement System (&quot;PERS&quot;), pursuant to R.C. 145.03.  He continued to contribute to PERS until August 1967, at which point he ceased work for the street department and became a full-time employee of the fire department.  He then became a contributing member of the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund (&quot;PFDPF&quot;), pursuant to R.C. 742.01(B) and 742.31. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1967, PERS notified Dreger that, according to the provisions of R.C. 145.02, as then effective, he was ineligible to maintain membership in PERS.  When PERS terminated his membership, however, Dreger did not seek a refund of his accumulated contributions.  He continued to contribute to PFDPF until his retirement in August 1982 as Chief of the North Ridgeville Fire Department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1975, Dreger was informed by the retirement supervisor of PFDPF that he could receive service credit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for his work as a volunteer fireman from 1950 to 1967.  However, on June 30, 1975, the board of trustees of PFDPF passed a resolution stating that service credit would only be given for full-time service.  This resolution was subsequently promulgated as Ohio Adm. Code 742-5-01, effective January 1, 1977.  In March 1978, PFDPF notified Dreger of this change and denied him credit for his part-time service as a volunteer fireman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1982, Dreger applied to PERS for a retirement allowance.  PERS denied his application in March 1982, stating he was ineligible for benefits under R.C. 145.02, and sent him a refund check for his accumulated contributions pursuant to R.C. 145.40. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1982, PFDPF informed Dreger that he was ineligible for service credit for his years with the street department, since his service at the time was covered by PERS.  Dreger then applied for and accepted retirement from PFDPF, pursuant to R.C. 742.37(C)(1). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1983, Dreger filed suit against PERS, PFDPF and others.  The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas granted Dreger's motion for summary judgment on January 7, 1986.  The trial court ordered PERS to accept return of Dreger's accumulated&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  contributions and to issue him a retirement allowance, having found R.C. 145.02 to be unconstitutional on its face.  The trial court also ordered PFDPF to give Dreger service credit for his years of service as a volunteer fireman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  It upheld the trial court's finding that Dreger's membership was improperly terminated by PERS, although it did not reach the constitutional issue.  It reversed the lower court on the issue of service credit, however, holding that Dreger has a right to purchase service credit from PERS, rather than receive it from PFDPF, for his years of service as a volunteer fireman. </SPAN></P>

PERS notified the fireman that he was ineligible to maintain membership in PERS. PFDPF denied the fireman credit for his part-time service as a volunteer fireman. The court initially held that the action was not barred by the six-year statute of limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.07 because the cause of action did not accrue until PERS denied his application for a retirement allowance. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 145.02 did not require the termination of the pre-existing membership in PERS of a person who began contributing to PFDPF. Instead, the statute was only intended to exclude the initial membership in PERS of a person who was contributing to PFDPF. Thus, PERS improperly terminated the fireman's pre-existing membership. Finally, any right the fireman had for service credit for his work as a volunteer fireman had to be established under the guidelines of PERS because PFDPF had no authority beyond that which was conferred by statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 4, 1983, at approximately 6:00 p.m., decedent Louis Vargo was southbound on I-77 in Stark County, Ohio, when the vehicle he was operating swerved off the roadway into the median strip.  The car continued its southerly course within the median strip for approximately fifty to seventy-five yards, then swerved abruptly back to the right, crossing both southbound lanes of I-77, climbing an embankment, crashing through a wire fence and proceeding in a straight line through a cornfield until striking a tree approximately nine hundred to thirteen hundred feet from the roadway. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decedent received cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the scene.  The resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The speed at impact was estimated to be approximately thirty miles per hour.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florence Vargo, the decedent's widow and appellee herein, sought thereafter to obtain insurance proceeds under a policy of insurance issued to decedent's employer, Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Company, and pursuant to which decedent was an insured.  The policy was issued by Travelers Insurance Company, appellant herein.  Appellant denied coverage on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  basis that the decedent had suffered his heart attack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">prior</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the collision with the tree, and that its policy provided coverage only if the insured sustained bodily injury or death through accidental means directly and independently of all other causes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;If an insured Employee or an insured Employee's Dependent while covered under this Part shall sustain bodily injury not hereinafter excepted effected directly and independently of all other causes through accidental means, and if such injury shall result within Three Hundred Sixty-five days of the date of accident, in any One of the losses enumerated below, the Company will pay, subject to the provisions and limitations hereinafter contained and the Indemnity Limits set forth below, the sum set opposite such loss. </SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  thereupon filed the instant suit to compel payment of the insurance proceeds pursuant to the insurance contract.  At trial, appellee utilized a medical expert in an attempt to establish that the decedent fell asleep at the wheel, woke up when the car left the roadway, then &quot;froze&quot; out of panic and suffered a heart attack as a result of the adrenaline surge.  Conversely, appellant utilized three medical experts, the chief deputy coroner who performed the autopsy on decedent, a pathologist, and a cardiologist, who all testified that the heart attack was, without the involvement of external factors, caused by the decedent's degenerative heart disease.  To further support its position, appellant introduced the coroner's report and death certificate which both reflect that the cause of death was &quot;acute massive myocardial infarction due to or as a consequence of atherosclerotic heart disease.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a unanimous verdict for appellant and the trial court entered judgment upon the verdict.  Upon appeal, the court of appeals vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for a new trial on the basis that R.C. 313.19 was unconstitutional and deprived a party of due process&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by compelling the jury to accept, as a matter of law, the coroner's opinion as to the manner and mode of death, thus, in effect, directing the verdict for appellant herein.  Additionally, the court of appeals reversed on the basis that the trial court erred by permitting one of appellant's medical experts to testify both to matters beyond the scope of his expertise and to testify with the aid of irrelevant, prejudicial statistical evidence. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The decedent drove across a highway median and struck a tree. The coroner's report stated that the decedent died of a heart attack. At trial, a jury verdict was awarded to the insurance company. On appeal, the lower court reversed, and held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.19 was unconstitutional and deprived the wife of due process by compelling the jury to accept, as a matter of law, the coroner's opinion as to the manner and mode of death; thus, in effect, directing the verdict for the insurance company. The court disagreed, reversed the judgment of the lower court, and reinstated the verdict of the trial court. The court held that &sect; 313.19 did not mandate a jury verdict for the insurance company, but created in the coroner's report and death certificate a non-binding, rebuttable presumption of the decedent's cause of death in the absence of competent, credible evidence to the contrary. The court held that &sect; 313.19 did not violate due process because the wife had the opportunity, through medical testimony, to rebut the coroner's report that the decedent died a non-accidental death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, reinstated the judgment of the trial court in favor of the insurance company, and held that the coroner's report, pursuant to statutory law, did not direct a verdict for the insurance company in its claim that the decedent died by non-accidental means, and that his wife was not entitled to his accidental death coverage. The court held that the coroner's report created a rebuttable presumption.</SPAN></P>

The compliance deadline was later extended to October 17, 1983 and then extended again to November 17, 1983.  In addition to extending the compliance deadlines, appellee simultaneously reduced the compliance requirements from complete reclamation to &quot;complet[ing] all physical work necessary to establish a successful cover of permanent vegetation.&quot; At no time during the period July 19, 1983 to November 22, 1983, the date noncompliance was determined, did appellant appeal either NOV No. 3918, pursuant to R.C. 1513.13(A)(1), or request extensions of the compliance deadline contained therein, pursuant to Ohio Adm.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 30, 1980, plaintiff-appellant, Evelyn Y. Gaines, went to defendant-appellee, Preterm-Cleveland, Inc., a health care facility, for the dual purpose of having her pregnancy terminated and her intrauterine device (&quot;IUD&quot;) removed.  The pertinent medical records indicate that the abortion was successfully completed.  The IUD was not recovered, apparently because it could not be located, although the records reflect an estimate by the physician of its possible location. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her complaint, and in the evidence presented to the trial court, appellant alleged that agents or employees of appellee &quot;negligently failed to remove the IUD&quot; as requested by appellant.  Moreover, appellant alleged that she &quot;was told by employees or agents of * * * [appellee] Preterm </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">that the IUD had been removed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; (Emphasis added.) The complaint further stated that &quot;[i]n reliance on the misrepresentations of the employees or agents of * * * [appellee] Preterm as alleged above, * * * [appellant] did not seek further medical attention in order to remove the IUD.&quot; Appellant alleged that &quot;[a]s a result of * * * [appellee] &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Preterm's negligence in failing to remove the IUD and misrepresenting to * * * [appellant] that the IUD had been removed, * * * [appellant] suffered great physical pain and emotional distress, underwent an operation to remove the IUD, received medical attention and will continue to receive medical attention the rest of her natural life, will suffer great pain of body and mind for the rest of her natural life, and was permanently scarred.&quot; Appellant asserted that she did not discover that the IUD remained in her body until she underwent a tubal ligation on October 18, 1983, nearly three and one-half years after the Preterm procedure.  At that time, appellant's new physician discovered that the IUD had not been removed, but had perforated appellant's uterus and become embedded in her left ligament.  On October 16, 1984, appellant notified appellee pursuant to the second paragraph of R.C. 2305.11(A) (the one-hundred-eighty-day notice) that she was considering instituting an action stemming from professional services rendered to her.  On April 11, 1985, appellant filed suit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee moved for summary judgment on June 12, 1985, arguing that appellant's action was barred by the four-year&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statute of repose for medical malpractice suits embodied in R.C. 2305.11(B).  The trial court granted the motion and entered judgment for appellee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed, holding that appellant's medical malpractice action was time-barred under R.C. 2305.11(B), since her complaint was filed more than four years after the act or omission constituting the alleged malpractice occurred.  The court rejected appellant's argument that her allegations stated an independent cause of action in fraud and that such action was timely filed under R.C. 2305.09, the statute of limitations for fraud.  The appellate court reasoned that the &quot;gist&quot; of appellant's allegations was medical malpractice and that the statute of limitations for fraud does not apply. </SPAN></P>

The court also found that the patient's complaint was timely filed under the statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.09, applicable to such a fraud action. The court then noted that Ohio's statute of repose, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B), had been declared unconstitutional as to some but not all medical malpractice litigants. The court then compared the operation of &sect; 2305.11(B) to the court's interpretation of Ohio Rev.

Because of these outstanding advances, the effective federal tax rate on Ohio employers had increased each year, beginning in 1982, due to reduction in the state credits to offset the tax.  Moreover, the state&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has paid interest on the advances, from the General Fund each year, beginning in 1982. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of Am. Sub. H.B. No. 171, effective July 1, 1987, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 4141.251 and 4141.48.  R.C. 4141.48 directs the Treasurer of the state of Ohio to issue bonds on and after October 1, 1987, to repay outstanding advances made by the federal government to the Ohio unemployment compensation program, to pay interest on advances, and to reimburse the General Fund for interest paid since July 1, 1987.  The bonds are to be issued upon the determination of the Director of Budget and Management that they would be &quot;cost-effective.&quot; ( R.C. 4141.48[B].) The bonds are not to constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the state, and the statute declares that bondholders would have no right to have money raised by taxation obligated or pledged to support them, only a right to have bond service charges paid from a &quot;surcharge,&quot; enacted under R.C. 4141.251, on employer &quot;contributions,&quot; R.C. 4141.48(C).  Section 126 of Am. Sub. H.B. No. 171 provides that if no bonds are issued by November 9, 1987, or the issuance of the bonds has been declared unconstitutional or otherwise prohibited&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by a court, then a surcharge shall be levied on employer contributions for payment of outstanding and future interest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, the Director of Budget and Management, has made a determination that the issuance of such bonds in the principal amount of $ 315,400,000 would be cost-effective, but respondent, the Treasurer of the state of Ohio, has refused to issue the bonds, citing provisions of Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution and prior decisions of this court prohibiting the incurrence of indebtedness. </SPAN></P>

However, employers who paid into an approved state program were granted credits. Ohio operated such a program. 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1321 et seq., provided for advances of federal funds to state programs. Ohio received advances from the federal government. The General Assembly enacted statutes that directed the Treasurer to issue bonds to repay the outstanding advances. The Treasurer declined to issue the bonds and the Director commenced a mandamus action. The court held that the proposed bond issuance violated Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1, 3. The exception to the debt prohibition applied only to debt that was outstanding when the constitution was drafted. Additionally, the proposed bond issuance was not authorized by the judicially created &quot;special fund&quot; exception to Ohio Const. art. VIII because no property was constructed or acquired.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Billy Penix, a.k.a. Bill Davis, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was indicted by the Clark County Grand Jury for aggravated murder with a death penalty specification that the murder was committed while he was committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, and for robbery, aggravated robbery, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse in the death of Stephen Barker.  Barker died of severe head injuries on August 21, 1982, and his body was found in the trunk of his car in a garage behind appellee's house.  Appellee's fingerprints were found on the trunk and a baseball bat covered with blood was found in appellee's house. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Appellee's mother's last name was Davis, and he was known to some neighbors and aquaintances as Bill Davis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appellee met Barker the night of his death when Barker hailed the car in which appellee and several others were traveling and asked directions to a local bar.  Appellee and the others escorted Barker to the bar and stood&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the parking lot talking with him, drinking beer and smoking marijuana.  Several witnesses testified that appellee noticed a money bag in Barker's car and then had a discussion with his friend, Jeff Finney.  Appellee, however, stated that Finney first noticed the money bag or box and suggested robbing Barker.  Appellee and the others joined Barker in the bar a little later, and they drank together at that bar and other locations for several hours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the evening, Barker indicated that he needed a place to stay for the night, and appellee invited Barker to stay with him.  Appellee, Barker, and the others then proceeded to appellee's home.  Barker, who had been drinking heavily, fell asleep on the couch soon after they arrived at the house, and, apparently, appellee, Finney, and possibly some of the others again discussed robbing him.  A short time later, while Barker was still sleeping, appellee hit him on the head with an aluminum baseball bat, and took his wallet and keys.  Jeff Finney then took the money from Barker's wallet and departed with the others, leaving appellee alone with Barker. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the others left, appellee dragged the body out of the house and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  placed it in the trunk of Barker's car.  Later, when Finney and the others returned, they assisted appellee in pushing the car into a garage on the premises. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a jury trial, appellee was convicted of aggravated murder with accompanying death specification, aggravated robbery, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury recommended that appellee be sentenced to death, which recommendation was accepted by the trial court. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee appealed his conviction and sentence raising numerous assignments of error, including an assertion that the court erred in charging the jury in the penalty phase.  The court of appeals upheld the conviction, but reversed the sentence, finding that the trial erred in its charge to the jury in the penalty phase.  The cause was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court granted review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Clark County (Ohio) that upheld appellee's conviction for aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse, but vacated the sentence of death because of an error in the jury charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellee was convicted of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, tampering with the evidence, and abuse of a corpse and the jury imposed the death penalty. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction but vacated the death sentence. The court affirmed that the jury was erroneously charged during the penalty phase of the proceeding. Because appellee was found to be the actual murderer, the principal offender, the jury should not have been instructed to consider whether the crimes were committed with prior calculation and design when assessing aggravating factors. Prior calculation and design were aggravating factors only when the offender was not the principal offender. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.14 limited the aggravating circumstances that could be considered in imposing the death penalty to those specifically enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(A), otherwise the magnitude of aggravating factors could wrongfully outweigh any mitigating circumstances presented. The court held that upon re-sentencing the new jury could not consider the death penalty because appellee was entitled to have that sentencing recommendation made only by the same jury that had convicted appellee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals that vacated the imposition of the death penalty against appellee. The jury instructions presented during the penalty phase erroneously advised the jury to consider too many aggravating factors, which were then weighed against mitigating circumstances. Upon resentencing, the new jury would not be permitted to consider a sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a planned effort to restore vitality to its commercial areas, defendant-appellee, city of Lakewood, adopted a sign ordinance placing controls on preexisting, previously unregulated signs located in commercial areas.  Because the city determined that some commercial signs constituted a blight that impeded revitalization of declining commercial areas, Ordinance No. 58-79 amended Chapter 1329 of the Codified Ordinances of the city of Lakewood, effective July 16, 1979, to impose consistent design, size, location, and illumination standards for all types of signs erected in the city.  Although subject to variances, the ordinance requires sign owners to modify or remove preexisting nonconforming signs in order to achieve compliance within a five and one-half year period ending January 1, 1985, and provides for penalties of up to $ 200 per day for violations of the ordinance.  Ordinance No. 52-85, enacted after the decision of the trial court below, amended Chapter 1329 to further declare that all existing nonconforming signs were nuisances. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Section 1329.01 of the Codified Ordinances of the city of Lakewood (&quot;Intent&quot;) was revised to state in subsection (f): &quot;In establishing these objectives the City has determined that, without adequate regulation and design standards, signs are a nuisance.  The number of signs in Lakewood is excessive and is unduly distracting to motorist [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">] and pedestrians, creates a traffic hazard, and in some places reduces the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public.  As the appearance of the City is marred by the excessive number, oversized and poorly designed signs, both residential and business property values are adversely affected.  Therefore, the number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced and signs permitted should comply with the standards of this Code in order to reduce the aforementioned effects. &quot;The signs of least value to the people of Lakewood are those which carry commercial messages other than the advertisement of any product, service, event, person, institution, or business located on the premise[s] where the sign is located. &quot;In view of the foregoing, all signs not conforming with the provisions of this Chapter are hereby declared a nuisance.  It is further declared that the regulations contained in this Code are the minimum regulation necessary to abate the nuisance and to achieve the purposes of this Code.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The cases were consolidated for trial and on appeal, and are now before this court. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the ordinance, as applied to preexisting, otherwise lawful, nonconforming signs, constitutes an unconstitutional taking of property in violation of their due process rights; that the ordinance exceeds the city's home rule powers granted in Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution; and that the ordinance conflicts with the prohibition of R.C. 713.15 against retroactive zoning ordinances.  Plaintiffs also seek a permanent injunction against enforcement of the ordinance and its penalties. The trial court rendered judgment for the city, declaring that the ordinance, as applied, is constitutional; is a proper exercise of Lakewood's police power; and, as a building code ordinance, is not in conflict with R.C. 713.15.  The court of appeals affirmed. The causes are now before this court&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  upon the allowance of motions to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the ordinance clearly beared a real and substantial relationship to the safety and general welfare of the public. The businesses failed to meet their burden of proving that the ordinance was unconstitutional, unreasonable or arbitrary, and the court found the ordinance to have been a valid exercise of municipal police power to protect the safety and general welfare of the public from a nuisance.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of March 2, 1985, Mario L. Trevino, age twelve, was killed in Cleveland, Ohio.  The victim, five feet, two inches tall, and weighing ninety-three pounds, had been savagely beaten to death. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The record reveals the following sequence of events which preceded this tragic conclusion. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The cause of death was described as &quot;multiple blunt impacts to the head and blunt crushing impacts to the trunk with multiple visceral or organ injuries.&quot; The totality of the injuries inflicted upon the boy was described as being as extensive as that &quot;* * * [associated] * * * with * * * [the] type of trauma * * * [normally seen] in automobile accidents, * * *,&quot; including numerous bruises and contusions, multiple incision wounds, a hairline fracture of the skull, dislocated right collarbone, two fractured ribs, massive injuries to the chest wall, bruising and tearing of the left lung, and a tearing of the liver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appellant, Alfred J. Morales, stands&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  five feet, eight inches tall, weighs two hundred twenty pounds, and is an expert in the martial arts.  The Trevino family, Mario being the youngest male member, had known appellant for many years prior to the evening of March 2, 1985.  Through their acquaintanceship with appellant, the Trevinos were well aware of appellant's skill in the martial arts and of his ability to use a variety of weapons for their intended purposes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a time, Jesse Trevino, the victim's older brother, and appellant had been friends.  This friendship ended at a previous time when Jesse refused to commit perjury for appellant, thereby depriving appellant of an alibi regarding the theft of a taxicab.  As a result of Jesse's refusal, appellant pled guilty to the theft offense and was returned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the Mansfield Reformatory. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;Appellant had been released on probation from the Mansfield Reformatory shortly before the taxicab incident.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in the Mansfield Reformatory, appellant wrote threatening letters to Toby Trevino, brother&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of both Jesse and Mario.  The letters suggested revenge upon the whole Trevino family, including Yolanda Trevino, sister of Jesse, Toby and Mario, who had previously refused to become appellant's girlfriend.  The envelope of one letter contained both a drawing and the letters &quot;D.W.C.S.,&quot; &quot;B.W.&quot; and &quot;D.O.D.&quot; The letters were later shown to mean &quot;Death Will Come Soon,&quot; &quot;Beware&quot; and &quot;Demon of Darkness,&quot; a name appellant used for himself.  The drawing on this envelope depicts a heart pierced by a sword.  Toby Trevino's name is printed on the heart and blood is dripping from the tip of the sword.  The envelope of the second letter likewise contained a drawing.  The second drawing depicts a skull, dripping blood, with a sword passing through it.  Beneath the skull is printed the word &quot;DANGER.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 19, 1985, appellant was released from the Mansfield Reformatory.  During the three-week period between appellant's release and Mario's murder, appellant was observed watching the Trevino home while hiding in the bushes of a house near the Trevinos' residence.  During this same time period, appellant stated to a variety of witnesses that he was &quot;going to kill Toby's ass,&quot; that &quot;he had&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  some killing to do and that he knew he was going back to where he came from,&quot; and that &quot;he had * * * a killing to do, and [that] he knew he was going back * * * [a]nd he didn't care.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of his death, Mario left home some time after 6:00 p.m. to play video games at a nearby store.  After leaving the store, Mario was confronted by appellant who told Mario that he wanted to talk with him regarding the problems between appellant and the Trevino family.  Mario accompanied appellant from the store to a secretive location, approximately one and one-half to two miles from the store.  It was at this location that appellant murdered Mario. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the murder, appellant went to the nearby home of an acquaintance to wash the blood from his hands and apply ice to his knuckles to control the swelling.  When appellant left that location, he left behind the towel containing the ice for his knuckles and his blood-stained white shirt.  Soon after appellant's departure, the towel and blood-stained shirt were turned over to the authorities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later the same evening, appellant was confronted by Jesse and Toby Trevino who, having learned that Mario had been seen in the company of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant, questioned appellant as to Mario's whereabouts.  Appellant responded: &quot;I haven't seen Mario,&quot; &quot;I'm not taking the rap for nothing I didn't do, man,&quot; and &quot;[y]ou know, the next time I go into jail, it's going to be for murder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early the next morning, March 3, 1985, Mario's body was discovered.  While notifying the Trevinos of Mario's death, the authorities were informed of the threatening letters sent by appellant.  Appellant was subsequently arrested and his home searched.  The search produced a jacket and shoes which were still wet from having recently been washed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being informed of his constitutional rights, appellant therein provided police with both oral and written statements concerning the death of Mario.  In both the oral and written statements, appellant admitted that he had confronted the boy at the beverage store, led him to the secluded location and then brutally beat the child, leaving Mario to die. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was subsequently indicted for kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01, aggravated murder with prior calculation and design in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B)&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the specification that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the crime was committed while appellant was committing or attempting to commit the offense of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01.  At his arraignment, appellant entered pleas of not guilty to all the offenses charged.  These pleas were all subsequently changed to pleas of not guilty by reason of insanity. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3&nbsp;The proper numerical designation for aggravated murder with prior calculation and design is R.C. 2903.01(A).  Although the numerical designation listed in the indictment is incorrect, the language of the indictment makes it clear that appellant was charged with aggravated murder.  The indictment is in the language of R.C. 2903.01(A).  Further, Crim. R. 7(B) provides in part that: &quot;* * * Each count of the indictment or information shall state the numerical designation of the statute which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Error in the designation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> or its omission </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">shall not be ground for dismissal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> of the indictment or information, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">or for reversal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> of a conviction, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">if the error</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> or omission </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.&quot; (Emphasis added.)

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which convicted him of kidnapping in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, defendant alleged, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal with respect to the charge of kidnapping and the corresponding specification. Defendant contended that there was no evidence of a kidnapping. The court noted that the victim was 12 years old and that under &sect; 2905.01(A), the use of threats, force, or deception was not essential to a conviction of kidnapping a child under the age of 13. However, there was evidence that defendant utilized deception to get the victim to accompany him. The court noted that defendant had threatened the victim's family, including the victim, and that reasonable minds could conclude that defendant used subterfuge to decoy the victim away from a public location. Further, evidence of the deception provided support for the jury's finding that defendant had removed the victim for the purpose of committing a felony or inflicting injury. The court also held that photographs of the victim after his death were probative with regard to the showing of defendant's intent and deliberation and that the sentence of death was properly imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sole issue before this court is the constitutionality of R.C. 5735.145 which provides a tax credit for Ohio producers of ethanol, and R.C. 5735.145(B) which grants the tax credit to out-of-state producers of ethanol if their state grants a reciprocal tax credit, exemption or refund for Ohio-produced ethanol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio requires motor vehicle fuel dealers to pay a tax on all motor vehicle fuel sold.  R.C. 5735.145 grants a tax credit to fuel dealers who distribute and sell gasoline to which has been added ten percent by volume of ethanol, commonly referred to as &quot;gasohol.&quot; The tax credit is twenty-five cents per gallon of ethanol used, thus making the cost of a gallon of gasohol two and one-half cents cheaper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, New Energy Company&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Indiana, produces ethanol at its plant in South Bend, Indiana.  New Energy brought this action to enjoin the Tax Commissioner from implementing or enforcing R.C. 5735.145 on the grounds that it improperly burdened interstate commerce.  New Energy claimed that since Indiana does not have a reciprocal ethanol tax credit, it does not benefit from the tax credit under R.C. 5735.145(B), and thus it cannot compete in the Ohio market.  New Energy contended the statute discriminates against out-of-state producers, is an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce, and is an attempt at forced reciprocity. </SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that because its state did not have a reciprocal ethanol tax credit, it did not benefit from the tax credit under &sect; 5735.145(B) and thus could not compete in the state market. The trial and appellate courts held that the statute did not burden interstate commerce, and upon rehearing, the court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 5735.145 was not protectionist in either its purpose or effect, and that its enactment was rationally related to a legitimate state interest in conserving energy. The court held that although the statute had an adverse effect on the taxpayer, the fact that the burden of the statute fell on some interstate companies did not, by itself, establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce. Because the statute did not give an advantage solely to state producers, it was not unreasonably burdensome on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present controversy involves an action to contest what purports to be the last will and testament of Robert B. Gardner.  Gardner died on January 25, 1967.  An application to probate the aforementioned will was filed on January 30, 1967, naming, as next of kin, Gardner's grandson, Frederick B. Palazzi, Jr., appellant herein.  The application discloses that the applicant-executor was aware of both the identity and address of appellant (Ashland, North Carolina).  Nevertheless, no notice of the proceeding was sent thereto. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant alleges that he did not become aware of the death of his grandfather &quot;until 1984.&quot; On April 29, 1985, he instituted the present action (later amended) claiming that the notice requirements of the Ohio Probate Code and the parallel provisions of the Ohio Revised Code relating to service of process are unconstitutional as applied to nonresident heirs.  It is also his contention that the will submitted to probate was not the actual last will and testament of Robert B. Gardner.  In the alternative, appellant sought construction of the will as it applies to him. </SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (Ohio) affirmed the probate court's ruling, which granted the relatives' motion to dismiss the grandson's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The grandson contended that the notice requirement relating to service of process in probate matters, contained at Ohio Rev.

The relatives argued that the grandson failed to allege any service-by-publication of notice to establish the will in issue and thus failed to show that &sect; 2107.13 was relevant. The court held that the grandson was barred from challenging the decedent's will. In so holding, the court found that 1) due process demanded that timely notice be given to heirs during the pendency of a probate proceeding; 2) the status of the grandson as a contingent beneficiary supported his assertion that he possessed a property interest entitled to due process protection; 3) the grandson could not assert a constitutional challenge to the notice provision of &sect; 2107.13 claiming a denial of due process when he possessed actual knowledge of the facts which form the basis of the notice; 4) the grandson failed to place himself within the class injured by any unconstitutional feature of &sect; 2107.13; and 5) the grandson lacked standing to challenge the decedent's will by virtue of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Guernsey County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In May 1984, Clyde Daniel Wesley and his friend, Norman Leroy Edmonds, set out from Texas in Edmonds' 1977 brown Pontiac Grand Prix.  Edmonds took along his nine millimeter automatic handgun and a chrome-plated Raven .25 caliber automatic.  Wesley had a .25 caliber Armi automatic.  The two had finished their jobs as construction workers and planned to look for work in Florida.  But first, Wesley wanted to stop in Washington, Pennsylvania to see his son.  Along the way they stole a car in Oklahoma. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 13, the two arrived in Washington, Pennsylvania.  The next day, with their weapons and a supply of beer in Edmonds' car, they made a call on appellant, John David Stumpf, a friend of Wesley.  Stumpf joined them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three went to a bar in Washington where they drank six to eight beers.  Then the three began driving around, drinking from the supply of beer in the car.  Stumpf asked to see the .25 caliber Raven and Edmonds handed it to him.  They drove into Ohio.  As they drove and drank, Wesley told Edmonds (who was driving) to pass another car on the roadway.  As they did, Wesley, for sport, took a shot at the driver of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the other car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was dusk when the three stopped along I-70.  Saying they had to make a phone call, Stumpf and Wesley set out on foot for a nearby house (one hundred to one hundred fifty yards from the interstate), leaving Edmonds in the car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf and Wesley rang the back doorbell.  Mr. and Mrs. Norman Stout, who lived in the house, were seated at their kitchen table.  Mary Jane Stout was paying bills.  Norman Stout went to the door. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf and Wesley asked to use the phone and were invited in.  After he finished with the phone, Stumpf took out his handkerchief and wiped it off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf then asked Wesley, &quot;Are you ready?  Are you ready?&quot; &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not yet,&quot; Wesley answered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf asked the question several times and received the same answer.  During this time Norman Stout was cleaning his fingernails with a pocket knife.  As Mr. Stout returned the knife to his pocket, Stumpf asked once more, &quot;Are you ready?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, yes,&quot; said Wesley.  The two turned, produced pistols and Wesley announced a robbery.  Mr. Stout surrendered his billfold, which contained $ 117. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Stouts were herded down the hall to a bedroom.  There, Stumpf held the Stouts at gunpoint while Wesley ransacked&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the house.  As Wesley continued his search, Stumpf's hand began to shake, holding the gun on the Stouts.  Norman Stout decided to walk around to the end of the bed.  When he reached the end of the bed, Stumpf shot him between the eyes with the chrome-plated .25 caliber Raven automatic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stout kept going and grabbed Stumpf.  The two grappled.  Mr. Stout was pushed across the hall into another bedroom.  He suffered a bruise consistent with being struck by the butt of a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Stout does not remember being shot a second time, though a second bullet entered the top of his head.  When he regained consciousness he was lying on the floor of the across-the-hall bedroom.  He heard two male voices conversing in a normal tone.  Then he heard the four shots that killed his wife.  His next recollection was in the ambulance, on the way to the hospital.  Mary Jane Stout, while still on the bed, was shot three times in the left side of her face and once in the left wrist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf and Wesley left in Mary Jane Stout's Plymouth.  Along the highway, Stumpf threw the pistol that had been used to shoot both Stouts out the window. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Edmonds, back in his car, saw the outside floodlights come&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on at the Stout house.  The garage door opened and a car backed out.  Unbeknownst to Edmonds, it was Stumpf and Wesley in the car stolen from Mary Jane Stout.  Edmonds became frightened and drove away.  He stopped for gas in New Concord, Ohio and made a call to his family in Texas.  When he left the gas station without paying, he was chased by two men.  After stopping his car, he fired the nine millimeter pistol at them when they approached.  Edmonds then turned the car and headed back to Washington, Pennsylvania. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day after the murder, Stumpf and Wesley abandoned Mrs. Stout's car.  Before so doing, Stumpf wiped the car down because he &quot;didn't want to get involved with it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf, Wesley and Edmonds reunited in Pennsylvania.  Edmonds wanted to sell his nine millimeter pistol to obtain traveling money for a return to Texas.  Stumpf made a telephone call to arrange the sale.  Stumpf took Wesley and Edmonds to the house of John Dino who bought the nine millimeter pistol and a .357 Magnum which had been stolen from Mr. Stout.  Edmonds and Wesley then drove back to Texas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edmonds, traced by the long distance call, was arrested and told what he knew.  Stumpf, upon learning of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the warrant for his arrest, surrendered.  At first he denied being in the Stout home, but upon being told that Norman Stout had survived, he admitted robbing the Stouts, admitted shooting Mr. Stout and admitted holding the Stouts at gunpoint.  He said he left the Stout home after shooting Mr. Stout, and denied shooting Mrs. Stout.  Later he changed his story again, claiming that he and Wesley had switched weapons and that he had never fired the chrome-plated Raven.  However, Mr. Stout remembered being shot by Stumpf with the chrome-plated Raven and so testified at trial.  He also picked Stumpf out of a photo line-up that included Wesley and Edmonds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four bullets removed from Mary Jane Stout's body and the bullet from the wound to the top of Norman Stout's head were all fired from the same .25 caliber weapon.  The bullet fragment extracted from Norman Stout's forehead was too small to compare, but it did have the same width rifling marks as the other bullets that struck Norman and Mary Jane Stout.  In all, eight spent .25 caliber shell casings were recovered from the bedrooms and hallway, seven fired by the same weapon.  The other one was fired by Wesley's Armi .25 caliber pistol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Stout is left with numbness and lack of dexterity in his left arm, a loss of bowel and bladder control, and impaired ability to concentrate and remember.  His disabilities are permanent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Stumpf, was indicted for aggravated murder (with four specifications), attempted aggravated murder (with one specification), aggravated robbery (with one specification), grand theft of an automobile, and grand theft of a firearm.  Stumpf waived a trial by jury and requested a trial to a panel of three judges.  Thereafter, he pleaded guilty to: (1) count one of the indictment, aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B); (2) specification one of count one, the offense being committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, or punishment for the other offenses of aggravated robbery and attempted aggravated murder, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); (3) specification four of count one, use of a firearm while committing a felony, R.C. 2941.141; (4) the second count in the indictment, attempted aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A); and (5) the specification to the second count, use of a firearm while committing a felony, R.C. 2941.141.  The three-judge panel, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  after hearing the evidence, unanimously found Stumpf guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all the charges to which he had pleaded guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his sentencing hearing, Stumpf presented evidence in mitigation that although he dropped out of school in the tenth grade, he worked to his capacity curing the fifth and sixth grades. Also, he lacked a significant history of convictions or juvenile adjudications. Various family members and friends testified as to their opinions that he did not display violent temper, helped people, respected women, worked hard, and was not a person who displayed leadership qualities. At the time of the offense, Stumpf was twenty-three years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stumpf declined to be sworn. He made an unsworn statement on his own behalf admitting he went to the Stouts' home armed with a pistol. He claimed that Wesley was the one who used the telephone. He admitted holding the Stouts at gunpoint but said he was frightened and nervous; that Mr. Stout lunged at him and &quot;[t]he gun went off.&quot; He said Mr. Stout shoved him across the hall into another bedroom. Stumpf said that Mr. Stout, although shot in the head, was able to knock the guns from both his and Wesley's hands. Stumpf&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claimed that Wesley said &quot;shoot him&quot;; and that Stumpf looked down and saw Wesley's black Armi .25. Stumpf said &quot;I picked Dan's gun up and I fired and then at that time Mr. Stout fell on the floor.&quot; Stumpf said he went to the basement, backed the car out of the garage and was joined by Wesley. He denied shooting Mrs. Stout or being in the house when that happened. Stumpf sais he was sorry for his acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-judge panel, after hearing the evidence, issued a separate opinion in which the judges unanimously concluded that the aggravating circumstances sufficiently outweighed the mitigating factors. Thus, the panel sentenced John David Stumpf to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 7, 1985, two of the three judges overruled Stumpf's motion for leave to withdraw his guilty plea or, in the alternative, to set aside his death sentence and order that a new sentencing hearing be conducted. The third judge had died during the interim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On may 22, 1986, the court of appeals, pursuant to the mandate of R.C. 2929.05(A), reviewed the trial court proceedings, independently weighed the aggravating circumstance against the mitigating factors, and independently considered whether the death sentence was appropriate. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court of appeals affirmed Stumpf's convictions and his death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his limited testimony, Edmonds was permitted to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter and aggravated robbery, and received a sentence of seven to twenty-five years concurrent with any sentence he received in Muskingum County for the gas station shooting. Wesley was subsequently found guilty of the same charges as Stumpf. In Wesley's trial by jury, the state presented testimony by Wesley's cellmate, James Eastman, to the effect that Wesley had admitted killing Mrs. Stout himself. It is undisputed that Wesley received a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant, Carl E. Hardy, M.D., filed a malpractice action against his physicians, the appellees, Victor R. VerMeulen, M.D., and Victor R. VerMeulen, Inc. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surgical procedures, giving rise to the claim of malpractice, were performed by Dr. VerMeulen on appellant's right ear in 1973 and 1974.  The physician-patient relationship ended in 1974. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant asserts that &quot;* * * [t]he malpractice injury which is the subject matter of this action was discovered April 15, 1984.&quot; In April 1985, notice was sent by appellant in order to extend the statute of limitations by one hundred eighty days.  Appellant subsequently filed his complaint on October 1, 1985, within the one-hundred-eighty-day period. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to Civ. R. 12(C), appellees moved to dismiss on the basis that appellant's claim was barred by R.C. 2305.11(B), since appellant failed to bring his action within four years following the act or omission constituting the alleged malpractice. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The patient had no remedy for an injury to his body caused by the surgeon's negligence because his claim was extinguished before he knew of the injury or could have reasonably discovered it. The court held that Ohio Rev.

I, &sect; 16. The language in the Constitution was clear and left little room for maneuvering. The courts were to be open to those seeking remedy for injury to person, property, or reputation. The right-to-a-remedy provision did not require the analysis of rational-basis that was used to decide due process or equal protection arguments against the constitutionality of legislation. The fault in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B) was that it denied a legal remedy to one who had suffered bodily injury. The legislature lacked the power to do this even if it had acted with a rational basis by responding to a crisis in malpractice insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 14, 1984, appellant, William G. Zuern, was incarcerated at the Community Correctional Institute (&quot;CCI&quot;) in Hamilton County, Ohio.  He was the sole occupant of a cell located in a section of the institution designed for those individuals charged with serious crimes.  Some time in the latter part of May 1984, appellant had a conversation with another inmate, Wayne C. Lewis, in which he expressed a general animosity towards corrections officers for failing to give him his full five minutes of telephone time.  Lewis also had observed appellant sharpening a straightened portion of a metal bucket hook over the course of three days.  Thereafter, Lewis informed a corrections officer that appellant had a knife or a shank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCI supervisors ordered a search of several cells to recover the weapon.  On the evening of June 9, 1984, several officers were ordered to search appellant's cell, among others.  At approximately 10:20 p.m., Officers Joe Burton and Phillip Pence arrived to perform the search and found appellant lying naked in his bunk.  Officer Pence ordered appellant to get to his feet.  Appellant then stood at the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  door of the cell.  Pence unlocked the cell and told appellant to come out and put his hands against the wall.  Appellant suddenly lunged at Pence and stabbed him with the metal shank.  The instrument entered Pence's body at the lower left side of the chest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the door was secured and appellant confined, Pence lifted his shirt to observe the wound, at which time he began to feel faint.  After a nurse was summoned, Pence was rushed to a nearby hospital.  Despite efforts to save his life, Pence died.  An autopsy determined that death occurred as a result of the stab wound to the chest which penetrated Pence's heart.  Authorities immediately recovered the weapon used by appellant.  It was a long dagger-like piece of metal, approximately seven inches long.  One end was sharpened to a point, and the other was curved into a loop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted for purposely causing the death of another with prior calculation and design in violation of R.C. 2903.01.  Three specifications, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) and (6), were part of the charge: that the offense was committed while appellant was a prisoner in a detention facility as specified in R.C. 2929.04(A)(4); that the offense&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was committed while the victim was a peace officer, whom appellant knew to be such, and at the time of the commission of the offense, the victim was engaged in his duties as a peace officer as specified in R.C. 2929.04(A)(6); and that the offense alleged in this indictment was committed while the victim was a peace officer, whom appellant knew to be such, and at the time of the commission of the offense alleged herein, it was appellant's specific purpose to kill a peace officer as specified in R.C. 2929.04(A)(6). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial was had and at the conclusion of all proceedings, appellant was found guilty of aggravated murder including all three specifications.  Appellant waived the mitigation hearing which permitted the jury to consider all aggravating circumstances. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the mitigation phase, the jury recommended that the sentence of death be imposed.  The trial court, pursuant to the mandate of R.C. 2929.03(F), filed a written opinion and, having found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, imposed the sentence of death. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;In waiving his mitigation presentation, appellant made the following statement: &quot;I, William G. Zuern, after conferences with my attorneys * * * and having been fully advised of all my rights under mitigation, Section 2929.03 of the Ohio Revised Code, realizing that I could request a presentence investigation and require a mental examination and reports, and further that I could offer any testimony from witnesses and that I could either testify under oath or make a statement not under oath and not be subject to cross-examination; hereby instruct my attorneys that I do not desire to do any of the foregoing. &quot;This is my decision alone and I am making it freely and voluntarily.  It is my opinion that no testimony which I or anyone else might offer, would have any effect on the decision of this jury. &quot;I am fully aware that if I do not offer any evidence in mitigation, the jury can come to but one decision, that being death by electrocution. &quot;I have no 'death wish' and I do not wish to die; however, it is not my nature to beg or crawl.  In light of all the circumstances, I wish to maintain my self respect. &quot;I am completely satisfied with the legal services and efforts in my behalf rendered by my attorneys * * *.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In its opinion dated June 11, 1986, the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County affirmed both appellant's conviction and sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) affirming defendant's conviction for aggravated murder and his sentence of death. Defendant contended that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss a juror, and that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial because of an allegedly prejudicial statement by one of the State's witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, who was an inmate, stabbed a prison guard when a search of his cell was conducted. The prison guard later died. A fellow inmate testified that he observed defendant fashioning his dagger, that defendant had expressed a general animosity toward the prison guards, and that defendant had previously committed murder. The trial court informed the jury that the testimony in question was a &quot;gratuitous remark&quot; and it was to have been excluded from their consideration. The testimony alleging that defendant had a pending murder charge at the time of the instant offense was improper. However, the prosecution did nothing to elicit the comment in question. The untainted evidence was overwhelming and the effect of the tainted material was presumed harmless. The trial court did not error in failing to dismiss a juror after she revealed that she had overheard a news broadcast in which the prior murder charge was mentioned. Not only did defendant's counsel fail to request the juror's removal after voir dire, but also he indicated an affirmative desire that she continue on the case. That constituted an express waiver of any alleged error.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 17, 1983, Monte Tewksbury was working alone as the night clerk at a King Kwik located at 9870 Pippin Road in Hamilton County.  At about 11:00 p.m., two men entered the store in masks; one of the men carried a knife with a five-inch blade.  The men removed $ 133.97 from the cash register.  In addition, they took personal property from Tewksbury, including a Pulsar watch, a wedding ring, and his wallet which contained cash, credit cards and an automobile registration.  Tewksbury was then stabbed in the side, resulting in a puncture would to his liver that caused massive internal bleeding.  The two men ripped the inside telephone out of the wall and fled.  At approximately 11:10 p.m., Robert Shepard was driving northbound on Pippin Road.  He saw two men run from the King Kwik and enter a large red van parked at the corner of Pippin and Berthbrook.  The van then drove off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although severely injured, Tewksbury managed to get to the outside phone and call his wife.  He told her he had been robbed and hurt, and that she should call the police and an ambulance.  At that time, Cecil Conley, a customer, arrived at the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  King Kwik and saw Tewksbury leaning against a wall beside the phone.  Conley helped Tewksbury into the store and laid him on the floor.  He then went back to the phone and found Mrs. Tewksbury was still on the line.  He told her what he had found, hung up, and called the police.  Conley returned to Tewksbury, who told him about the robbery and the items that had been taken from him.  Tewksbury told Conley he was dying and that he was having trouble breathing.  He also told Conley that he had not resisted the robbery.  Mrs. Tewksbury and police officers began to arrive at the scene.  Tewksbury was transported to Providence Hospital, where he subsequently died from exsanguination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A short time later, Jim Henneberry, a clerk at a U-Totem store located at Roundtop and Colerain, was standing at the cash register.  A customer, Dennis Nitz, was playing a video game near the front door when two men wearing masks entered the store.  Henneberry realized what was occurring and he fled to a room in the rear of the store.  One of the men who carried a knife chased Henneberry.  He tried to force the door of the room to which Henneberry had fled, but was unsuccessful.  Meanwhile, the other man&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pushed Nitz back when he tried to leave.  Nitz was able to dodge him and leave the store.  As he left, he noticed that the man had red hair.  The two men left the U-Totem with the entire cash register. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robin Hannon, an occupant of an apartment located near the U-Totem, was disturbed by the noise from a loud muffler.  She looked outside and observed two people getting into a large red van parked in the U-Totem lot.  The van had a defective tail light. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 1:00 a.m. on April 18, two Forest Park police officers were on duty in a marked police cruiser.  They were eating their lunch in a K-Mart parking lot when a large red cargo van drove by at a slow rate of speed.  The van pulled into the K-Mart lot and its headlights were then turned off.  A few minutes later, the van's headlights came back on and the van left the lot traveling east on Waycross.  The officers continued to eat their lunch.  About four minutes later, the van reappeared, traveling westbound on Waycross, again at a slow rate of speed.  The police officers became suspicious and followed the van.  While following the van, one of the officers called the license plate number into the dispatcher.  It was later learned&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the van was registered to Harry's Corner, a carpet business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the officers followed the van, it pulled into the parking lot of a United Dairy Farmer store which was closed at the time.  The officers pulled behind the van.  One of the occupants, later identified as John Brewer, got out of the van and approached the police car.  Brewer identified himself as &quot;David Urey&quot; and told the police he had no identification.  Brewer first told the police that he had been working but subsequently claimed he had been out drinking and trying to pick up women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the officers asked Brewer to remain in the cruiser while he approached the van.  The driver, William Woodall, and the appellant, John Byrd, gave the officer identification which was called in to the dispatcher.  Although there were no current warrants for either Byrd or Woodall, the dispatcher reported that both had prior felony convictions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer observed the inside of the van with a flashlight and saw coins on the floor of the van.  There were also stocking masks and a knife in a tray on the dashboard.  A Shell credit card in the name of Sharon Tewksbury was lying on the floor under the passenger seat.  There was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  also what appeared to be fresh blood on the interior side of the driver's seat.  A cash drawer from a cash register was in the back of the van. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brewer, Woodall and Byrd were arrested and transported to the county patrol station.  They were eventually charged with aggravated murder and three counts of aggravated robbery.  Byrd was also charged with two death penalty specifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial began on August 1, 1983.  Following five days of trial, the jury found John Byrd guilty of aggravated murder and two counts of aggravated robbery.  One of the robbery counts had been severed for purposes of trial.  The jury also found Byrd guilty of both death penalty specifications.  The sentencing hearing was conducted on August 16, 1983.  Following presentation of evidence, the jury recommended the death penalty.  The trial court affirmed the jury's recommendation.  Defendant John Byrd appealed his conviction to the court of appeals, which subsequently affirmed the conviction and death penalty sentence. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-appellee, Shirley J. Schwarz, was employed as an Assistant Professor in the Department of History of Art of the Ohio State University (&quot;OSU&quot; or &quot;university&quot;) between the years 1976 and 1983.  Prior to this period of time, the record indicates that plaintiff taught art history as an Instructor and Assistant Professor at George Mason University for approximately three years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about June 13, 1982, plaintiff was notified by OSU that she was being denied tenure and that her employment with the university would be terminated at the end of her 1982-1983 employment contract. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, plaintiff brought this action against the following defendants in the court of common pleas: the OSU Board of Trustees in its official capacity; the individual members of the OSU Board of Trustees in their official capacities; the President of OSU in his official capacity; the Vice-President for Academic Affairs and Provost of OSU in his official capacity; the Dean of the College of the Arts in his official capacity; Professor Howard Crane, Chairman of the Department of History of Art, in his official and personal capacities; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Professor Franklin M. Ludden of the Department of History of Art, in his official and personal capacities.  Plaintiff contended, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that prior to accepting employment with OSU, she was promised that her years of service at George Mason University would be taken into consideration in reducing the seven-year probationary period that precedes the award or denial of tenure.  The university contended that such prior experience did not count in the calculation of the number of years required for tenure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within her complaint, plaintiff set forth five separate causes of action.  In count one, plaintiff alleged that defendants, in their official capacities, denied her due process of law.  In count two, plaintiff alleged that defendants, acting under color of state law, denied her due process of law in violation of Section 1983, Title 42, U.S. Code.  In count three, plaintiff alleged that defendants, acting in their official capacities, breached her employment contract with the university.  In count four, plaintiff alleged that defendant Crane, in his individual capacity, tortiously interfered with her contract rights.  Lastly, in count five, plaintiff alleged essentially&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that defendant Ludden, in his individual capacity, perpetrated a fraud against her.  In her prayer for relief, plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, specific performance, and compensatory and punitive damages.  Thereafter, answers were filed on behalf of Crane and Ludden, and a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ. R. 12(B)(1) and (6) was filed on behalf of all other defendants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon due consideration, the trial court dismissed counts one, two and three of plaintiff's complaint on the grounds that such claims are essentially against the state of Ohio and should have been brought before the Ohio Court of Claims pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2743.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the court opined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims made in the first three counts of the complaint. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The dismissal of count one of plaintiff's complaint has never been appealed.  Counts four and five of plaintiff's complaint are still pending before the court of common pleas and are not in issue in the cause </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">sub judice</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Upon appeal, the court of appeals reversed and remanded.  The appellate court found that with respect to the third count of plaintiff's complaint against the OSU Board of Trustees, there are three instances where the Court of Claims Act (R.C. Chapter 2743) does not apply.  Of particular importance to this appeal, the court noted that R.C. 2743.02(A)(1)&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exempts application of the Court of Claims Act where, by statute, the state has previously consented to suit.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal concerns the operation of a sand and gravel quarry located in Bainbridge Township, Geauga County, on land owned by appellee H &amp; R Investment Company.  In 1970, H &amp; R and Stoneridge Silica Sand &amp; Gravel Company (the original quarry operator) applied for a variance from the appellant, Bainbridge Township Board of Zoning Appeals, to permit mining in the rural area, zoned five-acre residential.  The variance was denied.  The Geauga County Court of Common Pleas reversed, finding the denial to be arbitrary and unreasonable.  The Court of Appeals for Geauga County affirmed, and directed that the variance be granted, subject to the self-imposed restrictions on the operation agreed to by Stoneridge Silica.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In re Appeal of Stoneridge Silica Sand &amp; Gravel Co. et al</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (Sept. 30, 1972), Geauga App. No. 526, unreported.  These restrictions, set out in a memorandum from Stoneridge Silica's counsel to the board of zoning appeals and dated December 7, 1970, included an agreement that the gravel excavation would be terminated after ten years from the date a permit was issued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conditional variance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was issued&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Stoneridge Silica on May 6, 1974.  The variance was to terminate no more than five years from the date of issuance, although a five-year extension was available.  However, the final conditions also provided: &quot;[i]n no case shall the excavation and extraction of natural materials and all of its ancillary functions continue after ten (10) years of the date of the issuance of the first zoning certificate for such operation.&quot; A successor-in-interest to Stoneridge Silica obtained a five-year extension of the variance in 1980, which would terminate on July 31, 1985.  In December 1980, the board of zoning appeals authorized a transfer of the variance to appellee Set Products, Inc., subject to the same limitations imposed on prior operators. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The variance granted to Stoneridge Silica has been variously termed a conditional use permit, a conditional zoning certificate, a variance, and a conditional variance by the parties and courts below.  Sand and gravel quarrying is not a use which is expressly provided for in the Bainbridge Township Zoning Resolution.  See Section 510.12 (as amended to January 1, 1977).  Rather, the board of zoning appeals was authorizing a variance from Section 510 (&quot;Residence Districts&quot;), to which it attached several conditions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> a conditional variance.  Variances and conditional zoning certificates are distinct concepts, entailing wholly separate considerations and standards, pursuant to R.C. 519.14, and must be kept discrete.

On March 15, 1984, the zoning board granted the transfer, but denied the extension on the basis of the ten-year limitation on the variance, concluding essentially that Best Silica had failed to show either unnecessary hardship or that denial of the variance would constitute an unconstitutional taking.  This decision was not appealed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 19, 1984, application No. 84-13C was filed by Best Silica Co., Set Products, Inc., and H &amp; R Investment Co.  They sought a variance to operate the quarry for its entire useful life, allowing for extraction of the remaining eighty percent of materials left to be mined and providing for reclamation of the land in accordance with a plan filed with the Ohio Division of Reclamation, pursuant to R.C. 1514.02.  Following a hearing on May 17, 1984, the zoning board denied the application, finding it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> due to the decision on application No. 84-6C.  The board also ruled that, notwithstanding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">res judicata,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there was insufficient showing of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unnecessary hardship to grant the variance.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed, finding sufficient differences in the two applications to defeat the application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">res judicata</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.

The appellate court reversed. The court reversed the appellate court's decision, holding that (1) it was error to exercise the 10-year mining limitation from the variance; (2) the unnecessary hardship issue was res judicata because it was not appealed; (3) the new quarry owner's second application did not present sufficient evidence of changed circumstances or substantive application changes to overcome the first denial; and (4) the state's issuance of a permit did not preempt the conditions of the variance because local approval must also be received.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 19, 1982, the lifeless body of nineteen-year-old Karen Range was discovered by her mother in the bathroom of their residence in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Karen's throat had been repeatedly slashed, her face and head were severely bruised and battered, and her clothes ripped open to expose her breasts and pubic region.  Quantities of semen were found both in and around the vagina.  Three separate bloody shoeprints were present on Karen's chest, one of which had been applied with sufficient force to cause a bruise.  The cause of death was later determined to be exsanguination, or bleeding to death, as a result of the severing of the major blood vessels in the neck.  The record discloses the following account of the events leading up to this tragic conclusion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the afternoon of Karen's death, appellant, David J. Steffen, then twenty-two years of age, was working as a door-to-door salesman of a household cleaning product called Hy-Pro.  He approached the suburban residence of Karen's parents, with whom Karen was then living.  Karen was in the front yard.  Appellant demonstrated the product to her on several spots on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the front landing and on the doorbell.  According to appellant's testimony, Karen then allowed him to enter the house.  Appellant made further demonstrations of the product in the living room and then he and Karen proceeded to the bathroom.  The events that transpired in that room were described by appellant in his confession as follows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Karen observing, appellant sprayed some Hy-Pro on the rear base of the toilet.  As he and Karen both straightened up to a standing position, he brushed against Karen's breast.  She began screaming.  In an attempt to silence her, appellant stuffed his cleaning rag into her mouth and began hitting her repeatedly.  Karen continued to scream.  Appellant grabbed her, ripping her blouse off, and knocked her to the floor.  He then got a paring knife from the kitchen and cut her throat three times.  According to appellant's confession, he tried raping her, but could not achieve an erection.  The record indicates that in rage and frustration, he stomped on her chest.  Grabbing the Hy-Pro bottle, appellant ran out of the house.  He discarded his bloody shirt by some bushes (it was never found) and concealed the Hy-Pro supplies (later recovered).  Realizing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that his employer would expect an explanation for his absence, appellant concocted a tale about being robbed.  He called the police with this story and made out a police report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, appellant was picked up for questioning by Cincinnati police regarding his robbery report and the murder.  Appellant initially denied any involvement.  He then asserted that he had been present during the murder, but that his adopted brother had been the actual perpetrator.  Eventually, appellant confessed to police that he alone had killed Karen but denied the rape. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was subsequently indicted for aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01, with specifications that the offense was committed while appellant was committing or attempting to commit the offenses of aggravated burglary and rape.  Appellant was also charged with rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02 and with aggravated burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.11.  Appellant entered a plea of not guilty on all counts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial commenced on April 25, 1983.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges: aggravated murder, both aggravating circumstances, rape and aggravated burglary.  The subsequent sentencing hearing resulted&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in a recommendation by the jury that appellant be sentenced to death, upon their determination that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.  The trial court, upon completing its own duty to weigh the mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances, adopted the jury's recommendation and imposed a penalty of death.  In addition, appellant received consecutive sentences of seven to twenty-five years for rape and seven to twenty-five years for aggravated burglary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed appellant's convictions and sentence in all respects. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted for murder, rape, and aggravated burglary. The trial court, after weighing mitigating factors and aggravating circumstances, imposed the penalty of death. The court of appeals affirmed. Defendant appealed as of right alleging numerous points of error. Specifically, defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that one who lawfully entered premises became a trespasser subject to conviction for burglary by virtue of the commission of the felony on the premises. The court held that under the circumstances of the case, even assuming lawful initial entry, the jury was justified in inferring from the evidence that defendant's privilege to remain in the home terminated the moment he commenced the assault. Defendant also argued that the death penalty was disproportionately severe compared to penalties imposed in similar cases in the county. The court held that the proportionality review was satisfied by a review of those cases already decided by the reviewing court in which the death penalty had been imposed, but not those cases in which the death penalty could have been sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Chapter 34 of the Cincinnati Municipal Code (&quot;CMC&quot;), the city council of defendant-appellant city of Cincinnati is empowered to create &quot;environmental quality districts&quot; (&quot;EQD's&quot;) to &quot;* * * assist the development of land and structures to be compatible with the environment and to protect the quality of the urban environment in those locations where the characteristics of the environment are of significant public value and are vulnerable to damage by development permitted under conventional zoning and building regulations.&quot; CMC Section 3400.2.  Such additional zoning regulation in this context is more commonly known as &quot;overlay&quot; zoning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record indicates that during 1975, the defendant-appellant Clifton Town Meeting (a neighborhood group) successfully opposed the development of a &quot;Burger Chef&quot; restaurant on Ludlow Avenue in the city of Cincinnati on the basis that such a restaurant would have a destabilizing effect on the Ludlow Avenue business district. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 27, 1978, Cincinnati City Council adopted Ordinance No. 398-1978 which created an environmental quality-urban design zone district (&quot;EQ-UD&quot;) over&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the existing zone district in the vicinity of Clifton and Ludlow Avenues in the city of Cincinnati.  Incorporated within this ordinance was a Development Guidelines Report (&quot;DGR&quot;) which provided in guideline III A 2: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New businesses should contribute to the desired mix of commercial activities</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; franchise type establishments are acceptable provided that they are primarily pedestrian and not automobile oriented.&quot; (Emphasis added.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1982, plaintiff-appellee Alvin Lipson purchased a theatre located at 320 Ludlow Avenue within the subject EQ-UD.  In 1984, the theatre was leased to plaintiff-appellee Franchise Developers, Inc. (&quot;FDI&quot;).  Early in 1984, FDI applied for a building permit to remodel the theatre for use as a &quot;Wendy's&quot; restaurant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the building permit application process, defendant-appellant James R. Krusling, Director of Buildings and Inspections for the city of Cincinnati, served as hearing examiner and conducted a hearing with respect to FDI's application.  As a result of the hearing, Krusling recommended approval of the application over the strong objections raised by Clifton Town Meeting.  Subsequently, Clifton Town Meeting appealed Krusling's decision&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to Cincinnati City Council pursuant to CMC Section 3405.3. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing was held by city council with respect to FDI's application, whereupon council reversed Krusling's decision and directed that the permit application be denied.  In so doing, the council adopted separate findings of fact and conclusions of law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Some of the conclusions of law adopted by Cincinnati City Council were the following: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;1.  The proposed fast food restaurant at 320 Ludlow Avenue would be a valid use of the property under the B-2 Community Business District Regulations, Chapter 21, of the Zoning Code.  Pursuant to the provisions of &sect; 102.5 of the Zoning Code, such property may, however, be subject to additional regulations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;2.  The subject address is part of an Environmental Quality District, created by Ordinance 398-1978 of the Council of the City of Cincinnati, and thus subject to the provisions of Chapter 34 of the Zoning Code, the provisions of which, pursuant to &sect; 3401.1, prevail over any conflict with the B-2 underlying zone regulations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;3.  There is a substantial City interest in protecting the stability of neighborhoods and neighborhood business districts, and Ordinance No. 398-1978 is a valid exercise of the legislative authority of the Council of the City of Cincinnati. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;4.  The Council may validly provide for land use regulations in ordinances establishing Environmental Quality District Regulations, pursuant to the provisions of Zoning Code &sect; 3400.2. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;5.  The phrase 'fast food restaurant' is not defined in any provision of the Zoning Code.  It must be defined in accordance with the ordinary and usual meaning of the phrase, as well as by the usage given such phrase by the public and the industry involved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;6.  The provision of the Clifton Community Plan (as approved by the Planning Commission and adopted as part of the Coordinated City Plan) to the effect that fast food restaurants are not appropriate along Ludlow Avenue is a valid expression of the mutual desire of the Clifton neighborhood and the City of Cincinnati. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c16"><SPAN CLASS="c14">&quot;7.  Inasmuch as the proposed use fails to contribute to the desired mix of commercial activity on Ludlow Avenue, for the reason set forth above, it fails to comply with the provisions of Ordinance No. 398-1978, and is not a permitted use under the Zoning Code of the City of Cincinnati.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The matter was then appealed by FDI and Lipson to the court of common pleas, where they sought a declaratory judgment against the city, Krusling and Clifton Town Meeting that Ordinance No. 398-1978 and its incorporated DGR are unconstitutional.  Upon motions for summary judgment filed by all the parties, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, thereby affirming the decision of city council to deny the permit application. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon further appeal, the court of appeals reversed and reinstated the decision of the hearing examiner that granted the permit application.  The appellate court narrowed the issue to whether DGR III A 2 is a constitutionally acceptable expression of governmental judgment upon which city council was entitled to rely, when it addressed the merits of FDI's application in light of the overlay zoning regulations contained in CMC Chapter 34.  The court of appeals opined that the regulation of land use apart from the underlying provisions of the zoning code is clearly prohibited, and that any regulatory action taken in connection with the creation of an environmental quality district is confined to only the physical or aesthetic aspects of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  property development.  The appellate court held that DGR III A 2, standing alone, cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny due to the inherent vagueness of its terms. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The lower trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee corporation but the lower appellate court reversed the decision. The lower appellate court first reviewed the constitutionality of the municipal zoning provision and found it too vague. The court disagreed because it found the lower appellate court did not give it the presumption of validity that it deserved. The court found the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because such an argument is inherently deficient in a zoning case. The court also found the lower appellate court erred in finding that land use regulations were clearly prohibited in the instant overlay zoning scheme because the court found the overlay zoning scheme presented constituted a proper exercise of the city's zoning authority in its attempt to preserve and protect the character of certain neighborhoods that the city deems important, in order to promote the overall quality of life within the city's boundaries. The court therefore reversed the lower appellate court decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 12, 1984, Roger M. Stiller, Superintendent of the Columbiana Exempted Village School District, filed two complaints charging defendant-appellants, Richard and Pamela Schmidt, with failing to send their daughter, Sara, a minor of compulsory school age, to a school or special education program conforming to the minimum standards established by the State Board of Education, in violation of R.C. 3321.04 and 3321.38(A).  Each complaint contained twenty counts, alleging that appellants failed to send Sara to a school on twenty successive school days between September 17 and October 12, 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard and Pamela Schmidt are &quot;born-again Christians,&quot; and believe that it is their undelegable duty as parents to educate Sara themselves.  Appellants undertook to teach Sara at home with assistance from a correspondence curriculum they obtained from Winchester Christian Academy, a private, non-chartered school located in Columbus.  Appellants enrolled Sara as a student at Winchester Christian Academy, but she has never attended classes there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon becoming aware that Sara was of compulsory school age but was not attending&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a school, Superintendent Stiller informed appellants that they were required by Ohio law to obtain his approval for their home education program.  Appellants did not seek Stiller's approval because they felt that their religious beliefs not only required them to educate Sara themselves, but also forbade them from seeking Stiller's permission to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter came to trial on February 28, 1985, before the Columbiana County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, and on April 8, 1985. the court entered judgment finding both appellants guilty as charged.  the court of appeals affirmed. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants were the parents of a minor child. For religious reasons, the parents home schooled the child and refused to request permission for home schooling from the superintendent. The superintendent brought charges. The trial court convicted defendants, and they appealed. The appellate court affirmed, and defendants appealed. The court affirmed. The approval requirement of &sect; 3321.04(A)(2) had not violated defendants' rights under the First Amendment because although defendants' religious beliefs appeared sincere, defendants had failed to demonstrate that the approval requirement infringed upon their right to the free exercise of religion. Without the application by defendants and without a proposal to the superintendent, there was no way to balance defendants' rights against the State's interest. The delegation of authority to the superintendent was not improper because the superintendent was given an intelligible principle for guidance and desirable flexibility to accommodate home education programs in &sect; 3321.04(A)(2), and any arbitrary and capricious refusal was subject to appeal. Finally, the approval requirement of &sect; 3321.04(A)(2) was not vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1973, the city of South Euclid, Ohio has passed several ordinances for the purpose of regulating the sick-leave benefits of the police and fire fighters employed by the municipality.

The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling, concluding that neither its order of November 7, 1983 nor the trial court's order of May 4, 1984 did anything other than to declare Ordinance No. 49-80 invalid, and thus there was no order that the city could have violated. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

Consequently, the court held that in a declaratory judgment action contesting the constitutionality of an ordinance, an entry granting judgment to the plaintiffs without expressly directing the defendants to do, or refrain from doing, a particular thing or things, could not be the basis of finding the defendants in contempt upon the enactment of subsequent legislation, allegedly containing the same or similar infirmities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The issue presented in the common pleas court was whether the city was preempted by operation of state law from regulating, pursuant to the authority of local zoning ordinances, the retail sale of alcoholic beverages within the city.

Because, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4303.292(A)(2)(a), a liquor permit could not validly be issued, under state law, in contravention of local zoning ordinances, municipal zoning ordinances limiting the retail sales of alcoholic beverages within the municipal corporate boundaries were not in conflict with state liquor laws providing for the issuance of liquor permits.

His conviction and sentence were upheld throughout state appeals. The United States Supreme Court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded for further consideration. The court reaffirmed. The court found that defendant's case was distinguished from Caldwell v. Mississippi because Ohio had no sentencing jury and the power to impose the death penalty resided in the trial court under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.03(D)(3). The prosecutor's comments in defendant's case were not improper because they accurately stated that the jury only recommended whether or not to impose the death penalty. The court noted that the appellate courts in Ohio were required to weigh the mitigating factors against aggravated circumstances to evaluate whether the imposition of the death penalty was appropriate under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.05. Therefore, they made an original determination. Defense counsel had made brash and inappropriate references to the death penalty and had argued the merits. The State had merely made a measured response that accurately reflected the law. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Glenn, appellant, was convicted of the aggravated murder of Mahoning County Reserve Deputy Sheriff John Litch, Jr.  Litch was killed while transporting a prisoner, Robert Glenn, who was also appellant's half-brother, from the prison to a hospital for treatment of Robert's leg which was in a cast.  While en route, the deputy's squad car was stopped at a downtown traffic light.  At that time, appellant's vehicle struck him from behind.  The deputy left the squad car and walked toward the other vehicle.  As he approached the door, he was shot at close range and killed with a twelve-gauge shotgun.  The prisoner then left the squad car and entered the other vehicle.  Both men immediately departed in the auto driven by appellant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crime was committed in downtown Youngstown, Ohio, and was witnessed by two firemen.  It was shown at trial that appellant had access to the information concerning the scheduled medical treatment of his half-brother.  Appellant's girlfriend testified that appellant admitted to her that he killed the officer.  Also, appellant had been observed earlier in the day driving the vehicle used in the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  escape. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted for escape and aggravated murder with a specification, pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(6), that the victim was a peace officer.  The jury found appellant guilty, after which the jury was released until the beginning of the sentencing phase of the trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the sentencing phase presentations, the jury recommended the death penalty.  The trial court then determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.  It thereafter adopted the jury's recommendation and sentenced appellant to death.  The court of appeals, after independently reweighing all the evidence, mitigating factors, and aggravating circumstances, as well as determining appellant's other assignments of error, affirmed both the verdict and the sentence. </SPAN></P>

On further review by the court, the court concluded that the victim was acting as a peace officer under &sect; 2929.04(A)(6). There was no error in allowing witness testimony regarding defendant's prior incarcerations because there was no evidence that the information was given with a motive to harm defendant's case. There was substantial, probative evidence from which the jury could decide beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty. Witnesses observed defendant driving the vehicle used in the incident, and there were also witnesses at the scene of the crime. Moreover, the prisoner's overalls were found in defendant's car.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-appellant, New Energy Company of Indiana, manufactures ethanol and is engaged in commerce among the states. Ethanol is a 199 proof alcohol which is mixed with gasoline in a 10/90 ratio to form a blend called gasohol. Plaintiff's manufacturing facility is located in South Bend, Indiana. Ethanol produced by New Energy has been marketed in Ohio at a rate of approximately one million gallons per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective January 1, 1985 the Ohio General Assembly amended R.C. 5735.145(B) to provide that any fuel otherwise eligible for a tax credit shall not contain ethanol produced outside Ohio unless the state of origin provides a similar tax credit, exemption or refund for similar fuel containing ethanol produced in Ohio. Indiana does not provide any such credit, exemption or refund for Ohio-produced ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff brought this action to challenge the constitutionality of R.C. 5735.145(B), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiff contended, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that the statute violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution by placing an undue burden&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on interstate commerce. Plaintiff alleged that the statute effectively barred it from marketing its ethanol in Ohio, since the unavailability of a tax credit for plaintiff's ethanol renders the product economically undesirable to Ohio dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held that R.C. 5735.145(B) is constitutional, finding no significant burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed. In holding that the statute does not violate the Commerce Clause, the court reasoned that it has neither a discriminatory purpose nor a discriminatory effect. It gives no benefit to Ohio ethanol producers that is not equally available to an out-of-state producer as long as that state provides incentives to all ethanol producers, including Ohio, on an equal basis. The court stressed that the statute effectuates the legitimate state purpose of encouraging the production of an environmentally benigh fuel additive as a replacement for lead, a notorious pollutant. The statute does not constitute an outright ban on plaintiff's ethanol in Ohio, nor does it preclude plaintiff from doing business in Ohio. It gives no direct competitive advantage to Ohio producers. It does not tax the use or sale of ethanol&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[*3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  differently depending on whether it was produced in our out of Ohio. In sum, the statute does not impermissibly impose an oppressive burden on the industry and business of other states in order to enhance the vitality of domestic commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The manufacturer, which was located in Indiana, produced and sold ethanol. It challenged &sect; 5735.145(B), which limited the tax credit eligibility for fuel containing ethanol produced outside of Ohio. The trial court determined that &sect; 5735.145(B) did not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. After the decision was affirmed, the manufacturer sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the manufacturer had standing to challenge the statute, despite the fact that it did not pay taxes in Ohio. The manufacturer was asserting its right to engage in interstate commerce. Moreover, the statute had an adverse competitive impact on its business. The court held that &sect; 5735.145(B) was unconstitutional. The statute presented local business with a direct commercial advantage. The statute made it impossible for the manufacturer to makes sales in Ohio. Ohio's interest in encouraging the use of ethanol was outweighed by the burden that the statute imposed on interstate commerce. In addition, the essential attribute of even-handed treatment was not present in &sect; 5735.145(B).

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, State Personnel Board of Review, hereinafter &quot;board,&quot; had received separate requests to investigate the civil service commissions of the cities of Bay Village, Cleveland and Lyndhurst because of alleged failures to comply with the duties imposed by law upon them.  When the cities responded to the board's inquiry into these allegations by contending that the board had no jurisdiction to investigate the action of charter municipalities' civil service commissions, the board filed this declaratory judgment action.  The trial court found that the board lacked authority to investigate the civil service commissions of these charter municipalities or to investigate the Bay Village Civil Service Commission with respect to city school district employees.  The court of appeals affirmed on the basis that the establishment and regulation of municipal civil service commissions are purely matters of local self-government as to which charter provisions prevail over conflicting state statutes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The court found that the municipalities' charter provisions regulating the procedures for selection and removal of their civil service commissioners, were sufficiently confined to the internal affairs of these municipalities as to be immune from conflicting state regulations under the Home Rule Amendment. Moreover, the court held that the General Assembly had the authority to enact such laws, applicable to the cities, only where and to the extent that such laws would not restrict the exercise by such cities of their powers of local self-government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Review was granted by the court upon the certification of conflicts between the courts of appeals. Plaintiff minors commenced malpractice actions against defendant health care providers. The Court of Appeals for Lucas County (Ohio) held that the applicable statute of limitations, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(B), was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County reached a contrary conclusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Under &sect; 2305.11(B), a medical malpractice claim had to be brought within one year from the date that the cause of action accrued, or within four years from the date of the alleged malpractice. Furthermore, only the claims of minors under the age of 10 were tolled and then only until they reached the age of 14, at which time they had to file their action. That court held that &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional with regard to minors. Under Ohio law, a legislative enactment was valid for purposes of due process if it bore a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public and was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Moreover, the scope of due process included access to the courts for all injured persons. Given that minors lacked standing to sue prior to the age of majority, &sect; 2305.11(B) effectively prevented such access. The mere fact that a parent was permitted to sue in behalf of a minor child was not sufficient. In that regard, the court noted that it was unrealistic to expect that children would willingly seek redress against their parents for their failure to timely commence malpractice actions in their behalf.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Lucas County. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County was reversed.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 1, 1984, appellees, Nannie O. Moss and George W. Kelley, obtained a judgment against Lewis Ulmer, Sr., d.b.a. Lou Ulmer Realty, and Helen Ulmer, his wife (hereinafter &quot;Ulmer&quot;).  The judgment was in the amount of $ 3,105.40 in compensatory damages and $ 10,000 in punitive damages.  Appellees were unable to collect this judgment from Ulmer, and therefore, on August 1, 1984, they filed application for an order directing payment out of the Ohio Real Estate Recovery Special Account (hereinafter &quot;special account&quot;) in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County pursuant to R.C. 4735.12. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties reached a compromise settlement regarding the compensatory damages portion of appellees' judgment and, on December 10, 1984, the trial court journalized two entries, one of which ordered appellant, Charles Santer, Superintendent of the Ohio Division of Real Estate, to pay appellees the sum of $ 2,505.40, plus interest from the special account, which represented the balance of compensatory damages due.  The other entry ordered the superintendent to pay appellees the sum of $ 10,000, plus interest, from the special account&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which represented the punitive damages portion of the judgment against Ulmer. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, appellants argued that the trial court acted improperly in allowing the clients to recover punitive damages from the special account. Ohio Rev.

This amendment occurred after the clients filed their action, but before they attempted to collect on the judgment from the agent. The clients asserted that applying the amendment to bar the payment of punitive damages would have constituted an unconstitutionally retroactive application of the law in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court held that the amendment applied to the action, precluding the payment of the punitive damages award from the special account. The claim against the special account did not arise when the action was filed, but after the first judgment was obtained and the clients' efforts at collection of that judgment were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Ohio's statute prohibiting pandering sexually oriented material involving a minor, R.C. 2907.322, which became effective on September 27, 1984, provides as follows: &quot;(A) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">No person, with knowledge of the character of the material or performance involved, shall do any of the following:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> &quot;(1) Create, reproduce, or publish any material that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality; &quot;(2) Exhibit or advertise for sale or dissemination, sell, disseminate, or display any material that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality; &quot;(3) Create, direct, or produce a performance that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality; &quot;(4) Advertise for presentation, present, or participate in presenting a performance that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality; &quot;(5) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">Possess or control any material that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14"> &quot;(6) Bring or cause to be brought into this state any material that shows a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality. &quot;(B) This section does not apply to any material or performance that is sold, disseminated, displayed, possessed, controlled, brought or caused to be brought into this state, or presented for a bona fide medical, scientific, educational, religious, governmental, judicial, or other proper purpose, by or to a physician, psychologist, sociologist, scientist, teacher, person pursuing bona fide studies or research, librarian, clergyman, prosecutor, judge, or other person having a proper interest in the material or performance. &quot;(C) Whoever violates this section is guilty of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor.  Violation of division (A)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (6) of this section is a felony of the second degree.  Violation of division (A)(5) of this section is a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of division (A)(5) of this section, pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor is a felony of the fourth degree.&quot; (Emphasis added to challenged provisions.)</SPAN></P>

The state appealed, and the court reversed the judgment. On appeal, the court held that the state had a legitimate interest in attempting to ban such materials, and that the value of permitting possession of photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct was exceedingly modest, if not de minimis. The court concluded that the competing public policy and constitutional concerns tilted decidedly in favor of sustaining the statute. Finally, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2907.322(A)(5), which prohibited the knowing possession or control of material which showed a minor participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality, did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arises from a complaint filed by the city of Kettering on April 23, 1984, seeking a declaratory judgment that R.C. 4117.01(F)(2) is unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1970, Kettering adopted Resolution No. 2017-70, setting forth its collective bargaining policy regarding municipal employees.  That resolution, later codified as Ordinance No. 3106-84, excluded from collective bargaining units all supervisory employees or those who formulate personnel policy.  Pursuant to the resolution the city has, since 1970, declined to recognize or bargain with any employee organization representing police sergeants, lieutenants or captains. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 1, 1984 Ohio's new Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act, R.C. 4117.01 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became effective.  As pertinent to this appeal, R.C. 4117.01(C)(10) excludes supervisors from the Act's coverage.  However, R.C. 4117.01(F)(2) specifically provides as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With respect to members of a police or fire department, no person shall be deemed a supervisor except the chief of the department or those individuals who, in the absence of the chief, are authorized to exercise the authority&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and perform the duties of the chief of the department * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on April 1, 1984, Teamsters Local No. 740 filed a petition with the State Employment Relations Board pursuant to R.C. 4117.07 seeking certification as the exclusive bargaining representative of Kettering's police sergeants, lieutenants and captains.  Shortly thereafter, Kettering filed its complaint requesting the declaratory judgment and seeking an injunction to prevent recognition of and collective bargaining with representatives of its police command officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties filed motions for summary judgment in October 1984.  The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the basis that the General Assembly's exercise of its police power on a matter of statewide concern in enacting R.C. Chapter 4117 prevailed over the city's ordinance.  This determination was affirmed by the court of appeals. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The city contended that the management of its police department was a power of local self-government with which the state could not interfere pursuant to Ohio Const. art.

Code Ann. &sect; 4117.01 et seq., in the name of municipal home rule powers. The city's position was rejected by the court who concluded that the city failed to overcome the presumption of the Act's constitutionality because the city failed to demonstrate that requiring it to bargain collectively with its police command officers would work an unconstitutional interference with its local self-government power to manage its police department. Further, the state general assembly, after experiencing public employee labor strife with one city, properly exercised its constitutional police power to promote the general safety and welfare in enacting the measure, to which the city's police powers were subordinated.</SPAN></P>

No. 100 were unconstitutionally retroactive in violation of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the enactment of Am. Sub. H.B. No. 100, East Ohio Gas was operating under an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio dated August 4, 1982 authorizing a 12.57 percent rate of return.  East Ohio Gas was also subject to the statutory annual excise tax on gross receipts imposed upon public utilities pursuant to R.C. 5727.38.  At the time the rate order became final, the excise tax rate was 3.85 percent.  R.C. 4909.161, which provided that the payment of an increased tax levy could be recovered in the utility's rates, was also effective. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Am. Sub. H.B. No. 100 became effective February 24, 1983.  (140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1855.) Section 6 of that bill increased the annual excise tax rate to 4.35 percent for the 1983 tax year which, for natural gas companies, encompassed the period from May 1, 1982 to April 30, 1983. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 29 of the bill further&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provided that notwithstanding R.C. 4909.161, payment of the increased excise tax could not be recovered by a public utility. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Section 6 of Am. Sub. H.B. No. 100 provides in pertinent part: &quot;Notwithstanding section 5727.38 of the Revised Code, the rate of tax to be charged on the annual excise tax statements required to be filed on or before the first day of August of 1983, shall be four and thirty-five hundredths per cent of the gross receipts.  The amount of tax shall not be less than ten dollars in any case.&quot; (140 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 1925.) </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;Section 29 of Am. Sub. H.B. No. 100 provides as follows: &quot;Notwithstanding section 4909.161 of the Revised Code, the increased excise tax levy imposed by the amendments made by Section 6 of this act shall not be recoverable by a public utility in its rates.&quot; (140 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 1936.)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East Ohio Gas contended that as a result of the enactment of the bill, its tax liability for the 1983 tax year was increased by nearly $ 6.5 million which could not be recovered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in its rates but rather was exacted from the utility's owners, thus reducing its rate of return. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court found in favor of the company, ordered the appellees, Tax Commissioner et al., to make refund to the company and entered judgment as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1.  Insofar as it increased the rate of the tax imposed upon plaintiff's taxable gross receipts actually received prior to February 24, 1983, Section 6 of House Bill </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[sic]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 100 is unconstitutional as a retroactive law in violation of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;2.  Insofar as it suspends the operation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ohio Rev. Code</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &sect; 4909.161 as applied to the plaintiff for its 1983 excise tax liability, Section 29 of House Bill </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[sic]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No. 100 is void as a retroactive law in violation of Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals reversed.  It held that Section 6 of the bill was not unconstitutionally retroactive because the twelve-month period for ascertaining gross receipts had not closed at the time the tax increase became effective.  The appellate court also reasoned that Section 29 did not retroactively suspend operation of R.C. 4909.161 because the section affected&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  only payments of an increased levy made after the effective date of the bill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of appellant's motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant gas company sought review of an order from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio), which, in an action for declaratory to declare that Am. Sub. H.B. 100, &sect; 6, 29 (Ohio 1983) were unconstitutionally retroactive in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, reversed the trial court and held that &sect; 6 was not unconstitutionally retroactive and that &sect; 29 did not retroactively suspend operation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4904.161.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The gas company claimed that in calculating its expenses as part of the ratemaking process, it reasonably relied to its detriment on the assurance contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4909.161 that it could recover any increased tax liability. The gas company contended that pursuant to Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, the general assembly was estopped from retroactively altering the law upon which the company relied at the time its rate of return was fixed. On appeal the court held that where an excise tax on the privilege of doing business was measured by the gross receipts from the operation of a business for an annual period, the tax rate could constitutionally be increased at a time prior to the end of that annual period. The court noted that the gas company's excise tax liability was calculable and payable only after its tax year had concluded. It was not until an accounting year was closed that a taxpayer was closed that a taxpayer was entitled to consider that its income or gross receipts was finally its own.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 6, 1983, Vinnie M. Prince, owner and operator of the V &amp; E Delicatessen at East 86 Street and Quincy Avenue in Cleveland, was shot and killed during an attempted armed robbery of her establishment.  An autopsy later revealed that the victim died from a gunshot wound of the chest.  Octavia Hickman, a nearby resident, testified that while walking back to her home after shopping at the Sav-more Market, she noticed a greenish-blue Cadillac without a rear license plate pull up across from her house.  She observed two black males inside the car; one behind the wheel and the other in the back seat.  She later observed another black male come over a nearby fence and dive through the open window of the Cadillac.  The car then drove away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness near the delicatessen when the incident occurred was Clifford Roberson.  Roberson was heading toward the store with a female companion when a shot was heard from inside the store.  He immediately grabbed his friend and pushed her up against the wall of the building, in an apparent effort to protect her.  When he heard a screen door slam, he turned around and saw two black males&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  running from the store.  Roberson testified that the taller man was about five feet eleven inches tall wearing &quot;some type of rag around his head&quot; and was holding a long-barreled pistol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon opening the store's door, Roberson observed Prince lying &quot;almost to the door as if she was trying to chase them or something.&quot; Roberson proceeded to flag down a nearby police car and informed the officers therein of the situation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness to this incident, Solomon Smith, testified he saw &quot;two men run across the street, and run down to the corner of Mr. Cooper's house, and turn through the alley, and jump the fence.&quot; He described these assailants as two black males, one 5'10 1/2&quot; tall, the other &quot;a little shorter.&quot; Smith did not observe anything in either of the suspects' hands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime after this incident, Detective Robert Moore received a telephone call from Ricky Tramble and a meeting between them was arranged.  As a result, Moore began looking for the Cadillac used in the crime, and several suspects.  Tramble testified at trial that he informed the detective that on the day Vinnie Prince was killed, he was with Edward O'Neal, Michael Streeter, Danny Jones and appellant, Jay D. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Scott, at O'Neal's girlfriend's house &quot;[t]o get high.&quot; Tramble stated that he had overheard appellant say, &quot;Well, I did what I had to do.  She shouldn't have made me move like that.  Fuck it.  It's over with.&quot; Later that day, appellant told Tramble, &quot;[t]hese niggers don't know what they're doing.  * * * [T]hey get to crying about this and crying about that.  This is what I do.&quot; Appellant professed to be &quot;a stick-up man.&quot; Tramble related that O'Neal had informed him the next day of their involvement in the V &amp; E Delicatessen incident, including the shooting of Prince. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to this information, Danny Jones was subsequently apprehended and arrested.  Jones' automobile, an older model, blue, turquoise bottom Cadillac with a white top and no license plate, but with a thirty-day tag, was also confiscated at this time.  Jones signed a typewritten statement wherein he related to the police that he and Edward O'Neal, Michael Streeter, and Jay D. Scott were driving around looking for a place to rob.  After selecting the V &amp; E Delicatessen as a target, appellant requested &quot;front money&quot; in order to fabricate a purchase and wanted someone to go into the store with him.  O'Neal finally&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  agreed to accompany appellant into the store.  At this time appellant was observed armed with a .38 caliber pistol that looked like a police revolver and O'Neal was armed with a .25 caliber automatic handgun.  Jones then pulled his car around the corner.  O'Neal and Scott got out of the car and Jones and Streeter waited for them there.  Later, appellant and O'Neal came running through a yard and climbed over a fence.  O'Neal ran to the car and got in and appellant dove into the car through a window.  Jones was told to &quot;pull off.&quot; Later, Jones asked O'Neal what had happened and was told &quot;that J.D. shot her * * * cause she went for her shit (her gun).&quot; When Jones asked appellant if he had killed her, appellant replied, &quot;naw she was still standing up when he ran out the door.&quot; At trial, Jones repudiated that part of his typewritten statement wherein he acknowledged their intent to rob the V &amp; E Delicatessen.  Instead, Jones contended that appellant and O'Neal had gone into the store to get cold beer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police subsequently apprehended Edward O'Neal who also gave a typewritten statement to the police.  Therein, O'Neal stated that he, Danny Jones, Michael Streeter, and appellant were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  driving around in Jones' Cadillac.  They stopped in front of the V &amp; E Delicatessen because appellant told them that he wanted to get some bologna and crackers.  O'Neal followed appellant into the store.  Appellant asked for bologna and crackers and when the old woman minding the store prepared them, appellant pulled out a pistol.  Appellant told the woman to &quot;freeze&quot; and when the woman began to &quot;holler&quot; and &quot;yell&quot; appellant fired a single shot at the decedent, striking her.  O'Neal related that he was momentarily stunned by this occurrence and it wasn't until appellant grabbed him and pulled him out of the store that he began to run.  They jumped a fence and ran to the car.  O'Neal stated that he did not observe the victim reach for a weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, O'Neal's testimony differed from this statement in that it was he who ordered the bologna and crackers at the store.  In addition, O'Neal asserted that he was unarmed throughout this ordeal and that Michael Streeter had the .25 caliber weapon in his possession while waiting in the car.  Lastly, O'Neal confirmed that he had talked with Ricky Tramble about what had transpired at the V &amp; E Delicatessen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbara Campbell, a trace-evidence&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  analyst with the Cuyahoga County Coroner's office, testified that pursuant to the Walker Nitrate Test, the muzzle of the gun which killed Vinnie Prince was estimated to have been twelve inches from her body when it was fired.  She further testified that a trace metal test conducted on the victim's hands indicated that she did not handle or fire a weapon prior to her death.  However, Detective David Hicks testified that Prince had a fully loaded .38 caliber revolver on her person when she was found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 17, 1983, the grand jury charged appellant with aggravated murder with an aggravated robbery specification and a firearm specification and aggravated robbery.  Also charged in the same indictments were co-defendants Danny Jones, Edward O'Neal and Michael Streeter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 10, 1983, appellant was apprehended in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Detective James Svekric of the Cleveland Police Department.  During the trip back to Cleveland, appellant inquired who was using his name in connection with a homicide and robbery.  Up to this point, the arresting officers had informed appellant that he was wanted in connection with a homicide, but made no mention of the fact that appellant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was also charged with aggravated robbery.  Appellant maintained that he had been in Reading, Pennsylvania when the incident occurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 23, 1983, appellant entered a plea of not guilty at his arraignment March 23, 1984, after a trial by jury, appellant was found guilty as to all counts and specifications.  On March 28, 1984, the jury recommended the sentence of death.  On April 4, 1984, Judge Joseph McManamon accepted the jury's recommendation and ordered that appellant be put to death on July 11, 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant filed a timely appeal to the court of appeals on May 4, 1984.  On June 3, 1985, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction and sentence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery and imposed the death sentence. On review, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the judgments of conviction and sentence. Defendant filed an appeal. In affirming, the court found no error in the trial court's refusal to declare a mistrial as a result of the trial judge's allegedly prejudicial comments. The court explained that the remark at issue, when analyzed in light of the circumstances under which it was made, did not cast an aspersion upon defendant's innocence. Additionally, the court held that the trial court did not err in excluding prospective jurors who expressed some opposition to the imposition of the death penalty. The court found no error in the court's jury instructions, or in the trial court's refusal to administer the jury instruction requested by defense counsel on the credibility of testimony of addict-informers, informer co-defendants, and accomplices. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the judgments of conviction, as well as the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arises from a medical malpractice claim filed by appellant, Jean H. Deskins, against appellee, Robert E. S. Young, M.D.  The complaint alleged that on or about June 22, 1971, appellant underwent an operation, performed by appellee, to remove her gallbladder.  Twelve years later, on or about June 3, 1983, appellant underwent a second surgery.  At this time it was discovered that the first surgery was not complete.  A remant of appellant's gallbladder was removed.  Appellant averred in response to appellee's motion for summary judgment that she could not have discovered and did not discover that the first surgery was incomplete until she was so advised on the date of her second surgery.  Appellee admits to receiving timely written notice from appellant that she was contemplating an action against him, thus extending the statute of limitations by one-hundred-eighty days pursuant to R.C. 2305.11(A).  Appellant filed her claim against appellee on November 21, 1984. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee Leroy F. Egan was employed by appellant National Distillers &amp; Chemical Corporation, d.b.a. Emery Industries (&quot;National Distillers&quot;), at its chemical manufacturing and processing plant in Cincinnati, Ohio.  A chemical explosion occurred on February 18, 1982 at the plant and appellee was severely injured.  Four days later an application for workers' compensation benefits was filed on behalf of Egan.  The application was not contested by appellant which, as a self-insured employer, had paid the maximum workers' compensation benefits together with medical expenses.  In March 1983, appellee sought additional benefits for, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> post-traumatic neurosis.  These benefits were also awarded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately one year after the explosion, Leroy and Catherine S. Egan, appellees herein, filed a nine-count complaint against appellant.  The complaint essentially claims that Leroy's injuries resulted from intentional tort(s) committed by National Distillers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;We note that neither the sufficiency of the allegations contained in the complaint nor the question of whether National Distiller's acts constituted an intentional tort is before this court.  Rather, solely at issue in this review is whether the appellate court correctly reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thereafter, the trial court granted appellant's motion for summary judgment.  The trial court recognized that a complying employer is not entitled to the immunity of R.C. 4123.74 if an employee's injury is caused by the employer's intentional conduct.  However, the motion for summary judgment was nevertheless granted in favor of National Distillers.  The trial court essentially reasoned that under the doctrine of election of remedies, Leroy's receipt of workers' compensation payments estopped him from also maintaining a civil suit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals, relying on the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Jones </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. VIP Development Co</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1984), 15 Ohio St. 3d 90, reversed the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.  The appellate court reasoned that the &quot;doctrine of estoppel&quot; was not applicable to an employee's common-law action for damages against his employer for an intentional tort.  The court of appeals also observed that &quot;[i]t is immaterial whether the workers' compensation benefits are sought before, after or concurrently with the suit for common law damages.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 2, 1980, appellee, Emilia Kalain, was a passenger in a van driven by her husband which was heading west on a two-lane highway.  Appellant, Phyllis K. Smith, was driving a car that was heading in the same direction, in front of the Kalains' van.  A truck separated Smith's car and the van.  Kalain's husband began to pass the truck without sounding his horn to signal this intention.  At the same time, Smith allegedly activated her turn signal, slowed down and began to make a left turn.  The van and Smith's car collided. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalain filed suit against Smith in the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County.  The case was later transferred to Montgomery County and was tried before a jury.  The jury returned a $ 75,000 verdict for Kalain.  Smith did not appeal from the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, Kalain filed a motion under R.C. 1343.03(C) for prejudgment interest, alleging that Smith had failed to make a good faith effort to settle the case.  At a hearing on this motion, Kalain's counsel testified that prior to trial he contacted Smith's counsel and proposed to settle the case for $ 70,000.  This offer was later reduced to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $ 65,000.  Kalain's counsel testified that, although he advised Smith's counsel that Kalain was prepared to present testimony by an independent witness and by a State Highway Patrol officer that would substantiate Smith's liability, Smith's counsel responded that his client refused to pay &quot;one single dime.&quot; During trial, Kalain's counsel offered to settle the case for $ 60,000.  This offer was also rejected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalain complained that Smith's counsel had never disclosed that he had authority from his client's insurer to settle the case for $ 2,500.  In response, Smith's counsel and Harold Herrington, a claims superintendent from Smith's insurer, stated that the settlement authority was &quot;contingent,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">i.e.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smith's counsel was not required to offer $ 2,500 as &quot;nuisance&quot; value unless Kalain's counsel substantially reduced the $ 70,000 settlement offer.  Smith's counsel and the claims superintendent also testified that they believed Smith was neither negligent nor liable.  Their assessment was supported by the following facts: (1) Mr. Kalain had attempted to pass two vehicles at one time; (2) he had failed to sound his horn as required by R.C. 4511.27; (3) the passengers in Smith's car&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would testify that her turn signal had been on for an &quot;appreciable period of time&quot;; and (4) Kalain's primary witness had stated in a statement to an insurance company that she had not noticed whether Smith's turn signal had been activated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge granted the motion for prejudgment interest and assessed $ 24,801 against Smith, representing interest dating back to the day of the accident.  Smith appealed, alleging that the court had erred as a matter of law in awarding prejudgment interest and that R.C. 1343.03(C)&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived her of her right to a jury trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed, holding the statute to be constitutional and the award justified.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After appellee victim was awarded prejudgment interest under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1343.03(C) on a jury award in a personal injury action against appellant driver, the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio) affirmed, holding that &sect; 1343.03(C) was constitutional and the award justified. The record of the case was then certified for review and determination on the question whether a good faith effort to settle meant the absence of bad faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The victim was injured when the driver's car collided with the van in which the victim was a passenger. A trial court jury awarded damages to the victim in her action against the driver, and no appeal was taken. The victim than filed a motion for prejudgment interest pursuant to &sect; 1343.03(C), claiming that the driver failed to make a good faith effort to settle. The trial judge granted the motion, and the court of appeals affirmed. Subsequently, because of a conflict among the appellate courts, the court of appeals certified the case for review. The court held that because the driver had a reasonable good faith belief that he had no liability, he had no duty to make a monetary settlement offer pursuant to &sect; 1343.03(C). Further, the record reflected that the driver cooperated fully in discovery and did not attempt to unnecessarily delay any of the proceedings. Thus, the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded prejudgment interest to the victim. Also, because the standard for a &quot;good faith effort to settle&quot; did not require parties in all cases to make monetary settlement offers, &sect; 1343.03(C) did not infringe upon the driver's right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals that affirmed a trial court order awarding the victim prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Butler County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause concerns a dispute arising from the Manchester Road project in the city of Middletown (&quot;city&quot;), appellee herein.  As early as 1963, the city first considered the widening and improvement of Manchester Road as part of its master plan for development.  The city intended to upgrade the road from two lanes to a four-lane divided highway.  Appellants herein are abutting property owners who opposed the Manchester Road project. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Counsel of Governments, an organization responsible for distributing federal highway improvement funds, resolved that federal monies would be allocated to improve Manchester Road. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's next step was to pass the necessary legislation.  In May 1977, the city commissioners passed emergency Resolution No. R77-19, officially instructing the administration to proceed with the Manchester Road project.  Detailed plans for the road improvement project were drawn up and presented to the Ohio Department of Transportation (&quot;ODOT&quot;), which acted as contracting authority for the actual work and served as a conduit for federal funds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ODOT did approve the project&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and thereafter, on May 2, 1978, the city commissioners passed emergency Ordinance No. 078-93 directing the city manager to enter into contracts with ODOT for the improvement project.  The ordinance set forth the parties' contractual obligations.  A certified copy of the ordinance was signed by a city representative on May 12, 1978 and by ODOT on June 2, 1978.  As provided by the ordinance, the city agreed to bear the full cost of the project, less federal funds received, and to maintain the road after completion of the project.  ODOT was to supervise construction of the improvement.  The full text of this ordinance was published in the Middletown Journal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of passage of Ordinance No. 078-93, the estimated construction cost was $ 1,185,000.  The city expected federal funds to cover about seventy percent of the costs of the project, while it would bear the remaining thirty percent.  It has been stipulated by both parties to the instant case that &quot;[f]rom the inception of the Project, the City planned to finance most of its share of the cost by special assessments to the benefiting owners of * * * private property bounding or abutting Manchester Road * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 8, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1979, pursuant to the passage of Ordinance No. 079-19, two public hearings on the road improvement project were held.  It is stipulated that owners of twenty-seven of the affected properties, including all of the appellants herein, attended one or another of the hearings.  Appellants and other citizens expressed safety concerns about increased traffic on Manchester Road and concerns about the proposed assessments.  City officials explained the assessment process and responded to the safety concerns.  The city then typed Summary Minutes and Recommendations from the meetings and mailed it to all affected property owners. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 20, 1981, the city commission adopted emergency Resolution No. R81-03, declaring the necessity to improve Manchester Road and stating that bonds should be issued in anticipation of the collection of assessments levied on affected property owners.  A copy of this resolution was published in the Middletown Journal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After enactment of the resolution, the city's director of public service prepared estimated assessments.  Notice of the adoption of Resolution No. R81-03 and the estimated assessments were sent to all affected property owners.  Five owners filed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  objections, which were resolved by the Assessment Equalization Board. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1981, the city commission passed emergency Ordinance No. 081-44, stating its determination to proceed with the project and to levy the special assessments to pay the city's portion of the project's cost. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 9, 1981, several affected property owners filed with the clerk of the city commission a verified copy of an ordinance which they intended to make the subject of an initiative petition to be placed on the November ballot.  The text of the proposed ordinance called for the repeal of &quot;any and all further legislation&quot; adopted by the city commissioners having reference to the widening and improvement of Manchester Road.  The proposed ordinance also sought repeal of any and all commitments of the city of Middletown to the Manchester Road project. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While signatures for the initiative petition were being collected, on June 23, 1981, the city commission passed emergency Resolution No. R81-41 approving final plans for the project and appropriating approximately $ 330,000 from its general fund representing the city's share of the project cost.  This sum was paid to ODOT by the city and a formal contract&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between the parties was executed concurrently with the passage of the resolution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to the contract, ODOT apparently let bids for the construction phase of the project.  On July 27, 1981, ODOT awarded a contract for the construction to SK Construction Company.  Construction on the project commenced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on July 24, 1981, the Butler County Board of Elections validated sufficient signatures to have the initiative ordinance placed on the November ballot.  At the November 3, 1981 general election, the voters approved the initiative ordinance, thus repealing &quot;any and all&quot; Manchester Road enabling legislation and any and all commitments of the city to the project.  At the time of passage of the initiative ordinance, construction on the road widening and improvement was nearly sixty percent complete. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the effect of the initiative ordinance would have been to halt further construction on the project, the city believed the ordinance to be an unconstitutional impairment of an obligation of a contract and allowed construction to continue.  The project was completed by July 1, 1982. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 7, 1983, in conformance with previously passed enabling legislation, the city&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commission enacted ordinances levying the special assessments and providing for the issuance of bonds by the city to pay for its portion of the construction costs.  The bonds were to be retired by funds generated from the anticipated collection of assessments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that point, the salability of the bonds became an issue in light of the initiative ordinance and its possible effect on the prerequisite enabling legislation for the levying of the assessments.  The city then brought a bond validation action, pursuant to R.C. 133.71 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to establish its authority to issue the bonds and to establish that all of its previous resolutions and ordinances relating to the Manchester Road project were lawful and enforceable.  Appellants, Judy F. Sticklen, James L. Deger, Mary S. Rice and Frederick H. Cranford, owners of property affected by the project, became named defendants to the action in an attempt to block assessments against their properties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the city contended that the entire initiative ordinance was void </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an unconstitutional impairment of the city's contractual obligations with ODOT for construction of the project.  Appellants claimed that the city&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  had no standing to sue.  Appellants also argued that in the event that the portion of the initiative ordinance purporting to halt construction on the project was unconstitutional, that portion of the ordinance repealing assessments could be severed off and given full force and effect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court held (1) that the city had special statutory standing to bring its suit; (2) that the initiative's repeal of the assessment ordinance did not impair the city's contractual obligations; (3) that the primary aim of the initiative ordinance, to halt construction of the project, would have been an unconstitutional impairment of an obligation of a contract had construction been stopped; and (4) that the portion of the ordinance pertaining to assessments could not properly be severed from the portion of the ordinance halting construction.  Therefore, the trial court decided that the entire initiative ordinance was unconstitutional and thus void.  In its judgment entry of April 10, 1984, the trial court held that the city had the authority to issue its bonds and that all proceedings taken by the city in connection with the Manchester Road project were lawful and valid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  affirmed.  It reasoned that the initiative ordinance did impair the city's then-existing contractual obligations with ODOT on the effective date of its passage by the voters and that the ordinance was therefore void </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ab initio</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed an order finding that the city had the authority to issue its bonds and all proceedings regarding the project were lawful and valid and that the initiative ordinance was void ab initio. The city filed a motion to certify the record. On review, the court held that (1) the city had standing to sue under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 133.71(B); (2) as one of the effects of the initiative ordinance was to repeal all legislation necessary for the city to levy assessments it amounted to substantial impairment of the city's contractual rights under U.S. Const. art.

The court found that they were exempt from tax under the applicable statute. The court noted that the record fully supported the board's reversal of the commissioner's assessment. The court opined that the board's finding was supported by the record and was thus not unreasonable or unlawful. The court affirmed the holding that the purchases of the equipment used in the order filling process were not entitled to an exemption as equipment used in the consummation of a retail sale under the statute.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 2, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution provides that statutes may be enacted exempting public property from taxation if the property is used exclusively for any public purpose.  R.C. 5709.01 states that all real property in Ohio is subject to taxation unless expressly exempted therefrom.  R.C. 5709.08 states that &quot;* * * public property used exclusively for a public purpose shall be exempt from taxation.&quot; This case requires us to apply R.C. 5709.08, and to review the tax-exempt status of a publicly owned and managed golf course, a small portion of which is used with the intention of generating profit for private concerns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1971, the city of Columbus acquired a 196.5 acre parcel known as the Bolton Field Golf Course, and it has enjoyed tax-exempt status since that date.  The course, which is managed by the city Parks &amp; Recreation Division, includes a clubhouse containing a large maintenance area, lobby, snack shop, pro-shop and an efficiency apartment.  The snack shop is leased to a private concessioner for twenty-two percent of its gross sales.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The course pro is a city employee who is paid a small salary, and who&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  draws the balance of his income from the sale of pro-shop merchandise.  The efficiency apartment is rented for $ 80 per month to a non-city employee. The course is open to the general public.  In 1980, standard green fees were $ 4.50 per eighteen holes, while junior and senior golfers received reduced rates.  The course operates on a break-even budget, but lost about $ 3,400 in 1980.  The loss was subsidized by the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 31, 1980, appellant, the Board of Education of the South-Western City Schools, filed a complaint with the then Commissioner of Tax Equalization challenging the tax-exempt status of several properties owned by the city of Columbus, including the Bolton Field Golf Course.  The case was assigned to an attorney examiner and on May 19, 1982, he recommended that the golf course retain its tax-exempt status. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The school board objected to the recommendation and on July 28, 1982, the commissioner denied the complaint.  In 1985, the Board of Tax Appeals agreed with the attorney examiner's recommendation and affirmed the order of the commissioner. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The tax-exempt status of the other properties is not before the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The board of education argued that the golf course's tax-exempt status violated the equal protection guarantee of the state and federal constitutions and that the golf course was not entitled to tax-exempt status because it was not used exclusively for a public purpose. The court affirmed the decision of the board and found that the equal protection issue was not properly before the court since it was not raised or considered in the prior proceedings. The court reasoned that one who challenged the constitutional application of legislation to particular facts was required to raise that challenge at the first available opportunity during the proceedings before the administrative agency. The court also found that the renting of an apartment at the golf course did not violate the exclusivity requirement of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5709.08 because the apartment was rented to insure someone was available in the evenings to deter vandalism. The court found that the operation of the pro-shop or the snack-shop did not violate &sect; 5709.08 because the record did not reveal the extent of sales and therefore, did not render the board's determination unreasonable or unlawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CERTIFIED by the Court of Appeals for Lucas County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Sunset Fireworks Company, Inc. (&quot;Sunset&quot;) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Ohio and is engaged in the business of selling fireworks at two locations.  Its principal place of business is at 1800 Commerce Road in Holland, Ohio, and a warehouse and distribution center is at 10224 State Route 2, Curtice, Lucas County, Ohio.  The method and manner of appellant's sales are said to be in violation of R.C. 3473.32 and 3743.41. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pertinent facts of the instant case are as follows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant sold fireworks to various individuals at retail at both locations.  If the buyer had an Ohio residence, such individual was required to sign an affidavit that the goods would be shipped directly out of state and would not be used in the state of Ohio.  A similar affidavit was not required for purchasers who were out-of-state residents; all retail purchasers were required to certify that the goods would be used in accordance with the laws of the state of destination.  The fireworks were given to the purchaser for transportation and were not shipped by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellant.  On June 13, 14 and 16, 1983, Lucas County deputy sheriffs made certain purchases of fireworks from appellant at both locations.  On June 18 and 19, 1983, deputy sheriffs also stopped various motor vehicles improperly transporting fireworks from appellant's location in Curtice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 21, 1983, the Lucas County Prosecutor and Sheriff, appellees, filed a complaint seeking a permanent injunction against appellants, Sunset Fireworks Co., Inc. and its president, Anthony Cicerella (case No. CV83-1501).  On May 1, 1984, appellants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings (treated as a motion to dismiss).  On May 25, 1984, Sunset filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against appellees, together with motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction (case No. CV84-1361).  Upon the trial court's denial of the motion for a temporary restraining order, Sunset voluntarily dismissed the count for injunctive relief on May 29, 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both complaints were consolidated for a trial on the merits on May 29, 1984.  At trial, appellees established that appellants' principal place of business did not possess a license to sell fireworks&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  at wholesale.  Appellees also presented evidence demonstrating the various injuries sustained by people in the community as a result of playing with fireworks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 1, 1984, the trial court in case No. CV83-1501 denied appellants' motion to dismiss, found that a public nuisance existed and issued a permanent injunction against appellants.  A declaratory judgment was entered accordingly in case No. CV84-1361.  Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Lucas County on June 4, 1984.  On May 31, 1985, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgments.  On July 23, 1985, appellants filed a notice of appeal in this court (case No. 85-1134).  On July 22, 1985, the appellate court, finding the decision in the case </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sub judice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be in conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeals for Clermont County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Van Camp </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Riley</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1984), 16 Ohio App. 3d 457, certified the record of the case to this court for review and final determination (case No. 85-1269). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 13, 1985, these cases were consolidated as they involved identical facts, issues and arguments.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant seller challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Lucas County (Ohio), which affirmed the trial court's judgments. The trial court denied the seller's motion to dismiss, found that a public nuisance existed, and issued a permanent injunction against the seller. Appellee county prosecutor brought an action alleging that the seller's sale of fireworks was in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3473.32, 3743.41.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.33 permitted the retail sales of fireworks shipped directly out of state by a seller that was licensed by the Ohio Department of Industrial Relations as a wholesaler or manufacturer. The court also found that a seller could sell fireworks to a wholesaler, which would ship the fireworks out of state, that exhibited a wholesale permit or was known to have a wholesale permit issued pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.321. Therefore, the court found that any subterfuge between the seller and buyers by signing papers and affidavits that they were wholesalers when in fact they were not should be restrained. The court found that the seller did not ship the fireworks directly out of state but delegated the task to the purchaser of the fireworks, which was impermissible. The court found that the seller's sales in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3743.33 constituted a public nuisance, but any sales transactions within the permissive scope of that section could not be declared a public nuisance. The court found that the existence of a criminal sanction did not bar a civil action seeking the enjoinment of the nuisance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Melvin Hayes, was indicted by the Hamilton County Grand Jury on September 27, 1984.  The indictment specifically charged that appellee &quot;engaged in sexual conduct with Crystal Ellison, a person who was not Melvin Hayes' spouse at the time and at the time the said Melvin Hayes was the guardian or the custodian or the stepparent or a person standing in the place of a parent to Crystal Ellison, in violation of Section 2907.03 of the Revised Code * * *.&quot; R.C. 2907.03(A)(5) provides in pertinent part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(A) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another, not the spouse of the offender, when any of the following apply: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(5) The offender is the other person's natural or adoptive parent, or a stepparent, or guardian, custodian or person in loco parentis.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 10, 1984, appellee requested a bill of particulars pursuant to Crim. R. 7(E).  Appellant responded with a bill which stated in pertinent part: &quot;* * * Furthermore, at the time of the aforementioned sexual conduct, the defendant was a person standing in the place of a parent to Crystal Ellison.&quot; Appellant alleged that Crystal Ellison's parents&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  died and that she moved in with her aunt.  The aunt then married appellee, and he moved into the aunt's house.  Thus, it was appellant's theory that at the time of the sexual conduct, appellee was standing in the place of a parent living in the household.  Accordingly, appellant continued to proceed solely on the &quot;in loco parentis&quot; portion of R.C. 2907.03(A)(5). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 29, 1984, appellee filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the portion of R.C. 2907.03(A)(5) which contains the phrase &quot;in loco parentis&quot; was unconstitutionally vague.  On December 21, 1984, in a hearing on the motion, the trial court agreed with appellee that the statute, at least in its use of the Latin phrase &quot;in loco parentis,&quot; was unconstitutionally vague.  The trial court refused to dismiss the indictment, however, since appellee might also qualify as the guardian, custodian or stepparent of the alleged victim.  On January 22, 1985, at a continuance of the hearing, appellant essentially argued that by refusing to dismiss the entire indictment, the court had effectively prevented appellant from proceeding to trial.  The court, however, set a trial date for February 25, 1985 and entered the following ruling: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This matter having come on for hearing by this Court on the Motion of the defendant to Dismiss the Indictment and Bill of Particulars and the Court being fully advised in the matter does hereby grant said motion only to the extent that it finds: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The portion of O.R.C. 2907.03(A)(5) which uses the Latin words 'loco parentis' is in violation of the mandates of the Constitution of the Constitution of the United States [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] and the Constitution of the State of Ohio as being void for vagueness and is therefore unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In all other respects, said motion is denied.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant then appealed this ruling to the court of appeals.  The court of appeals held that there was no final order from which appellant could appeal and, consequently, dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.03.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was indicted for violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.03 because he allegedly engaged in sexual conduct with a girl of whom defendant was the guardian, custodian, stepparent, or a person standing in the place of the girl's parent. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, alleging that the portion of &sect; 2907.03(A)(5) that contained the phrase &quot;in loco parentis&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court agreed and dismissed the part of the indictment that included that particular language. However, the trial court refused to dismiss the remaining portions of the indictment. The State appealed the order insofar as it granted a portion of defendant's motion to dismiss. The court of appeals dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction because it held that there was no final order from which the State could appeal. The State appealed, and the court reversed the court of appeals' judgment. The court held that the court of appeals did have jurisdiction to hear the State's appeal. Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Fondessy Enterprises, Inc., owns and operates a hazardous waste landfill facility within the city of Oregon with a permit issued by the Ohio Hazardous Waste Facility Board under the authority of R.C. Chapter 3734.  Appellee's landfill facility is regulated by the Director of Environmental Protection under R.C. Chapter 3734 and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee acquired the site and operated it as a hazardous waste landfill by virtue of the permit from the Ohio Hazardous Waste Facility Board issued prior to January 23, 1984, when the appellant, city of Oregon, through its elected council adopted Ordinance No. 12-1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under this ordinance, a &quot;permit fee&quot; was imposed upon all hazardous waste landfills located within the city's borders &quot;for the purpose not to generate revenue, but for the sole purpose of generating sufficient funds in order to protect the environmental safety, health and welfare of its citizens.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinance required the landfill operators to keep complete and accurate records and manifests on forms provided by the city, showing the amount, type and volume of hazardous&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  waste disposed within the facility each day, and to remit monthly the &quot;permit fee&quot; and file the forms with the city's clerk auditor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee thereafter filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the common pleas court seeking to have the ordinance declared invalid.  Appellee also sought injunctive relief.  In its complaint, Fondessy alleged that the regulation of hazardous waste facilities in the state was preempted as a matter of law to the exclusion of all political subdivisions.  The trial court bifurcated the matter for hearing, reserving until later appellee's claim that the ordinance violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and the state of Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the hearing, the trial court held that R.C. 3734.05(D)(3) precluded the operation of Ordinance No. 12-1984 and entered judgment for appellee.  Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed. </SPAN></P>

The trial court and lower appellate court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3734.05(D)(3) expressly preempted appellant from enacting the ordinance. The supreme court first found that the power of the municipality to enact local police regulations was derived directly from Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 and that the statute could not nullify the police power granted by the constitution. Furthermore, the court held that absent any conflict between an ordinance and statute, the state and municipality had concurrent authority under their respective police powers to enforce their respective directives within the corporate limits of the city. In reversing the lower courts, the supreme court held that the ordinance did not conflict with the statute because the ordinance did not allow anything that the statute prohibited nor did it prohibit anything permitted by the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arises as a result of an appeal by appellants, Charles W. and Charlotte A. Ewing, concerning two sales tax assessments totalling over $ 78,000.  the assessments were issued to appellants' company, Ewing Lumber Company, Inc., for unpaid sales tax to the state for various periods commencing January 1977 and ending December 31, 1979.  Appellants were officers and employees of Ewing Lumber Company.  The company's corporate assets were seized and sold in September 1980, and the company became insolvent. </SPAN></P>

The taxpayers appealed to the court as a matter of right, challenging the constitutionality of &sect;5739.33, and claiming that the commissioner failed to establish that the taxpayers were the responsible corporate officers for purposes of &sect; 5739.33. The court affirmed the board's decision, holding that both propositions lacked merit. The fact that a federal provision contained an element which the state statute did not was an insufficient reason to declare &sect; 5739.33&nbsp;unconstitutional, and the court specifically found that the provisions of &sect; 5739.33 were compatible with federal and state constitutional provisions. Section 5739.33 was not void for vagueness, not overbroad, and did not create an unconstitutional presumption.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 1, 1984, appellee, Fred D. Rohdes, Jr., killed Paul E. Boysel, Jr., with one shot to the head from a handgun, outside appellee's house where he lived with Tamara A. Korb.  That day, Korb arranged a ride home with Boysel, her supervisor at work.  An argument erupted after the two entered the residence and appellee ordered Boysel to leave.  According to appellee's testimony at trial, he picked up a .38 caliber handgun from a gun rack on the wall and displayed it for the purpose of causing Paul to believe that he would use the gun on him if he &quot;had to.&quot; Boysel left the house, followed by appellee, where the argument continued, and moments later the gun was discharged from a distance of about ten feet.  Appellee testified that he slipped in the snow or tripped over some other object in his house slippers, and the resultant shooting was an accident. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After appellee telephoned for help, Michael DeVita, the first patrolman to arrive on the scene, approached the appellee's residence from the front and walked around it until he came upon an open side door.  Appellee and Korb approached the door from the inside&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the house, and led the officer to the victim's body, approximately twenty feet away.  Appellee told the officer he had shot the victim and that it was an accident, and requested to re-enter the house to get another pair of shoes.  Two additional officers arrived, arrested appellee, and transported him to the Lima Police Station.  Lieutenant John J. Griesdorn arrived and, after questioning DeVita as to his knowledge of other victims in the house, entered the house with other officers.  One of those officers saw a gun lodged between the cushions of the living room couch, and seized the weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee was indicted for murder with a firearm specification.  Based upon the evidence adduced at trial, the state requested that jury instructions be given on voluntary manslaughter, which request was overruled, and on involuntary manslaughter based on the underlying offense of aggravated menacing, which request was granted.  The trial court also overruled appellee's request for an instruction on negligent homicide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was thus instructed as to murder and involuntary manslaughter by aggravated menacing and the firearm specification.  It returned a verdict of not guilty of murder&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but guilty of the involuntary manslaughter and firearm specification.  The court of appeals reversed on two grounds: (1) involuntary manslaughter by aggravated menacing is not a lesser included offense of murder and thus appellee was found guilty of a crime not charged; and (2) conclusory statements of Korb were unlawfully admitted into evidence to appellee's prejudice. </SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed on the grounds that involuntary manslaughter by aggravated menacing was not a lesser included offense of murder, and that a witness's conclusory statements were unlawfully admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant shot and killed a man following an argument. He alleged that he displayed a gun to cause the man to believe that he would use it if he had to, but that he fired it accidentally. Defendant was indicted for murder and was convicted in the trial court of involuntary manslaughter by aggravated menacing. The court of appeals reversed. On further review, the court reversed and reinstated the trial court's judgment. The court held that the jury was properly instructed on involuntary manslaughter because it was a lesser included offense of murder, in that is was a crime of a lesser degree, the intent element of murder was not required to prove it, and the jury reasonably found on the evidence that the murder could not have been committed without also committing involuntary manslaughter by way of aggravated menacing. The court also held that testimony as to a witness's statements containing her appraisal of the incident was admissible because as the sole witness her view of the events was relevant, its probative value was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect, and, pursuant to Ohio R. Evid. 704, it was not inadmissible solely because it embraced an ultimate issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 31, 1980, Myrtle R. Davis executed a will in which she made specific bequests of $ 10,000 to a niece, $ 5,000 to a half-brother, $ 10,000 to the &quot;Burns Institute, Cincinnati Unit&quot; of the Shriners' Hospital for Crippled Children, $ 5,000 to the Salvation Army, $ 5,000 to the Fairfield Church of God, and $ 10,000 to the Twin Wells Indian School.  Davis' will also made a residual bequest dividing the remainder of her estate equally between the &quot;Burns Institute, Cincinnati Unit&quot; of the Shriners' Hospital for Crippled Children and the Twin Wells Indian School. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 25, 1980, Davis executed a new will, expressly revoking her previous will but altering the terms of that will only by reducing the bequest to her niece from $ 10,000 to $ 5,000 and by appointing a new executor.  All other bequests in the will of July 25, 1980 were identical to those in Davis' previous will of January 31, 1980. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 9, 1980, less than four months after the execution of her last will, Davis died.  Davis' will was admitted to probate in Butler County; but, prior to the completion of probate, the plaintiff-appellee herein, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shriners' Hospital for Crippled Children (&quot;Shriners&quot;), filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County.  Stephen M. Hester (the executor of Davis' estate), the named charitable beneficiaries under Davis' will, Davis' grandchildren (her heirs-at-law), and the Attorney General of Ohio were joined as parties to the Shriners' action, which sought a judgment declaring that R.C. 2107.06, Ohio's mortmain statute, was unconstitutional or otherwise inapplicable to Davis' beneficiaries.  The matter was transferred to the probate division of the common pleas court and an evidentiary hearing was held. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 23, 1984, judgment was entered whereby the trial court upheld the constitutionality of R.C. 2107.06, found that R.C. 2107.06 was applicable to Davis' last will, and refused to adopt the doctrine of dependent relative revocation, which would have enabled the court to revive the terms of Davis' prior will of January 31, 1980.  The trial court ordered that, pursuant to R.C. 2107.06, the charitable bequests in Davis' last will &quot;are to be honored to the extent that they do not exceed twenty-five [percent] (25%) of the value of the net probate estate. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That portion of the charitable bequests * * * which exceed[s] twenty-five [percent] (25%) of the value of the net probate estate, shall be distributed in accordance with intestate succession to the five grandchildren of the deceased, * * * in equal shares.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shriners appealed to the Court of Appeals for Butler County; and, on March 18, 1985, the appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court.  The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in refusing to adopt the doctrine of dependent relative revocation, but it expressly refused to address Shriners' challenge to the constitutionality of R.C. 2107.06.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 21, 1983, the body of Leoma Chmielewski, a seventy-six-year-old woman, was discovered lying face down on the floor of her home.  An autopsy revealed that the decedent had suffered multiple blunt force injuries to the head and neck, as well as a single gunshot wound fired from close range (approximately two feet or less) into the victim's face. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses established that the decedent was last seen between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m. the evening of the 20th, standing in her doorway talking with appellant, Lewis Williams.  Between 10:30 and 11:00, the victim's neighbors heard a sound from her house like a door slamming.  Appellant was arrested on January 22, 1983 and admitted being in the house the night of the murder, but denied perpetrating the offenses for which he was indicted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence produced at appellant's trial established the following sequence of events.  Early in the evening of January 20, 1983, appellant and two acquaintances, Brent Nicholson and Tyrone Robinson, visited and had dinner with appellant's cousin, Kevin Samuels.  Samuels lives across the street from the victim's house and had known&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her for several years.  Prior to the night of the incident in question, appellant had stayed with Samuels and had known the victim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of the 20th, Robinson and appellant left the Samuels residence, at approximately 9:00 p.m., to go to the store.  Only Robinson returned a half-hour later, indicating appellant was still at the store.  At trial, however, Robinson testified that appellant was in fact at Chmielewski's house, where he had apparently been invited in.  The remarks to the contrary were merely to dissuade appellant's brother, Mark, who had arrived at the Samuels residence, from looking for appellant.  Robinson eventually told Mark where appellant was, and the two of them went over to Chmielewski's house where Mark prevailed upon his brother to return some money.  Mark left and Robinson went back to Samuels' house.  Samuels sent Robinson back over to ask appellant to return to the Samuels residence.  Appellant's responses were to tell Robinson he was not ready to leave and to call Samuels and tell him to mind his own business. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuels, Nicholson, and Robinson were driving down the Samuels driveway around 10:30 p.m. when Samuels saw appellant and Chmielewski at&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  her door.  They honked the horn, but appellant motioned for the car to proceed without him.  When Nicholson and Samuels returned, a little over an hour later, Nicholson went across the street to find that the door was open and Chmielewski's body was on the floor.  Nicholson returned to the Samuels residence, whereupon Samuels called appellant's mother's home, then the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the police arrived, at approximately 1:00 a.m., January 21, 1983, they found not only the body, but also several coins scattered near the doorway, numerous bank envelopes throughout the house and down to the street corner, decedent's purse with its contents emptied on the bedroom closet shelf, decedent's false teeth on the floor next to the body, and the phone off the hook.  A subsequent police investigation revealed an imprint on the hem of the nightgown decedent was wearing which matched a portion of a shoe appellant was wearing the day of his arrest.  Appellant's jacket sleeve cuff also contained a trace of lead powder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the above evidence, the state presented two witnesses who were former cellmates of appellant while he was confined to the Cuyahoga County Jail pending trial.  Michael&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anderson and Navarro Brooks each testified that appellant had told them he had murdered the decedent.  Specifically, Anderson testified that appellant had said he &quot;stuck the gun in her mouth&quot; to get her &quot;to shut up.&quot; Brooks testified that appellant was worried about blood on his shoes apparently from rolling decedent's body over with his foot.  After this testimony, the state rested, as did the appellant, without presenting any evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found appellant guilty of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01, and the accompanying specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) of having committed the aggravated murder in the course of committing an aggravated robbery, for which the death penalty could be imposed.  The jury also found appellant guilty of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01, as well as the firearm specification contained in R.C. 2929.71. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 13, 1983, the sentencing phase of the trial commenced.  Appellant presented three witnesses, his father, sister, and a friend, in addition to making an unsworn statement on his own behalf.  The evidence in mitigation was essentially: that appellant was relatively young (twenty-four); that he came from a broken&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  home; that he loved his mother more than himself, but that she rejected him; and that he elected to pursue a life of crime in order to compensate for a lack of love during his childhood.  After more than twenty-three hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the factors offered in mitigation, and sentencing appellant to death.  This conviction and sentence were affirmed by both the trial court and the court of appeals, after each made an independent determination that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. </SPAN></P>

Defendant raised numerous assignments of error, all of which the court found to be without merit. The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence of record by which a jury could find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and to support the imposition of the death sentence. The court stated that the aggravating circumstance was the commission of a senselessly cruel aggravated murder in the course of an aggravated robbery, and defendant had failed to produce any evidence of the mitigating factors listed in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.04(B). The court also stated that the trial court did not err in finding defendant competent to stand trial, because defendant failed to produce any evidence to rebut the presumption, contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.37(A), that a criminal defendant was competent. Finally, the court ruled that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that its recommendation of the death penalty was not binding on the court.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was commenced in the court of appeals as a complaint for a writ of mandamus.  Appellants, John Zone et al., alleged that they are or were members of the skilled crafts and as such are or were members of the Cleveland Building and Construction Trades Council.  They further alleged that they acted as foremen, assistant foremen, leadmen or general foremen while employed by the appellee city of Cleveland (hereinafter the &quot;city&quot;).  Appellants brought their action on behalf of themselves and all skilled tradesmen who acted similarly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially, appellants alleged that the city and other city officials violated Section 191 of the Charter of the city of Cleveland and Ordinance No. 2356-48 by failing and refusing to pay the prevailing rate of wage scales for foreman as negotiated between the Cleveland Building and Construction Trades Council and the Local Building Trades Employers Association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants alleged that they are or were foremen for the city, and were not paid the prevailing rate mandated by such ordinance.

The city employees contended on appeal that they were entitled to back pay under Cleveland, Ohio, Charter &sect; 191 and Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance No. 2356-48 (December 1948) because de facto appointments to foreman positions had occurred. The court affirmed the summary judgment against the city employees. The court concluded that the city employees' claims for back pay were barred because they had not been formally appointed foremen as provided by the city's civil service commission. The court determined that the city employees were on notice that supervisors that assigned them to perform tasks outside the classifications to which they been formally appointed lacked authority to create different classifications or to make appointments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEALS from the Court of Appeals for Lorain County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 8, 1983, appellant, Howard D. Wilmoth, was indicted on one count of receiving stolen property in violation of R.C. 2913.51, and one count of possession of criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24.  On the same date, appellant, Bernard H. Wilmoth, was indicted on eight counts of receiving stolen property in violation of R.C. 2913.51, one count of possession of criminal tools in violation of R.C. 2923.24, and one count of concealing the identity of a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 4549.07. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 16, 1983, the appellants timely filed motions to suppress the evidence.  On June 28, 1984, the trial court granted the motions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts contained in the record provide that when the police became aware of possible criminal activity at the shop at 732 Idaho Avenue in Lorain, they established a round-the-clock surveillance.  On the morning of December 21, 1982, two vehicles, which were believed to have been stolen, were observed being driven into the shop.  At that point, the police sought a search warrant.  A warrant was obtained and Lorain police officers conducted a search of the shop.  Numerous items were&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  seized from the shop, the surrounding area, and vehicles located in or about the shop, resulting in the charges filed against the appellants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search was conducted pursuant to a search warrant issued by a Lorain County common pleas judge.  It is the procedure in obtaining the warrant which is the focus in this appeal.  The warrant was issued on the basis of oral statements given to the magistrate by Sergeant Jack D. Daniel and Patrolman Thomas M. DeNicola of the Lorain Police Department.  The oral statements were being recorded as the officers testified before the magistrate.  Their recorded statements, later transcribed, provided information concerning stolen motor vehicles being delivered to a &quot;chop shop.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probable cause is not an issue on appeal.  However, a brief summary of the officers' testimony is necessary.  Sergeant Daniel testified concerning the background information which led to the surveillance.  He stated that the Cleveland Police Department alerted the Lorain County Sheriff's office that stolen vehicles were being transported to a shop at 732 Idaho Avenue.  The Cleveland police obtained this information from David Hill, who admitted stealing the cars for Bernard&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wilmoth.  The Lorain police then began a surveillance of this address.  At the same time, they learned that this shop was being rented by John Wilmoth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel then testified in detail concerning information the police obtained from four informants.  The various informants had described the activities of the appellants and the activities of the shop.  Daniel informed the magistrate that based on the information received from these four informants, the police set up a twenty-four hour surveillance.  Their surveillance revealed that cars were being driven into the shop but were never seen exiting the shop.  They also observed trucks entering and exiting.  Daniel submitted police reports which detailed the activity observed during the surveillance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeNicola then testified concerning the activity he observed the morning of December 21, 1982.  He claimed two new cars were brought into the shop.  A computer registration check revealed that both cars were stolen vehicles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving the testimony of Daniel and DeNicola, the magistrate swore them in and then proceeded to issue the search warrant.  The testimony of the December 21, 1982 hearing was subsequently transcribed.  On January&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3, 1983, the issuing magistrate and both of the officers certified that the transcript was an accurate record of the December 21, 1982 hearing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the warrant in question </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">was not issued on the basis of written affidavits but on the oral statements of the two officers and their submitted police reports</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The state argued that the reason the affidavits were prepared in this manner was because all the intelligence gathered prior to the search showed the operation at 732 Idaho Avenue, Lorain, Ohio, to be a &quot;chop shop&quot; for cars that are immediately (in less than one hour) and completely dismantled with all identifying characteristics destroyed.  In other words, the loss and/or destruction of the evidence was imminent.  Later testimony revealed that one of the two stolen cars seen entering the shop on December 21, 1982 was completely dismantled with the identifying marks destroyed by the time the police entered with the warrant and the other car was in the state of partial disassembly.  The completely disassembled vehicle was on its way down the highway in the back of a panel truck. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the transcript of the police officers' oral statements revealed they were not sworn&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in prior to giving their statements.  However, they were sworn in twice.  The first time the tape recorder was not on.  The second time the tape was running and the following exchange occurred: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Prosecutor:] Hang on, swear them in again Judge, we * * *. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Judge:] Oh, I see * * *. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Prosecutor:] Didn't get that on the tape. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Judge:] Alright, please stand and raise your right hands, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">are about to give</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on to enable you to obtain a search warrant is the truth so help you God? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Patrolman DeNicola]: I do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Sergeant Daniel]: I do.&quot; (Emphasis added.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court subsequently ruled that the evidence seized during the search should be suppressed for two reasons.  First, the police failed to submit a written affidavit to obtain the warrant, as required by Crim. R. 41(C).  Second, the officers did not testify under oath, as required by the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals reversed the decision of the trial court.  The appellate court found that failure to provide a written affidavit did not require suppression of evidence; that the error of the magistrate in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  giving the oath did not invalidate the search warrant; and even if the search warrant were invalid, the avowed purpose of the exclusionary rule would not be served by suppression of the evidence because the search warrant was executed in good faith by the police officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants were indicted for receiving stolen property, possessing criminal tools, and concealing the identity of a motor vehicle in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51, 2923.24, and 4549.07 arising from their operation of a chop shop. The Court of Appeals for Lorain County (Ohio) reversed the order granting their motion to suppressed evidence found during a search of the chop shop. Defendants brought a motion for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendants argued that the search warrant was defective and required the suppression of any evidence obtained during the search. Specifically, defendants argued that Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(C) required a warrant to be based on written affidavits and this one was based on oral statements, and that the police officers, when making their oral statements, did not do so under oath as required by the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. The court held that these defects did not warrant the suppression of the evidence. The court found that the violation was an unintentional technical violation and not a violation of constitutional magnitude. The court concluded that there had been no prejudice to defendants and that the oral affidavit complied with the spirit of Rule 41. The court determined that the failure of the magistrate to use the proper verb tense in administering the oath did not require a finding that the oath was constitutionally infirm. The court noted that everyone made every effort to do the right thing under a very hurried time frame to circumvent the destruction of stolen motor vehicles and gather the evidence necessary to arrest defendants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of July 27, 1983, appellant, Eddie Jackson, walked into the Fifth District Police Station in Cleveland and informed Officer Patrick Wood that he had shot someone.  The victim, Malvin L. Young, died of a gunshot wound to the chest.  The killing had occurred some time after 7:00 that evening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted for the aggravated murder of Young in violation of R.C. 2903.01.  The indictment also contained a gun specification.  Appellant pleaded not guilty and at trial raised the affirmative defense of self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony at trial, as to events leading up to the shooting, was conflicting.  It can fairly be said that appellant and the victim were the closest of friends.  The victim had free access to come and go as he pleased from appellant's apartment.  There was testimony from two witnesses that appellant and the victim had been involved in a homosexual relationship.  The state's witness, Delora Kilpatrick, also testified that she had lived with the victim for three and one-half years and bore his child.  Kilpatrick stated that appellant was jealous of her because she interfered with his relationship&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the victim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of the shooting, appellant and a group of friends were gathered in his apartment when the victim arrived.  An argument ensued and the victim hit appellant who fell into the lap of one of his guests.  Appellant's nephew escorted the victim out of appellant's apartment.  The victim returned and a struggle ensued.  Appellant, the victim, and the nephew ended up in the yard outside appellant's apartment.  After this second struggle, the victim was again restrained and the fight broken up.  At this point appellant stepped inside his apartment and immediately returned with a gun.  As the victim began to walk up the porch stairs toward the outside doorway of appellant's apartment, appellant fatally shot him.  The deputy coroner, Marilee H. Frazer, testified that at the time of death, the victim's blood-alcohol content was .11 percent and that traces of cocaine were found in his urine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, appellant told the jury that he feared the victim was going to kill him and shot only in self-defense.  Appellant also argued that the state could not constitutionally place upon him the burden of proving self-defense and submitted the following proposed jury instruction: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The burden of going forward with the evidence of self-defense is upon the defendant.  The burden of proving the absence of self-defense is upon the prosecution.  The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of the elements of self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the prosecution fails to satisfy you that beyond a reasonable doubt Defendant did not act in self-defense, you must acquit Defendant of the charge against him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are satisfied that beyond a reasonable doubt Defendant did not act in self-defense, the affirmative defense of self-defense is not available to Defendant.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant also submitted the following proposed special jury instruction relative to his duty to retreat before killing in self-defense: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The doctrine followed in Ohio is that if a person is assailed without fault, and in a place where he has a right to be, and put in reasonably apparent danger of losing his life or receiving great bodily harm, he need not retreat, but may stand his ground, repel force by force, and if, in the reasonable exercise of his right of self-defense, he kills his assailant, he is justified.  Consequently, there is no duty to retreat where the assault is violent and produces&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  imminent danger of death or great bodily harm to the person attacked.  Whether or not the person attacked could safely have retreated from the violent attack, he is not obliged to do so, even if it was within the power of the person attacked to retreat.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court overruled both of appellant's proposed instructions.  Appellant later noted his objections thereto.  The court instead gave general instructions on self-defense in accordance with Ohio law and charged the jury, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that appellant was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he acted in self-defense.  The trial court's general instruction on the elements of self-defense stated that the defendant must show: (1) that he was not at fault in giving rise to the affray, (2) that he had a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that his only means of escape from danger was the use of such force, and (3) that he did not violate any duty to retreat or avoid the danger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found appellant guilty of the lesser included offense of murder and he was sentenced to the statutory term of fifteen years to life with a three-year consecutive term by reason&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the gun specification. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, appellant renewed his contention that the state of Ohio could not, consistent with due process, require him to meet the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  Appellant also assigned as error the trial court's refusal to submit his proposed special instruction on the duty to retreat to the jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals found appellant's assignments of error not well-taken and affirmed his conviction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed the appellate court's affirmance of the judgment of conviction against defendant for murder, rejecting his claims of self-defense. The appellate court's judgment was affirmed. The court held where the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of a crime as defined by statute, defendant was required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the affirmative defense of self-defense. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.05. As long as the prosecution was required to prove the elements of a crime, there was no additional constitutional requirement to prove the absence of self-defense. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, was not offended by placing the burden of going forward with the affirmative defense of self-defense on the accused pursuant to &sect; 2901.05. Further, the court held that the failure to give the special instruction on the duty to retreat neither affected defendant's substantial rights nor contributed to his conviction. Ohio R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Hamiltion County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal concerns the constitutionality of a strip search.  The plaintiff's evidence is summarized as follows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 9, 1982, DeAnna L. Fricker, plaintiff-appellee, was driving home from work to study for college examinations scheduled for the next morning.  A Cincinnati police officer stopped her for speeding.  (Fricker admitted at trial of the instant cause that she had been speeding.) The officer ran a computer check and discovered that a capias warrant had been issued in Fricker's name for failure to appear in court on a charge of driving while under the influence.  When the officer informed Fricker of the outstanding capias, she denied ever having received a citation and insisted that a mistake had been made.  Indeed, although the capias warrant was facially accurate, DeAnna Fricker had not committed the underlying offense; rather, Fricker's sister Katherine had been arrested and falsely gave her name as DeAnna Fricker.  The underlying charge against Fricker was eventually dismissed.  The officer transported Fricker to the precinct where he verified and reverified the capias.  No search of Fricker of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any kind was made at the precinct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fricker telephoned her mother from the precinct, but bond arrangements were not made.  Then, another officer transported Fricker to the Community Correctional Institute (&quot;C.C.I.&quot;) where Fricker was to be held until she could appear before the Hamilton County Municipal Court.  Upon arrival at C.C.I., the transporting officer delivered Fricker to the matrons and told them that Fricker had been &quot;no problem&quot; and had been &quot;cooperative.&quot; When Fricker heard the gates slam shut behind her, she began to plead with the matron, insisting on her innocence.  Having never been incarcerated before, Fricker became increasingly frightened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A C.C.I. matron told Fricker to remove her jewelry.  Concerned that her jewelry might be stolen or lost, Fricker asked repeatedly why it was being taken.  The matron provided no explanation.  Reluctantly, Fricker complied with the demand.  Then the matron told Fricker to remove the bobby pins from her hair.  The matron apparently became irritated because Fricker so slowly complied with her requests, so the matron &quot;started ripping the bobby pins&quot; out of Fricker's hair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fricker, who could see lit cigarettes and smoke coming&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  out of jail cells, reached to get a cigarette from her purse which was on a counter.  The matron slammed her hand on top of Fricker's and said, &quot;[N]o.&quot; Fricker, frustrated, &quot;threw&quot; her purse and it fell off the counter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, matrons took each of Fricker's arms and escorted her to a cell.  Fricker began cursing.  She told the matrons that she had final exams in the morning and that she needed to leave.  Once Fricker was in the cell, a matron called Fricker a &quot;bitch&quot; and shoved her so that her head hit a concrete wall, hard enough to stun Fricker and to affect her vision.  Fricker crawled over to a cot and sat down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matron then ordered Fricker to take off her clothes; Fricker refused.  The matron offered no explanation; she told Fricker that if she did not remove her clothes, her clothes would be forcibly removed.  Fricker became afraid that if she failed to comply she would be harmed.  Determined to retain her dignity, Fricker took off her clothing one piece at a time, waiting to be ordered to take off each article including her brassiere, underpants, and rubber thongs.  Finally, the matron grabbed Fricker's reading glasses from her face, and told her to stand up and squat. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The matron glanced at Fricker, then left.  Fricker testified that she &quot;felt raped&quot; by the search process. </SPAN></P>

She sued the sheriff, and the trial court directed a verdict for him. The appellate court reversed, holding that the trial court did not properly employ a required balancing test because the directed verdict was granted at the close of the student's evidence, and there was no evidence of facility's security interests. On appeal, the court affirmed the appellate court. Evidence that the student was never asked if she was concealing contraband, was never patted down, her clothes were never searched, and that the search was visual only and incomplete showed that the facility had no apparent legitimate and substantial institutional justification. Reasonable minds could have easily found that the strip search was performed as policy or to humiliate her for her protestations of innocence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 26, 1978, appellee, Personal Service Insurance Co. (&quot;PSI&quot;), issued a surety bond on behalf of a strip mining permit holder who had been granted the permit pursuant to R.C. 1513.08.  The permit holder, Mack Mining, Inc., commenced its strip mining operations, but defaulted on its obligation to reclaim the strip mined land as required under R.C. 1513.16.  In March 1981, the Division of Reclamation notified PSI of Mack's default and demanded that PSI pay the bond or reclaim the land.  As a result of the default, PSI elected to perform the reclamation itself instead of making payments under the bond. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relevant to this action, the General Assembly enacted R.C. 1513.02(F)(1), effective September 1, 1981, which provides in part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A person who violates a permit condition or any other provision of Chapter 1513 of the Revised Code may be assessed a civil penalty by the chief * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 23, 1983, appellant, Larry W. Mamone, Chief of the Division of Reclamation, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, issued &quot;Proposed Civil Penalty Assessment Number 1523&quot; to PSI for committing a violation of the reclamation performance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  standards by allowing a sediment pond to fill beyond the legally permissible limit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 24, 1983, PSI filed a motion before the Reclamation Board of Review (&quot;board of review&quot;) to dismiss the proposed civil penalty.  Shortly thereafter, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to PSI's motion.  After a hearing, the board of review vacated the proposed civil penalty assessment on two grounds: (1) the assessment was an invalid retroactive application of law which, in effect, changes the terms of the surety's contract; and (2) the assessment is inconsistent with law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal the court of appeals affirmed, holding that the proposed civil penalty assessment was an unconstitutional impairment of the surety contract in violation of Section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution and Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

The chief proposed a civil penalty assessment against the surety for committing a violation of the reclamation performance standards by allowing a sediment pond to fill beyond the legally permissible limit. The board of review vacated the proposed civil penalty. The lower court affirmed, finding that the proposed civil penalty was an unconstitutional impairment of the surety contract. The chief appealed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the proposed civil penalty did not unconstitutionally impair the surety contract because it merely sought to penalize the surety for violation of reclamation standards.Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1513.02(F)(1), the surety was a &quot;person&quot; subject to a civil penalty assessment. Nor did the prohibition against retroactive laws apply to a sanction levied for a present violation of an existing law.Also, the enforcement techniques afforded the chief were cumulative and not mutually exclusive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County. On Saturday afternoon, July 17, 1982, eleven-year-old Krista Lee Harrison and a schoolmate collected aluminum cans in a ballpark </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> across the street from Krista's home.  Krista was kidnapped from that park in broad daylight and was never seen alive again. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Marshallville Park in Marshallville, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The schoolmate, Roy Wilson, testified that while they were picking up cans, a maroon-colored van with bubble-type side windows entered the park.  The van, which had white-lettered tires, was positioned to face the road.  The sole occupant, a man with dark brown curly-hair, a long mustache and a big nose, got out.  He walked over to the park bleachers and sat down near Krista's ten-speed bike.  A few minutes later, Wilson saw Krista talking to the stranger.  Wilson testified that he saw the man reach inside Krista's blouse several times and each time she would knock his hand away.  When Krista got on her bike to leave, the man felt under her blouse again&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and whispered something into her ear.  Krista began to cry, got off her bike and got into the van.  She sat on the carpeted floor between two black seats.  As the van drove off, Wilson rode Krista's bike from the park and alerted Krista's family.  Her parents called the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six days later, in a remote area of Holmes County, Ohio, Krista's body was found beside a shed on Township Road 464.  An autopsy revealed that Krista had been viciously sexually assaulted by the thrusting of a rigid object against the inlet of her vagina and then strangled to death.  Her feet were bound with a large piece of plastic and tape.  Her hair and clothing showed the presence of orange carpet fibers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a search of the scene and surrounding area, several articles of clothing were found, including a man's pair of paint-spotted blue jeans and two gloves.  The gloves showed the presence of orange carpet fibers.  While police investigated on Township Road the next day, a George Dawson turned over to them a shirt, with a &quot;Mike's Place&quot; label, which he said he took from the road on July 23, 1982. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence was also collected the next day along Fair Road in Wayne County, Ohio.  This included a clump&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of hair, a blanket, a green garbage bag with tape on it, and two pieces of cardboard box with the shipping label sprayed over with black paint.  Further investigation revealed that the shipping label read &quot;Sears.&quot; There were orange carpet fibers on the blanket, the cardboard pieces and on hairs found on the blanket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Cappy, a laboratory supervisor at the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (&quot;BCI&quot;) in London, Ohio compared the carpet fibers removed from the evidence collected on Township and Fair Roads.  The orange synthetic fibers matched in color, shape and material content.  Comparisons were also made of hair removed from the evidence and a hair sample from Krista.  The hairs matched in color, texture and microscopic characteristics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1982, investigation and testing by the police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (&quot;FBI&quot;) disclosed that the plastic found around Krista's feet and the cardboard pieces were packing materials used for van seats sold by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company.  On or about November 3, 1982, the name of the appellant surfaced in a search through the records of purchasers of these seats.  Receipts showed that the appellant purchased&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  two of these seats just sixteen or seventeen days before Krista's abduction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No other evidence linked the appellant with the murder until mid-October 1983 when he was arrested and charged with other crimes.  Police executed search warrants at appellant's residence and removed, among other things, a roll of orange-colored carpeting, cans of blue and tan paint, interior and exterior paint samples, a newspaper article with Krista's picture in it dated August 9, 1983, a plaid shirt containing a &quot;Mike's Place&quot; label, black spray paint and a 1978 maroon Dodge van. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent testing by the BCI and FBI determined that carpet fibers from the van matched fibers found on Krista's clothes.  The fibers on the blanket matched fibers from the appellant's van and residence.  The paint samples were compared to the paint spots on the jeans.  These tests determined the blue and tan paint samples matched those on the spotted jeans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold Seawell, director of technical services for the carpet division of J.P. Stevens Company, identified the orange-colored carpet taken from appellant's home and van.  Seawell testified that only twelve thousand fifteen square yards of the carpeting were ever produced&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and of that only seventy-four yards were ever sent to Northern Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Kaskey, the manager of the loan adjustment department of Centran Bank of Akron, testified that appellant had purchased the van on October 22, 1980 in a stripped condition.  The van had round or oval bubble-shaped side windows and was burgundy in color.  Kaskey also testified that although work to the van's exterior had been contemplated, it was still unpainted when he saw it again in 1983. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellant's nephew, Ralph Ross, Jr., lived with him from February through July 1982.  Ross testified that during those months appellant installed orange-colored carpet in his van like that in his home, and two new black seats.  Appellant also replaced the bubble windows with sliding square ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of appellant's neighbors, Jeff Withrow and Carl A. Calvert, also testified regarding changes to the van, Calvert stating that appellant made drastic changes within days after Krista's death.  These neighbors described the vehicle as a maroon-colored Dodge van with white-lettered tires. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Warren Walfish, appellant's supervisor, testified that on the day Krista was kidnapped, appellant took three and one-half&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  hours leave from work in the afternoon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted on November 15, 1983 and charged with two counts of aggravated murder, with specifications, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> three counts of kidnapping, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and three counts of felonious sexual penetration. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To avoid potential prejudicial pretrial publicity, the Court of Common Pleas of Wayne County granted appellant's motion for change of venue on March 1, 1984.  A trial was held in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, ending April 4, 1984 with a jury verdict of guilty on all eight counts including the death penalty specifications. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

There was no showing that the witness suffered from a mental or physical impairment which affected the witness' ability to observe or recall events. Further, the court held that it was convinced that even if the hearsay testimony were to be eliminated from consideration, sufficient evidence would remain to constitute overwhelming proof of the defendant's guilt. The court found that the death sentence imposed was appropriate in light of the existence of the aggravating circumstances and the absence of any factors in mitigation of the crime. The sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. The court was convinced that defendant received objective, impartial, and unbiased review on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John W. Keefe, the relator, is a judge presently serving in the First District Court of Appeals.  Because of the impending expiration of his term, Judge Keefe, on October 2, 1985, filed a declaration of candidacy and a petition to have his name placed on the Democratic primary election ballot for May 6.  The Hamilton County Board of Elections, a respondent herein, refused to certify Judge Keefe's name for the reelection.  Respondents admit that Judge Keefe's petition was proper as to form and bore the requisite number of signatures.  Their refusal to submit Judge Keefe's name to the voters is based solely on the fact that Judge Keefe was born on April 24, 1915, making him seventy years old, and that he therefore will be unable to qualify for office under Section 6(C), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution.  That provision states in part: &quot;No person shall be elected or appointed to any judicial office if on or before the day when he shall assume the office and enter upon the discharge of its duties he shall have attained the age of seventy years.  * * *&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Keefe instituted the present action in mandamus, naming the Hamilton County Board of Elections, its&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  members, and Sherrod Brown, Secretary of State, as respondents.  In his complaint he alleges, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that Section 6(C), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, on its face and as applied to him, contravenes the Constitution of the United States and also is in conflict with other provisions of the Constitution of Ohio. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Because of the impending expiration of his term, the judge filed a declaration of candidacy and a petition to have his name placed on the primary election ballot. The county board of elections refused to submit his name to the voters because the judge was 70 years old and therefore did not qualify for office under Ohio Const. art. IV, &sect; 6(C). The judge asserted that &sect; 6(C) violated the United States Constitution. The court held that under the rational basis standard &sect; 6(C) was not invalid in view of the fact that there was no fundamental right to be a candidate for public office. The court could not find that the reasons given for mandatory retirement of judges were so irrational that they did not correspond with legitimate interests of the people of the state. Consequently, the court concluded that the judge could not establish a clear legal right to the relief he sought. It followed, then, that there was no duty whatsoever to certify his name for placement on the primary election ballot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees, Dale and Thelma Schwartz, owned and operated Shel-Mar Estates, a mobile home park in New Philadelphia, Ohio.  In July 1983, appellant, Kirk McAtee, moved into the park and received a copy of the park regulations.  One of the regulations prohibited possession by tenants of large-size dogs.  Appellant acquired a German shepherd dog and by notice dated May 2, 1984, Mrs. Schwartz notified appellant to have the dog removed from the park.  Appellant did not comply and on May 11, 1984, Mrs. Schwartz wrote to appellant advising him that his oral lease would be terminated as of June 20, 1984 and that appellant should remove his mobile home and all personal property from the park on or before that date. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 12, 1984, appellant, having not moved from the park, received from appellees a &quot;Notice To Leave The Premises.&quot; The notice stated: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are hereby notified that on or before July 15, 1984 you are to cause your mobile home to be moved from the premises * * *. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Grounds: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding over after termination of thirty (30) day oral lease</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Said termination being effective June 20, 1984, as provided for with&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  30 days notice in letter from owner's [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] to tenant dated May 11, 1984.  * * *&quot; (Emphasis added.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant remained in the park and on July 18, 1984, appellees filed a two-count complaint pursuant to R.C. Chapter 1923 (which deals with forcible entry and detainer actions) in the Municipal Court of New Philadelphia.  In the first count of the complaint, appellees alleged that appellant &quot;entered into a possession of * * * [the premises at Shel-Mar Estates] at a rental of Seventy-Six Dollars ($ 76.00) per month payable on the 1st day of each calendar month in advance; that on the 11th day of May, 1984, * * * [Shel-Mar Estates] served upon Defendant a 30 day notice to vacate the premises; that on the 12th day of July, 1984, * * * [Shel-Mar Estates] duly served upon * * * [appellant] as required by law a written notice to leave the premises within 3 days of said service. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore, * * * [appellant] now is unlawfully and forcibly detaining possession of said premises from * * * [Shel-Mar Estates] as a holdover tenant under Ohio Revised Code Sections 1923.02(A)(1), 3733.091(A)(3).&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second count of the complaint, appellees sought to recover damages&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  resulting from appellant's actions.  Appellees prayed for judgment which would restore the subject matter premises to their possession and for damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case went to trial on August 24, 1984.  At the conclusion of the trial, Shel-Mar's attorney moved to amend the complaint &quot;* * * to add * * * that * * * [appellant] has been requested to vacate the premises * * * for park rule violations.&quot; The record does not reflect that the trial court ever ruled on this motion.  On September 17, 1984, the municipal court ruled in favor of Shel-Mar and against appellant.  The court said: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * The plain meaning of Section 3733.091(A)(3) provides for a mobile home park operator to seek restitution of premises in forcible entry and detainer utilizing Chapter 1923, Ohio Revised Code, when a tenant is 'holding over his term.' * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this case it is clear that * * * [Shel-Mar has] complied with the provisions of Ohio law in notifying * * * [appellant] of * * * [its] intent to terminate the month-to-month tenancy.  There is no defect in notice and, as a consequence, the first claim of * * * [Shel-Mar] must be granted.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the court of appeals held that appellees&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  could successfully maintain an action in forcible entry and detainer even though their complaint failed to allege appellant had defaulted in the payment of his rent or breached the terms of his rental agreement.  The court finding its decision to be in conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeals for Lucas County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Allen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (July 2, 1981), No. L-80-388, unreported, certified the record of the case to this court for review and final determination.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The tenant had neither defaulted in payments of rent nor breached the terms of his oral rental agreement.

The landlords unilaterally terminated the lease nine days after giving the tenant a citation notice, which stated the tenant had two days to remove the dog. The court reversed the judgment. In so doing, the court held that (1) because the landlords failed to follow the procedure mandated by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3733.13, which provided that the tenant must have at least 30 days to remedy the noncompliance, they did not cause the tenant to become a holdover tenant, and (2) because there was no allegation in the landlords' complaint that the tenant defaulted in the payment of rent or breached a term of his rental agreement, the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 12, 1972, the City Commission of Dayton, Ohio passed an ordinance dealing with public-sector collective bargaining.  The ordinance provided that certain categories of employees, including &quot;supervisory employees,&quot; could not participate in the collective bargaining process.  It further provided that the city manager was responsible for &quot;* * * determining the appropriate representation unit * * *.&quot; On December 29, 1972, the city manager determined that all Dayton Police Department sergeants, lieutenants and captains and all lieutenants, captains and district chiefs of the Dayton Fire Department were &quot;supervisory employees&quot; within the meaning of the ordinance and excluded them from the bargaining unit represented by the Dayton Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 44 (&quot;FOP&quot;) and the International Association of Fire Fighters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FOP then filed a lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County challenging the validity of the ordinance and seeking a judicial determination of its rights.  On July 22, 1976, the court declared that the ordinance was valid in all respects, that police sergeants, lieutenants and captains were &quot;supervisory employees&quot; within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the meaning of the ordinance, and that the city manager had properly excluded them from the FOP representation unit. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 16, 1978, the court of appeals affirmed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1983, Ohio enacted the Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act, which is codified in R.C. Chapter 4117.  The Act, which took effect on April 1, 1984, created the State Employment Relations Board (&quot;SERB&quot;) ( R.C. 4117.02[A]) and provided that the SERB would be responsible for determining whether proposed employee bargaining units qualify as a bargaining unit under the terms of the Act ( R.C. 4117.06).  In addition, the Act broadly defines &quot;public employer,&quot; R.C. 4117.01(B), and &quot;public employee,&quot; R.C. 4117.01(C), but states that &quot;supervisors&quot; do not have collective bargaining rights under the Act, R.C. 4117.01(C)(10) and 4117.03. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;R.C. 4117.01(F) defines &quot;supervisor&quot;: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Supervisor' means any individual&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  who has authority, in the interest of the public employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other public employees; to responsibly direct them; to adjust their grievances; or to effectively recommend such action, if the exercise of that authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature but requires the use of independent judgment * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broad sweep of this definition is substantially narrowed by R.C. 4117.01(F)(2): </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With respect to members of a police or fire department, no person shall be deemed a supervisor except the chief of the department or those individuals who, in the absence of the chief, are authorized to exercise the authority and perform the duties of the chief of the department.  Where prior to June 1, 1982, a public employer pursuant to a judicial decision rendered in litigation to which the public employer was a party, has declined to engage in collective bargaining with members of a police or fire department on the basis that such members are supervisors, those members of a police or fire department do not have the rights specified in Chapter 4117 of the Revised Code for the purposes of future&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  collective bargaining.  * * *&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second sentence of R.C. 4117.01(F)(2) is the so-called &quot;Dayton Amendment,&quot; and is the subject of this lawsuit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On or about April 4, 1984, the FOP filed a Request for Voluntary Recognition as a bargaining unit with the SERB.  A copy of the request was served on the city of Dayton.  The request described the proposed bargaining unit as, &quot;[s]worn supervisors of [the] Dayton Police Department holding the ranks of Sergeant, Lieutenant and Captain.&quot; The request was assigned case No. 84-VR-04-0231.  By a letter dated May 29, 1984, the Mayor of Dayton wrote to the SERB, stating in part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you are well aware, supervisors in Dayton's city government are treated differently, under state law, than supervisors in uniformed services in other communities.  * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The so-called 'Dayton Amendment' to the new State Collective Bargaining Law is thought, by some, to be unconstitutional in that Dayton's uniformed supervisors are addressed differently than those in all other Ohio cities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are seeking direction and decision from the members of the State Employment Relations Board.  * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * [I]t would only seem fair if supervisory employees around&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the state were treated as are Dayton's employees, or, in the alternative, Dayton's employees were treated as all others -- in other words, the law should probably apply one way or the other, equally across the state of Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are, therefore, requesting that this case be used as a vehicle for obtaining a formal, legal opinion as to the constitutionality of the 'Dayton Amendment' to the State Collective Bargaining Law.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 31, 1984, the city of Dayton filed a motion to dismiss the FOP Request for Voluntary Recognition on the ground that the bargaining unit proposed by the FOP consisted of persons who are not &quot;public employees&quot; under the Act and thus &quot;* * * do not have the rights specified in Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code for purposes of collective bargaining, because prior to June 1, 1982 * * * [the city] declined to engage in collective bargaining with such [police department] members pursuant to judicial decisions in litigation to which the * * * [city] was a party.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 14, 1984, a SERB hearing officer issued a proposed order recommending that the city's motion to dismiss be granted.  He noted that Dayton's Mayor had requested that the board determine the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutionality of the &quot;Dayton Amendment,&quot; but concluded that since the SERB was an administrative agency, and not a court, it had no authority to make such a determination.  He went on to find that Dayton Police Department sergeants, lieutenants and captains did not have the right to engage in collective bargaining, &quot;* * * in that they were determined to be supervisors under the terms of * * * [the relevant Dayton ordinance] pursuant to a judicial decision rendered in litigation to which the public employer was a party prior to June 1, 1982.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FOP filed exceptions to the proposed order with the entire board.  On November 21, 1984, the board issued an opinion in effect accepting the hearing officer's recommendations.  The board found that the &quot;* * * [Dayton Amendment] was intended to apply, and does apply, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">exclusively to the Dayton Police Department</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; (emphasis added), and that &quot;[i]t is conceivable * * * that the uniquely exclusive specificity of the 'judicial decision' exemption offends the equal protection provisions of the Ohio Constitution and the equal protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.&quot; (Footnotes omitted.) The board&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  concluded that since it was a part of the executive branch of government, it had no authority to declare the &quot;Dayton Amendment&quot; unconstitutional, and that such a determination could only be made by the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 25, 1985, relator, the FOP, filed a complaint in this court seeking a writ of mandamus to require the SERB to reinstate case No. 84-VR-04-0231, and to rule on it in accordance with the law.  Relator further requested this court to declare the &quot;Dayton Amendment&quot; unconstitutional.  The city of Dayton and the SERB were named as respondents.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of July 21, 1983, appellant, Earline Martin, shot to death her husband, sixty-eight-year-old Walter C. Martin, Sr., after an argument over grocery money.  Appellant was arrested and charged with aggravated murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.01. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant pleaded not guilty and, at trial, raised the affirmative defense of self-defense.  Appellant took the stand and testified she feared for her life because the victim had struck her just prior to the fatal shooting.  In closing argument, the prosecutor characterized appellant's testimony as a sham, amounting to a lie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant requested and received jury instructions on self-defense.  At the close of evidence and argument, the trial judge instructed the jury on the offense of aggravated murder and the lesser-included offenses of murder and voluntary manslaughter.  The trial court instructed the jury that it should not consider any lesser-included offense if the jury first found that the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the offense of aggravated murder.  The trial court's charge included the following: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically speaking, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  look at the aggravated murder first.  If you find the Defendant not guilty, then you go to murder.  In the event that you deliberate as to murder, and making a good faith effort, you are unable to reach a verdict, then you go to the next step, the same thing, going on to voluntary manslaughter.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury found appellant guilty of aggravated murder with a gun specification, and the court sentenced her to life and a three-year term of imprisonment.  On appeal, appellant claimed five assignments of error.  First, appellant contended that the state unconstitutionally imposed upon her the burden of proving self-defense and that this, in effect, required her to prove her innocence.  Second and third, appellant claimed she was denied due process of law when the trial court instructed the jury not to consider the lesser-included offenses unless and until it had reached a conclusion regarding the aggravated murder offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed an order of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which affirmed her conviction for aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01. At trial she had asserted self-defense. On appeal, she contended that because self-defense negated the mens rea of aggravated murder, requiring her to prove self-defense compelled her to prove her innocence by disproving criminal intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant shot to death her 68-year-old husband. At trial, she asserted self-defense, testifying that she feared for her life because the victim had struck her just prior to the fatal shooting. The jury found her guilty. On appeal, she claimed that because it was constitutionally impermissible to require her to prove her innocence, once she produced evidence of self-defense, the prosecution had to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. The court disagreed and affirmed, holding that &sect; 2901.05 required the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of a homicide offense as defined by statute, and the statute did not require defendant to disprove any essential element of the offense. Thus, she had to prove self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Self-defense involved facts peculiarly within her knowledge. The burden of proving it by a preponderance of the evidence did not require her to prove her innocence by disproving an element of the charged offense. Also, there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. The husband had been visibly weakened as the result of a heart attack and stroke, which he suffered two months prior to the killing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arises from the court of appeals' reversal of the conviction of Hank Williams, appellee, on two counts of rape.  The court of appeals remanded the case to allow certain testimonial evidence proffered by appellee to be admitted at trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events which led to the indictment of appellee occurred on September 27, 1983.  Tracy Washington, the alleged victim, testified at trial that on the day in question she was raped by appellee after refusing to pay money on a claimed debt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a pretrial hearing held pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(E), appellee admitted the sexual intercourse with the alleged victim on the date in question, but claimed it was consensual.  He testified as to having had numerous prior sexual encounters with the alleged victim.  Further, appellee testified that the alleged victim was a prostitute, and that he was her &quot;pimp.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the pretrial hearing, defense witness James Hart testified on direct examination as to the alleged victim's reputation in the community as a prostitute.  The trial judge ruled that this evidence would be inadmissible at trial, pursuant to R.C. 2907.02. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, Ms. Washington&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  testified on direct examination that she had not had sex with appellee prior to September 27, 1983, and that she did not have sex with men because she was &quot;gay.&quot; During cross-examination by the defense, the following colloquy took place: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q.  [Defense attorney] All right, and you consider yourself as a person who likes females, rather than males, in your sexual orientation, which is towards other females; is that correct? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A.  [Ms. Washington] That's correct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Q.  All right.  You offer this as a basis for the proposition that you would therefore not voluntarily have sex or intercourse or other sexual relations with a male person; is that the reason you offer it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A.  That is right.&quot; (Bracketed material added.) Later, during the trial, defense witness John Fleming, Jr. attempted to testify on direct examination as to his prior sexual relations with the alleged victim.  This evidence was objected to by the state, the appellant herein, and stricken from the record. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee then proffered the pretrial testimony of James Hart as to the reputation of the alleged victim, as well as the testimony of Fleming, concerning his prior sexual activity with her and her reputation as&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a prostitute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee was convicted on the two counts of rape and sentenced to two concurrent terms of ten to twenty-five years' imprisonment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals reversed.  The case was remanded in order that the testimony of defense witnesses Hart and Fleming be admitted into evidence. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state sought review from an order of the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio), which reversed a conviction of appellee for two counts of rape and which remanded the case to allow certain testimonial evidence proffered by appellee to be admitted at trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The state charged appellee with two counts of rape, and during a pretrial hearing, the trial court ruled that various evidence and testimony concerning the victim's reputation in the community as a prostitute was inadmissible, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(D). Appellee was convicted of two counts of rape and sought review. The appellate court reversed the convictions and remanded to the trial court for the admission of the evidence. The state sought review of that order, and the court affirmed the appellate court's ruling, holding that the evidence sought to be admitted was probative of the contested issue in this case as to whether the victim had consented, which related to a direct element of the crime. The court found that the probative value of the testimony outweighed any interest the state had in exclusion. Further, that exclusion of the evidence was a violation of appellee's U.S. Const. amend. VI right of confrontation. The court also held that Ohio R. Evid. 608(B) did not preclude admissibility of the proffered evidence because it was offered for more than mere impeachment of credibility.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arises from a decision of the court of appeals approving a final schedule of assessments made by the board of county commissioners for a ditch improvement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, this ditch improvement was petitioned by landowners in the Morrison Ditch watershed area of Seneca County.  At the time of the petition, that portion of the ditch upon the lands of Floyd and Rita Meyers, appellants herein, was virtually obliterated and had been cultivated and planted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Seneca County Engineer calculated the assessments for the ditch improvement, applying the so-called &quot;Preble County&quot; formula, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and submitted his report to the Board of County Commissioners of Seneca County, appellees herein, in January 1981.  Many of the landowners, including appellants, hired a private excavator to make improvements in an effort to reduce the assessments. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The &quot;Preble County&quot; formula is a complex and detailed series of calculations involving numerous factors and was first published by the County Engineer of Preble County.  Yost, Rational Determination of County Ditch Assessments, Ohio County Engineers News (Nov. 1979). In the instant case, the elements used in the calculations of this formula were adapted to the peculiarities of Seneca County in determining appellants' assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These landowners appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Seneca County which ordered the county engineer to make a second assessment taking into account the excavation work.  The excavations, however, proved insufficient and the second schedule of assessments was not significantly lower than the first.  Appellees then approved the new assessments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellants, who owned approximately ten percent of the affected acreage, were assessed approximately thirty-six percent of the total project cost.  They again appealed to the common pleas court, claiming their assessments were unconstitutionally disproportionate to the benefits which they received.  Appellants also contended that the formula used to calculate the assessments did not properly determine benefits as required by R.C. 6131.15 and 6131.01. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">de novo,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law approving the assessments and specifically approving the &quot;Preble County&quot; formula as a reasonable method of determining benefits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, appellants again attacked the formula used to calculate assessments and again claimed that their assessments were unconstitutionally disproportionate to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the benefits received.  Appellants also contended that the trial court erred in placing the burden of proof upon them at the trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Appellees argued that the formula used to calculate the assessments was valid and that appellants' assessments were not disproportionate.  Appellees further argued that the burden of proof was properly upon appellants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, reasoning that the factors used in the &quot;Preble County&quot; formula were consistent with &quot;benefits&quot; as defined by R.C. 6131.15 and 6131.01.  The court of appeals further held that appellants had not sustained their burden of proof in showing disproportionate assessments, as their lands had most needed the ditch improvement and received the greatest benefits thereby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

The county engineer calculated the assessments for the improvement, applying the so-called &quot;Preble County&quot; formula. After a second assessment was made, the board approved the assessments.

They appealed to the trial court, claiming their assessments were unconstitutionally disproportionate to the benefits that they received and that the formula used to calculate the assessments did not properly determine benefits as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 6131.15, 6131.01. The trial court approved the assessments and the formula used. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment. The landowners appealed, but the court affirmed and found that the use of the &quot;Preble County&quot; formula gave a rational and justifiable basis to the calculation of the assessments and demonstrated an assessment in which the landowners' greater need was proportionate to their greater benefits from the improvement. The burden was properly upon the landowners to demonstrate the unlawfulness of the assessments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 30, 1983 at approximately 7:50 a.m., appellant, David Mapes, and Rodney Newton entered Chap's Bar located on Prospect Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio.  The bar was closed, but one of its owners, John Allen, and four employees were present.  Allen, Ronald Rucci and Michael Williams were seated at the bar.  John Hovekamp and David Yun were off to the side in a section of the bar known as the &quot;pit area,&quot; asleep.  A sixth man, Frank Kuhn, was upstairs in the building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mapes and Newton gained entrance through the rear of the building and, upon encountering the three men at the bar, Mapes aimed a sawed-off shotgun he was carrying at Rucci's head and instructed all three to put their hands on the bar.  Allen began to make some gesture with his hands and Mapes shot him in the face.  Allen fell to the floor, mortally wounded.  At the sound of the shot, Rucci dove to the floor.  Mapes ordered Williams to lie on the floor and then searched the men on the floor, including Allen, for money.  Newton went first behind the bar to the cash register, and then proceeded to the video machines.  While en route to the video machines, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Newton spotted Yun and Hovekamp in the &quot;pit area&quot; and notified Mapes of their presence.  Mapes ordered Rucci and Williams to crawl to the &quot;pit area&quot; and stood guard over the four there while Newton broke into the video games with a crowbar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mapes and Newton next proceeded to the back of the building where the safe was located and the liquor was stored.  The two were not able to open the safe as Allen had been the only one present who knew the combination.  The four men then heard a door slam and, after determining it was safe, called the police.  Allen was dead when the police arrived at 8:10 a.m. The police found no one at the scene but found a broken window by the parking lot of the Town House Apartments and a garage door held open by a wooden block. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Reese, upon hearing the news accounts of the murder and robbery, notified a Cleveland detective that Mapes had approached him and had attempted to recruit him for the robbery of Chap's Bar.  Reese gave the police a formal written statement to this effect on February 5, 1983.  On February 6, the police showed a photo array to John Hovekamp.  He selected photos of three individuals whom he thought resembled the gunman.  This&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  group included a photo of appellant.  On the next day, a warrant for appellant's arrest and a warrant to search his apartment were obtained.  This search, conducted on February 8, 1983, revealed, among other things, a crowbar.  Appellant was arrested and, when questioned, he told the police that he had merely prepared an entrance to the bar, but that Newton and a man named Red had committed the robbery.  On February 11, 1983, a lineup was held at which Hovekamp positively identified appellant as the man carrying the shotgun within the premises where the robbery and murder occurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newton was arrested on March 4, 1983 in Akron and was interviewed by Cleveland police on March 7.  He gave a full written statement to police recounting the events at the bar consistent with the accounts of the bar employees and the police investigation.  This written statement was introduced at trial and Newton testified at trial.  Newton also indicated that appellant had returned to his own apartment and dropped unused shells down a drainpipe and arranged to dispose of the gun.  After obtaining a warrant, the police found a shell in the hole indicated by Newton.  The shell was the same type that was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  used to kill Allen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rucci positively identified appellant during trial as the man who shot Allen with the sawed-off shotgun.  Hayward Chambers testified at trial that appellant had admitted to him that he had robbed Chaps and killed Allen.  Appellant's wife and a neighbor, Christine Alexander, both testified that appellant owned a sawed-off shotgun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted for two counts of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(B).  One count charged that the murder occurred during the course of an aggravated robbery.  The other count charged that the murder occurred during the course of an aggravated burglary.  Each of these counts had four identical specifications as follows: Under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), one death-penalty specification alleging the offense occurred in the course of an aggravated robbery; under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), one death-penalty specification alleging the offense occurred in the course of an aggravated burglary; under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), one death-penalty specification alleging a prior murder conviction; and, under R.C. 2941.141, one firearm specification.  In addition to the death-penalty charges, Counts Three, Four and Five each charged aggravated robbery under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  R.C. 2911.01, and Count Six charged aggravated burglary under R.C. 2911.11. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury returned a verdict finding appellant guilty of both counts of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(B), but not guilty of the death-penalty specifications charged under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).  Appellant was found guilty of the firearm specification as well as Counts Four, Five and Six.  Appellant was found not guilty of Count Three. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of whether appellant was guilty of the prior murder specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) was tried separately to the court.  The court received into evidence an indictment from Passaic County, New Jersey, charging appellant with murder.  Also received was a judgment of conviction entered upon appellant's plea of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">non vult</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  The court found appellant guilty of the prior murder specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the sentencing phase of trial, appellant made a statement on his own behalf, but presented no other witnesses.  The jury returned a recommendation that the death penalty be imposed.  The trial court sentenced appellant to death on the two counts of aggravated murder and to terms of imprisonment on Counts Four, Five and Six, to run consecutively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court of appeals merged the conviction for aggravated murder with specifications under Count Two of the indictment with the conviction under Count One because only one homicide occurred.  The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction and the various sentences imposed by the trial court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.  </SPAN></P>

Crim. P. 11, Ohio R. Evid. 410, appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) affirming a trial court judgment convicting defendant of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, and a firearm specification, and sentencing him to death, for robbing a bar and fatally shooting its owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant argued on appeal that his foreign state conviction on a non vult plea was inadmissible to prove a prior murder specification, that the &quot;death-qualification&quot; of each juror should have been made separately, and that he was denied his right to remain silent by the prosecutor's comment on his unsworn statement during the sentencing phase. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that admission of a conviction entered upon a no contest plea to prove a prior murder specification was not precluded by Ohio R. Crim. P. 11 or Ohio R. Evid. 410. The court stated that the determination of whether voir dire in a capital case should be conducted in sequestration was a matter of discretion within the province of the trial judge. The court observed that because the jury had to determine the weight attributed to defendant's unsworn oral statement, the state could dispute the weight of that statement without violating defendant's Fifth Amendment rights. The court concluded that the mitigating factors did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances and that the sentence of capital punishment was neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, William E. Calhoun, was indicted on one count of voluntary manslaughter in violation of former R.C. 2903.03. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appellee entered a plea of not guilty.  A jury trial commenced on October 18, 1982.  After the jury had been impanelled and sworn, and following opening statements and the testimony of two witnesses for the state, the trial court called counsel into chambers, where the following discussion and decision transpired: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE COURT: Let the record show we are in chambers.  It is now 11:30, and we have been discussing a problem since nine-thirty this morning, and we have arrived at the situation which is as follows: &quot;The Prosecutor will state that their [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] evidence will not establish that the defendant while under extreme emotional stress brought on by serious provocation reasonably sufficient to incite him into using deadly force caused the death of another, and that the defendant's position is equally that his client was not under extreme emotional stress brought on by serious provocation reasonably sufficient to incite him into using deadly force.  Is that correct? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. HENSLEY [defense attorney]: &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's correct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE COURT: And that is your agreement? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. GOELZ [prosecutor]: That is our agreement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE COURT: The state of the record being as it is and after a prolonged discussion of the impact of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Solomon,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 66 O.S. 2d 214, 20 O.O. 3d 213, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Muscatello,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 55 O.S. 2d 201, 9 O.O. 3d 148, the first syllabus of which reads as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Extreme emotional stress, as described in R.C. Sec. 2903.03, is not an element of the crime of voluntary manslaughter.' [T]his Court's view is that a normal interpretation of the statute under the rules of construction would make this a necessary element to be proved by the Prosecutor.  The impact of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Muscatello</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to indicate that this is not an element, which renders the statute vague and uncertain as not informing the defendant precisely with what he is charged, and is therefore unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. GOELZ: You want to in your entry get that langue [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> language] in, and after the holding of the Court that the statute is unconstitutional, you will want to dismiss the indictment against the defendant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. HENSLEY: I don't think you should go that far. &quot;(Further discussion, off the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  record) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE COURT: Therefore, the Court dismisses the indictment.  You prepare an entry and submit it to Jim [defense attorney] for approval. &quot;There's no point in bringing the jury back, is there? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. GOELZ: Not unless you want to advise them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE COURT: I'll go back to the jury room and tell them, if that's all right with you. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MR. GOELZ: That's all right. &quot;(Court was then adjourned).&quot; <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;This section was amended effective May 19, 1982.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state then appealed this dismissal of the indictment.  The court of appeals, in a decision rendered on April 18, 1983, found that R.C. 2903.03 was not unconstitutionally vague and thus reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.  This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and on September 14, 1983, this court overruled the motion for leave to appeal (case No. 83-948). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 12, 1984, appellee was again brought before the trial court for arraignment on the same charges and same indictment. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A plea of not guilty was entered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee then filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that he had previously been placed in jeopardy for the same charge and on the same indictment.  The court, in granting the motion, first determined that the dismissal of the indictment was on the judge's own motion and that the termination of the trial was against the desire of the appellee.  The court then held that there was no manifest necessity to dismiss the indictment and that to retry the appellee at this time would violate the appellee's right not to be placed twice in jeopardy.  The court reasoned that &quot;[i]f the trial judge had allowed the trial to continue to its conclusion, and applied the prosecutor's interpretation of the statute, then the defendant's [appellee's] right to have his case determined by a 'particular tribunal' would have been protected.  If the jury had returned a conviction, the judge could still have found that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and arrested the judgment pursuant to Rule 34 of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure. This decision could have been appealed by the State, and if the appeals court then found that the statute was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  constitutional, and not vague, could have reinstated the jury conviction.  This procedure or approach would have protected the defendant's [appellee's] rights as well as allowed for a determination of the validity of the statute.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the decision of the trial court was affirmed, the court of appeals stating that it agreed &quot;with the trial court that jeopardy attached, and * * * that * * * [it adopted the trial] court's well reasoned opinion as rationale for * * * [its] holding.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County (Ohio), which held that double jeopardy had attached to appellee's indictment for voluntary manslaughter. The appellate court held that the dismissal of appellee's first indictment was on the trial judge's own motion and that the termination of the first trial, following opening statements and the testimony of two state witnesses, was not of appellee's wishes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, the issue was whether a subsequent retrial of a criminal defendant based on the same indictment was barred by double jeopardy where the trial judge sua sponte ruled midtrial that the statute upon which the indictment was based, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.03, was unconstitutionally vague and then terminated the proceedings. The court held that the trial court's reasoning for terminating the proceedings was not premised upon the insufficiency of the prosecutor's evidence. The court reasoned that the jury had neither found appellee guilty nor voted for his acquittal. The court held that both appellee and the state were entitled to have one complete trial which terminated in a verdict on a finding that the state's case was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction. The court reversed the appellate court's judgment and held that double jeopardy did not bar retrial where the trial judge ruled midtrial that &sect; 2903.03, upon which the indictment was based, was unconstitutionally vague and dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment, which held that retrial of appellee was barred by the doctrine of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator, Fred Stecker Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., is a Delaware corporation qualified to conduct business in Ohio.  At present, relator is a party to an agreement with Ford Motor Company, Lincoln-Mercury Division (hereinafter &quot;Ford&quot;), whereby relator is to operate a retail automobile dealership for the sale of new Lincoln and Mercury automobiles at a proposed facility in Orange Village, Ohio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1983, Ford, pursuant to R.C. 4517.50, notified the Motor Vehicle Dealers Board (hereinafter &quot;Dealers Board&quot;), a respondent herein, as well as other Lincoln-Mercury dealers in the relevant market area, of its intention to establish the new dealership.  As permitted by R.C. 4517.50, three existing Lincoln-Mercury dealers filed protests to Ford's franchise proposal.  After a lengthy hearing on the protests, the hearing examiner for the Dealers Board issued a recommendation to partially uphold the protests of the existing dealers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an appeal of the hearing examiner's recommendation, the Dealers Board ruled in Ford's favor and denied the protests in a two-to-one decision dated March 30, 1984.  Relator then applied to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles (hereinafter&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Registrar&quot;), also a respondent herein, for a dealership license in accordance with R.C. 4517.02 and 4517.04.  The facility passed inspection and was assigned a permit number; however, prior to the issuance of the dealership license by the Registrar, the protestants sought reconsideration of the March 1984 decision of the Dealers Board.  One of the members of the March 30, 1984 panel had by this time resigned, and the dissenter to the original decision, David Mainwaring, participated as a member of the reconstituted board which granted, on April 16, 1984, the request for reconsideration.  On April 27, 1984, the reconstituted board reversed its earlier decision and issued a new order upholding the protests, thus denying the establishment of the proposed franchise.  From this decision Ford instituted an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County in accordance with R.C. 119.12. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

The court denied the retailer's request for a writ of mandamus to compel issuance of the license.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees and cross-appellants, Marilyn Cramer, Clerk of the Crawford County Municipal Court, and Judge John F. Bender, Judge of the Crawford County Municipal Court (hereinafter &quot;appellees&quot;), submitted a budgetary request for the 1984 municipal court employee salary appropriation in the amount of $ 110,000 to appellants and cross-appellees, the Crawford County Board of County Commissioners and its individual members (hereinafter &quot;appellants&quot;).  On March 7, 1984, appellees subsequently adjusted their request to an appropriation of $ 95,000 for municipal court employee salaries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants approved $ 81,625 for municipal court employee salaries for 1984.  Appellees rejected appellants' appropriation.  On March 20, 1984, appellants notified Judge Bender that no payroll vouchers would be signed and that no paychecks would be issued on March 23, 1984, until the appropriation dispute was resolved.  On March 23, appellees filed a complaint in mandamus in the court of appeals seeking to compel appellants to grant the requested appropriation.  On March 27, 1984, the court of appeals entered judgment denying&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  appellees' complaint for mandamus.  However, on March 30, the court of appeals set aside this judgment and issued an order directing appellants to approve and sign the payroll vouchers of the court employees and to approve appellees' appropriation request, or to show cause why they had not done so at a hearing to be held on April 16, 1984. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 16, the court of appeals held the scheduled hearing.  Subsequently, the court, on June 19, 1984, ordered that the requested appropriation be approved, with the exception that the amount of the requested increase contained therein for the salary of appellee Marilyn Cramer, which was over the amount fixed for that position by appellants, be deleted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 29, 1984, appellants filed a motion to stay the order of the court of appeals pending further appeal.

However, Ohio Rev.

Municipal judges had wide latitude in prescribing particular duties of deputy clerks. The board failed to show an abuse of discretion. The municipal court properly appointed and set the salary of a bailiff who performed duties as a probation officer. The clerk's rate of compensation properly rested in the board. Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1981, appellees, Carmen Jean Johnson, Christopher Denver Johnson, and the Washington County Welfare Department, filed an action for necessaries against the appellant herein, George Denver Adams.  The appellees alleged that the appellant was the natural father of Christopher Johnson (who was born on September 27, 1980), and sought judgment for expenses incurred on Christopher's behalf, an order for support, and a declaration of paternity.  In a deposition taken during discovery, Carmen Johnson (Christopher's natural mother) stated that she had had sexual intercourse with the appellant during November and December 1979 and January 1980.  She also stated that (1) she had married another man, Robert Glen Riggle (her sister's husband's brother), on May 19, 1980, (2) Riggle was aware that she was pregnant at the time of their marriage, (3) she had &quot;seen&quot; Riggle for only one week prior to their marriage, and (4) she and Riggle separated one week after their marriage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams did not deny that he had had sexual intercourse with Carmen Johnson in November and December 1979 and January 1980, but he filed a motion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for summary judgment on the grounds that Riggle, under the common law of Ohio, was conclusively presumed to be the father of Christopher Johnson.  In support of this motion, the appellant cited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hall </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Rosen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 135 [4 O.O.3d 135], which held: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biological father of a child can not be held for its support where the mother, during pregnancy, contracts marriage with another man, who marries her with full knowledge of her condition and thereby consents to stand in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">loco parentis</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to such child and to being the father of the child.  ( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Miller </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8"> Anderson,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 43 Ohio St. 473, approved and followed.)&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1983, the court of appeals reversed the trial court by holding, first, that R.C. Chapter 3111, as effective on June 29, 1982, was a &quot;legislative reversal&quot; of the conclusive presumption of paternity set forth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hall</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, second, that the amended terms of R.C.

Chapter 3111 could not be applied retroactively to the appellee's action, wherein judgment was entered prior to the effective date of amended R.C. Chapter 3111.  The appellate court granted appellant's motion for reconsideration and vacated its original decision; but, in its second decision, the court again reversed the trial court by distinguishing the facts of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hall</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from those of the instant case </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and remanding the cause for consideration of evidence to rebut the presumption that Riggle was the natural father of Christopher Johnson. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mother asserted that she had had sexual intercourse with the alleged father, and then had married another man and that other man was aware that she was pregnant at the time of their marriage. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the alleged father on the ground that under the common law of Ohio, the mother's husband was conclusively presumed to have been the father. The court first held that &sect; 3111 had no application to paternity actions in which judgment was entered prior to its enactment date because the statute was not retrospective. The court decided that the presumption of paternity in cases in which a man married a woman with knowledge that she was pregnant did not apply. The &quot;common-sense&quot; approach prevented the court from transforming the husband's relationship with a pregnant mother into a commitment to provide support for the child. The policy concerns behind the rebuttable presumption of paternity were legitimate. The court concluded that although the rebuttable presumption in &sect; 3111 was not applicable, the rationale warranted its application in other paternity actions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 22, 1983, at approximately 11:50 p.m., appellee, Leo R. Earlenbaugh, was operating a semi-tractor-trailer on northbound Interstate 71.  At that time, Trooper Joe L. Anderson of the Ohio Highway Patrol had stopped to assist Trooper Harvey on a routine traffic matter.  Anderson's cruiser was positioned behind Harvey's cruiser and was off the traveled portion of the highway some one and one-half feet from the solid white edge or berm line of northbound I-71.  Both cruisers had their lights and flashers activated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Anderson was standing beside Harvey's cruiser, between that cruiser and the berm line of the northbound I-71 lanes, the appellee approached the parked vehicles in his semi-tractor-trailer.  Anderson testified that appellee's rig began moving closer to the right edge of the lane nearest the berm.  In order to avoid the oncoming rig, Anderson positioned himself flatly up against Harvey's cruiser.  Anderson further testified that the appellee deliberately passed over the berm line with his tractor-trailer, to within six inches of Anderson and his cruiser, &quot;in an apparent attempt to see how close he could&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  get to me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellee testified that he reduced his speed when he saw Anderson and the stopped vehicles.  He agreed that Anderson positioned himself closely against Harvey's cruiser, but contended that he did not cross over the berm line with any portion of his truck. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson then pursued the appellee for some four to five minutes, over a distance of six to seven miles, stopped him, and charged him with reckless operation in violation of R.C. 4511.20. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wadsworth Municipal Court found that appellee's rig crossed over the white berm line and passed within six inches of Anderson.  The court concluded that &quot;the act of crossing the line was in wanton disregard of the safety of Trooper Anderson and his vehicle&quot; in contravention of R.C. 4511.20.  The court made no finding that appellee was guilty of willful misconduct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal to the Court of Appeals for Medina County, the appellee raised the following assignment of error: &quot;The trial court erred in finding the defendant guilty of reckless operation in violation of section 4511.20 of the Ohio Revised Code in that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  court of appeals, while purporting to address the assigned error, held essentially that R.C. 4511.20 was unconstitutionally defective as applied to the facts of this case, and reversed.  The court based this determination upon its conclusion that &quot;[a]s the trial court herein was unable to find the defendant guilty of willful disregard, it follows he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of willful disregard of another's safety.&quot; The court of appeals, however, did not evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's finding that the appellee acted in wanton disregard of the safety of Trooper Anderson. </SPAN></P>

Thus, the court held that neither the terminology nor the application of &sect; 4511.20 was violative of defendant's right to equal protection of the laws.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, William F. Reeder, was involved in an altercation with a customer at appellee's workplace, the Allen County Humane Center.  The customer went to the center to obtain a refund for an animal which had died shortly after it was purchased there.  An argument ensued and appellee jabbed and pushed the customer, used abusive language, and threatened to send him to jail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A complaint was filed which alleged disorderly conduct by appellee.  Upon consideration of the evidence, the trial court found appellee guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of R.C. 2917.11(A)(1).

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals held that R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) is unconstitutionally vague in that its use of the words &quot;turbulent behavior&quot; does not sufficiently define the prohibited conduct.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from the reversal of appellee's conviction of two counts of aggravated robbery.  A divided court of appeals held that the trial court's refusal to permit the presentation of alibi testimony on the grounds that the appellee had failed to comply with Crim. R. 12.1 was a violation of appellee's constitutional rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  The concurring judge found that defense counsel's failure to comply with the rule as noted above was a violation of defendant's rights in that he was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel and that the exclusion of the alibi testimony was an abuse of the trial court's discretion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James N. Winston, Jr. and his brother, Lloyd E. Winston, were robbed by two men at gunpoint at approximately 12:45 a.m. on April 13, 1982.  The assailants then forced their way into the Winston automobile and the four men drove away from the scene of the crime.  Shortly thereafter, the Winstons were ordered out of the car.  They then reported the crime to the police and gave a description of the stolen&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  vehicle.  Between 1:00 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. on the same night, Cleveland police officers Edward Starks and Leon Goodlow followed an automobile matching the description of the Winston vehicle.  A chase ensued and the suspects lost control of the car, which crashed into a nearby house.  After both men jumped out of the vehicle, the driver fired one shot at Officer Starks, and then fled.  The suspects escaped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 20, 1982, James Winston entered a gameroom on Cleveland's east side and spotted one of the men who had robbed him.  Winston immediately informed the police and took them to the gameroom where he identified the appellee as his assailant.  Winston later identified the appellee, Norman W. Smith, at a formal police lineup.  At this time, Officer Starks also identified the appellee as both the driver of the stolen vehicle and the man who had shot at him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter proceeded to trial.  After the state had rested, counsel for the appellee announced his intention to call his client and other alibi witnesses, to establish that Smith was elsewhere at the time of the offense.  Counsel had not filed a notice of alibi pursuant to Crim. R. 12.1, nor had he informed the prosecution&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of his planned use of an alibi defense.  The trial court ruled that the appellee would not be permitted to testify as to his alibi, and that he could not call any alibi witnesses.  The appellee was convicted of two counts of aggravated robbery, and the judgment of conviction was reversed upon appeal. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with two counts of aggravated robbery. At trial, defendant was precluded from testifying as to an alibi because his counsel failed to file a notice of alibi as required under Ohio R. Crim. P. 12.1. Defendant was convicted. The appellate court reversed the convictions, finding that the refusal to permit the alibi testimony violated defendant's constitutional rights. The State appealed, and the court reversed the appellate court's judgment. Defense counsel's failure to timely file a notice of alibi did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel's noncompliance with Rule 12.1 was a trial tactic. As such, the common-sense enforcement of the notice of alibi rule, by the preclusion of defendant's testimony, did not violate his constitutional right to testify. That defendant was limited in his testimony was the result of his own failure to comply with the rules. Likewise, enforcement of Rule 12.1 did not violate defendant's right to compulsory process, as the rule did not prevent the issuance of process for witnesses. The State was unaware of the identity of the alibi witnesses, and it would have been prejudiced by the introduction of alibi testimony.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intervening respondent, Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund (hereinafter &quot;ODGF&quot;), is a mutual deposit guaranty association incorporated pursuant to R.C. 1151.80 to 1151.92, inclusive, for the purpose of providing liquidity to its members and to guarantee the deposits in member savings and loan associations.  ODGF is the only mutual deposit guaranty association in Ohio and was incorporated with Ohio's state chartered savings and loan associations as its members. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its largest member is Home State Savings Bank, holding approximately $ 525 million in deposits.  In March 1985, Home State Savings Bank failed and was unable to meet the demands of its depositors.  It closed on March 9, 1985 and has not reopened. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the closing of Home State Savings Bank, it was feared that public confidence in state-chartered savings and loan associations would falter and in order to prevent mass withdrawals from other state-chartered savings and loan associations, emergency measures were undertaken. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 13, 1985, Sub. S. B. No. 113 was enacted effective immediately as an emergency measure.  It was passed with thirty-one affirmative votes and one negative vote in the Ohio&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senate (Senate Journal, Wednesday, March 13, 1985, at 121) and with seventy-three affirmative votes and fourteen negative votes in the Ohio House of Representatives (House Journal, Wednesday, March 13, 1985, at 255).  The Senate Journal for March 13, 1985 reflects that a motion was &quot;agreed to&quot; to suspend the three-day reading requirement.  (Senate Journal, Wednesday, March 13, 1985, at 119.) The House Journal also reflects a vote on March 13, 1985 to suspend the three-day rule and immediately consider Sub. S. B. No. 113.  (House Journal, Wednesday, March 13, 1985, at 254.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sub. S. B. No. 113 amended R.C. 1151.01 to provide that a deposit guaranty association organized under R.C. 1151.81 to 1151.92 was included within the definition of &quot;building and loan association&quot; as that term was defined in R.C. Chapter 1157.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effect of that amendment was to allow the Superintendent of Savings and Loan Associations to appoint a conservator over a deposit guaranty association or liquidate a deposit guaranty association as formerly authorized only against savings and loan associations.  Formerly, no statutes existed authorizing comparable overseeing or takeover powers with respect to a deposit&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  guaranty association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sections 3 and 4 of Sub. S. B. No. 113 (later amended in certain respects by Am. Sub. S. B. No. 143), the General Assembly authorized the creation of the Savings and Loan Stabilization Special Account to be created from funds from the liquor control profits and mortgage insurance fund.  Section 4 also authorized the Director of Commerce, upon recommendation of the Superintendent of Savings and Loan Associations, to loan money to a new deposit guarantee fund to be created.  It also provided that no savings and loan association over which a conservator had been appointed could be a member. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 20, 1985, former Superintendent of Savings and Loan Associations, Thomas Batties, appointed a conservator for ODGF pursuant to R.C. 1157.01(A). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 8, 1985, ODGF filed an action in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County which was assigned to respondent herein, Judge George C. Smith.  The action was brought, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on authority of R.C. 1157.01(D) which authorizes suit to be filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County to seek removal of a conservator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Franklin County action named Governor Richard F. Celeste, the present and former&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  superintendents of savings and loan associations, Director of Commerce, Kenneth R. Cox, and the Deputy Superintendent of Savings and Loan Associations who was appointed conservator of ODGF, as defendants.  In addition to relief under R.C. 1157.01(D), the action sought a declaratory judgment declaring Sub. S. B. No. 113 unconstitutional and an injunction against the defendants for violations of their federal constitutional rights under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S. Code. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, the complaint alleges that Sub. S. B. No. 113 was enacted without compliance with the three-reading rule in Section 15(C), Article II, Ohio Constitution.  The complaint further alleges that the Act subjects ODGF to the deprivation of its property without due process of law and discriminates against ODGF; and that the Act's provisions authorizing the appointment of a conservator for ODGF is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and is unconstitutionally vague. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 12, 1985, the Superintendent of Savings and Loan Associations posted a notice taking possession of ODGF at its principal place of business in Hamilton County and filed liquidation proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Hamilton County, according to R.C. 1157.02. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same date, ODGF sought and obtained from Judge Smith an </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ex parte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> temporary restraining order prohibiting the defendants in the Franklin County action from &quot;* * * attempting to liquidate, dispose of, take possession of or otherwise control the assets and funds of the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund, and * * * [further enjoining them] from attempting to enforce against Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund any power purportedly conferred upon defendants, or any of them, by S. B. 113 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">].&quot; On April 15, 1985, the temporary restraining order was amended on reconsideration in respects not pertinent herein. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators, Governor Celeste, the Director of Commerce, and Superintendent of Savings and Loan Associations Robert B. McAlister, then filed this original action in prohibition against Judge Smith, seeking the issuance of a writ to prevent him from enforcing his restraining order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relators' request for an alternative writ and ODGF's motion to intervene as a respondent were granted on April 17, 1985.  ODGF then filed a motion to require relators to comply with the alternative writ which was denied.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The association was a mutual deposit guaranty association incorporated for the purpose of providing liquidity to its members and to guarantee the deposits in member institutions.

The association filed an action pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1157.01(D) seeking removal of the conservator. Subsequently, liquidation proceedings were commenced against the association pursuant to &sect; 1157.02. On the same day, the association obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO) prohibiting relators from attempting to liquidate the association. The court granted the relators' writ in prohibition against the trial judge holding that the TRO he issued had the effect of precluding relators from pursuing the exclusive statutorily prescribed remedies in &sect; 1157.02 and was a usurpation of judicial power. The court reasoned commencement of liquidation proceedings under &sect;1157.02 automatically terminated a prior conservatorship imposed pursuant to &sect; 1157.01(A), and consequently mooted any action commenced under &sect; 1157.01(D).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Zahorec was elected Mayor of the city of Lorain, Ohio for the term beginning January 1, 1984 and ending December 31, 1987.  On December 31, 1984, he was killed in an automobile accident.  Upon Zahorec's death, the President of the Lorain City Council was appointed mayor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 10, 1985, the Secretary of State's office advised the Director of the Lorain County Board of Elections that an election would be held in November 1985 for the balance of the mayor's term.  Several prospective candidates filed nominating petitions for the mayoral office which were certified by the board of elections on or about February 26, 1985.  The candidates had expended funds to advance their candidacies, and some had abandoned plans to file petitions for city council offices in order to join the mayoral race.  Relator, Charles F. Chevalier, filed a petition for the mayoral race and did not pursue previous plans to file a petition for reelection to his council seat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 7, 1985, the Secretary of State's office advised the Lorain County Board of Elections that the secretary's communication of January 10, 1985 had been in error and that no election would be held for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  balance of the mayoral term ending December 31, 1987. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was then commenced by Chevalier and Rita Hartman, a registered voter of the city of Lorain, against the Secretary of State, the Lorain County Board of Elections and all others who had filed petitions for the Lorain mayoral race.

The Board was soon advised, however, that the communication by the Secretary of State's office had been in error and that no election would be held for the balance of the mayoral term. Apparently none of the parties were aware of a July 26, 1984 amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.08, which did not authorize any election. The court denied the writ, holding that &sect; 733.08 was not to be retroactively applied. The court noted that the vacancy occurred over five months after the effective date of the amendment. The court noted that it was unfortunate that the council member and others relied to their detriment upon the erroneous statements and actions of the Board; however, the principle of estoppel did not apply against a state or its agencies in the exercise of a governmental function.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject of this appeal is the value of the Union Commerce Building for real estate tax purposes in the tax years 1977 and 1978. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1978, appellant and cross-appellee, the Cleveland Board of Education (hereinafter &quot;board of education&quot;) through its attorneys filed a complaint against the owners of the Union Commerce Building, Robert F. Black et al., Trustees of First Union Realty, with the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision (hereinafter &quot;board of revision&quot;).  In its complaint, the board of education sought an increase in the assessed value of the property from $ 9,247,390 to $ 12,586,700.  The $ 3,339,310 increase was derived from a reassessment of the fair market value of the building from $ 26,444,828 to $ 35,962,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full evidentiary hearing was held before the board of revision and a voluminous record was compiled.  Based on this record, which consisted of expert testimony and a substantial compilation of other evidence, the board ruled that the assessed valuation for the Union Commerce Building be increased by $ 5,452,610 to $ 14,700,000.  This latter figure constituted thirty-five percent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of $ 42,000,000, the fair market value of the property as determined by the board. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert F. Black et al., as taxpayer, and the Union Commerce Bank, as lessee of the building (hereinafter collectively &quot;UCB&quot;), appealed the board's decision to the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. 5717.05.  Specifically, UCB took exception to the fair market valuation as noted above.  The court gave the parties numerous opportunities to supplement the record with additional evidence, but did not permit a trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter proceeded to oral argument.  The trial court heard the appeal upon the record filed with the court by the board of revision, stipulations of the parties, resolutions by the board of education authorizing its law firm to initiate the reassessment complaints on its behalf, and the briefs and oral arguments of counsel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based upon its independent assessment of the evidence, the court essentially upheld the board of revision's valuation of the contested property.  The court found the fair market value of the building to be $ 41,500,000 for 1977 and $ 42,000,000 for 1978.  The court further concluded that the assessed value would be thirty-five percent of the true value&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the property.  This judgment was later modified to reflect a correction in the calculation of maintenance expenses, thereby fixing the 1977 and 1978 fair market values at $ 41,000,000 and $ 41,500,000 respectively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UCB appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County.  On appeal, UCB argued, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the refusal of the common pleas court to conduct a trial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contravened R.C. 5717.05, with the resultant effect of depriving UCB of its constitutional rights.  UCB further contended that the common pleas court violated Ohio law in its valuation of the property.  Finally, UCB alleged that the common pleas court applied a discriminatory and, therefore, unconstitutional level of assessment.  The court of appeals agreed and, accordingly, reversed and remanded the cause for a full evidentiary hearing consistent with its findings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion and cross-motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant board of education appealed from the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which reversed the decision upholding the Cuyahoga County Board of Revision's valuation of contested property, in the board of education's complaint against the owners of a building seeking an increase in the assessed value of the property, and remanded for a full evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The issues presented on appeal were whether the common pleas court abused its discretion in refusing to conduct a trial de novo or erred in its valuation of the building's property and whether a discriminatory level of assessment was applied. The court found that the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion in disallowing a trial de novo. The court found that the court of common pleas was only required to review the evidence thoroughly and comprehensively, and based on its evaluation of the evidence, the court was required to make an independent judgment regarding the taxable value of the property. Furthermore, the record did not establish that the court misunderstood the submitted evidence or erroneously determined the valuation of the property in question. The evidence showed that the court maintained an adequate administrative record. The court further held that the court of common plea's method of valuation and application of a uniform rate of assessment were proper. The court of common pleas based its decision upon ample evidence and modified the original findings to correct any existing errors. The applied level of assessment was not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plaintiff-appellee, Mrs. Pina Caruso, filed a claim for workers' compensation death benefits in 1976. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This claim alleged that the plaintiff's husband, Anthony Caruso, had died as a direct result of the occupational disease silicosis, which he had contracted within the course and scope of his fifteen-year employment with the defendant-appellant, Aluminum Company of America (&quot;ACA&quot;).  Mr. Caruso had retired from ACA on March 1, 1966, but he apparently did not exhibit symptoms of silicosis until September 1975.  At that time, Mr. Caruso was admitted to a hospital with complaints of shortness of breath and pain in his legs.  He remained hospitalized until his death on November 2, 1975. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Apparently, as a result of a &quot;clerical error,&quot; plaintiff's counsel became confused as to the exact date on which his client had filed her claim for death benefits.  This confusion then resulted in both parties devoting considerable time, both in the court of appeals and in this court, to &quot;statute of limitations arguments.&quot; Since these arguments were never presented in the trial court, they are not properly before this court and will not be discussed in this opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On September 13, 1978, a district hearing officer for the defendant Industrial Commission issued an order denying plaintiff's claim for death benefits.  The hearing officer's order was based upon R.C. 4123.68(Y), which, at the time that plaintiff filed her claim, stated in relevant part: &quot;Compensation * * * on account of silicosis * * * [is] payable only in the event of [disability] * * * or death, in accordance with sections 4123.56, 4123.58, and 4123.59 of the Revised Code, and only in the event of such disability or death resulting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">within eight years</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after the last injurious exposure; provided that such eight-year limitation shall not apply to disability or death occurring after January 1, 1976 * * *.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Emphasis added.) Because Mr. Caruso's &quot;last injurious exposure&quot; to substances known to cause silicosis had occurred no later than his last day of employment on March 1, 1966, nine years and eight months had elapsed before his death on November 2, 1975.  For this reason, the hearing officer found that he did not have subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff's claim. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;This version of R.C. 4123.68(Y) became effective on January 1, 1976.  (136 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2917, 2937.) See fn. 3, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c15">infra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plaintiff appealed first to the Cleveland Regional Board of Review which affirmed the hearing officer's order.  The Industrial Commission affirmed the board of review.  Plaintiff then appealed the decision of the Industrial Commission to the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County.  ACA filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and, on September 2, 1982, the court granted this motion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the judgment of the court of common pleas was reversed.  The appellate court held that the portion of R.C. 4123.68(Y) which denies compensation for silicosis-related deaths occurring prior to January 1, 1976 but more than eight years after &quot;injurious exposure&quot; is a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. </SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.68(Y) (amended 1976) was unconstitutional as it applied to a claimant that sought compensation for a silicosis-related death, which occurred prior to January 1, 1976 but more than eight years after the decedent's work-related exposure to substances known to cause silicosis. The court held that it was unconstitutional and affirmed. The test was whether the statutory prerequisites to compensation were rationally related to the accomplishment of some state objective at least as important as the purpose contained in Ohio Const. art II, &sect; 35 and reflected in the statute. Here, the statute was first enacted in 1945 when medical knowledge regarding silicosis was limited and the viability of the workers' compensation system was in doubt. However, each law's constitutionality was not cast in stone at the time of the law's enactment; nor was a law once found to be constitutional forever free from judicial scrutiny. Medical knowledge showed that silicosis could manifest after an eight-year, post-exposure period, and the workers' compensation system was no longer in danger of collapse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants, C&amp;D Partnership and its two general partners, John J. Cox and Michael A. Dehlendorf &amp; Co., filed this action on March 4, 1982 against the city of Gahanna, Mayor John Breen, the city council, the planning commission, and city council and planning commission members who served during 1979 and 1980.  Suit was brought against Mayor Breen and the members of council and the planning commission in both their official and individual capacities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties stipulated to the following facts.  On December 26, 1978, a preliminary plat of Deer Run, a proposed subdivision located within Gahanna, was submitted to the zoning officer for the planning commission pursuant to Section 1105.02 of the Planning and Zoning Code of the Codified Ordinances of Gahanna.  The planning commission approved the preliminary plat on January 10, 1979, contingent upon the availability of proper water service.  On or about July 31, 1979, appellants submitted the final plat for final approval by the planning commission and municipal engineer pursuant to Section 1105.04 of the city code.  The director of public service of Gahanna certified&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the planning commission that the availability of proper water service was assured on August 30, 1979 and thereafter, on September 12, 1979, the planning commission recommended to the council approval of the final plat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 18, 1979, Ordinance No. 105-79, approving and accepting the final plat, was introduced to the council and received its first reading.  Council, on October 2, 1979, voted to postpone the second reading of the ordinance until December 4, 1979 and on that date, council again voted to postpone consideration.  Council approved and accepted the final plat on April 1, 1980 by passing Ordinance No. 33-80.  The sole reason of the council for delaying approval and acceptance of the final plat from October 2, 1979 to April 1, 1980 was to study and make recommendations to solve storm water drainage problems in an approximately one-thousand-acre area of which the subject premises was a part, which storm water drainage problems became apparent as a result of flooding which occurred in August and September 1979. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The parties also agreed that all depositions could be used for purposes of motions for summary judgment and replies thereto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complaint also&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  alleged that the members of the planning commission and council, both in their official and individual capacities, acted willfully and maliciously, and with bad faith in delaying plat approval.  Further, Mayor Breen was alleged to have acted willfully and maliciously to coerce appellants to comply with storm drainage regulations which were enacted subsequent to the plat submission and which were not made retroactive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants sought compensatory damages and attorney fees against the city, council, and the planning commission and sought compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees against members of council, the planning commission and Mayor Breen pursuant to state law and Section 1983, Title 42, U.S. Code. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city filed a counterclaim, alleging appellants had begun grading and other construction and development work and had agreed to transfer some platted lots prior to the final plat approval contrary to local ordinances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court, ruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment, found that appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that the actions involved, as stipulated and testified to in the depositions herein, were discretionary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and legislative rather than merely ministerial, noting that council had authority to consider drainage in its plat approval decision.  The court also found that appellants had &quot;* * * failed to demonstrate that any delay arises to the level of a federal constitutional violation so as to justify relief under 43 [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] U.S.C. Section 1983.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court in a split decision.  The majority held that in failing to approve the proposed subdivision plat, the council was acting in an administrative rather than a legislative capacity, but that immunity from suit nonetheless attached because the action of approving a subdivision plat involves the making of a basic policy decision which is characterized by a high degree of official judgment or discretion.  The court further found that the individual members of council and the mayor were likewise immune from suit under Section 1983 and state law because the record indicates good faith, a genuine concern about flood drainage, and a lack of malice.  Finally, the court held the trial court properly overruled the motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability under Section 1983&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  because, at the very least, reasonable minds could differ as to whether delay in approving the plat is sufficient to constitute deprivation of a federal right. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dissent contended that sovereign immunity did not attach, reasoning that once the plat complied with the appropriate ordinances, neither the planning commission nor city council had discretion to refuse to approve the plat.  Correspondingly, the dissent further asserted that since under state law, there are genuine issues of fact with respect to liability and damages for the failure of the various individual defendants to comply with the ordinance, summary judgment was improperly granted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause is now before the court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arises from an assessment of personal property tax upon certain inventory property of appellee and cross-appellant, General American Transportation Corporation (&quot;GATC&quot;). GATC is a manufacturer of railroad tank cars and has a manufacturing facility located in Masury, Ohio. Approximately twenty-five percent of the tank cars are built for purposes of sale, while the remaining seventy-five percent are built for lease. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1980, the Tax Commissioner of Ohio, appellant and cross-appellee, assessed GATC for deficiencies determined in GATC's personal property tax returns for the years 1975-1978, inclusive. Specifically, GATC had included as personal property only twenty-five percent of its average monthly raw material inventory (&quot;RMI&quot;), reflecting the ratio of tank cars </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sold</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to tank cars </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">manufactured</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Tax Commissioner recomputed GATC's tax obligation to reflect the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">full</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> value of average monthly RMI levels, thus including the percentage of RMI to be used in the manufacture of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">leased</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cars as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GATC appealed the assessment to the Board of Tax Appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;), which affirmed the Tax Commissioner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on all questions pertinent to this appeal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal, the court of appeals reversed the ruling of the BTA, holding that only twenty-five percent of GATC's average monthly RMI was subject to personal property taxation. The court of appeals rejected GATC's contention that its RMI was not subject to personal property taxation by virtue of GATC's status as a public utility; however, the court did agree with GATC's argument that seventy-five percent of its average monthly RMI was exempt due to the leasing of seventy-five percent of the total cars manufactured. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant Tax Commissioner of Ohio and cross-appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Trumbull County (Ohio), which reversed a ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals affirming the Commissioner's assessment of deficiencies in the taxpayer's personal property tax on certain inventory property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer manufactured railroad tank cars. Approximately 25 percent of the cars were built for purposes of sale, and the remainder were built for lease. The Commissioner assessed deficiencies in the taxpayer's personal property tax due to its inclusion of only 25 percent of its average monthly raw material inventory (RMI) in the computation. The Commissioner computed the tax based on the full value of average monthly RMI levels, and the Board affirmed the assessment. The trial court reversed the Board's decision. On appeal, the court held that the average monthly value of all RMI of a manufacturer was subject to personal property tax, regardless of whether the final product was sold or leased, because the RMI of a manufacturer was &quot;used in business&quot; within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5701.08(A), (B). The court also held that the taxpayer's RMI was not exempt from personal property taxes by virtue of its public utility status because the taxpayer's manufacturing operations were distinct from its equipment leasing operations and the taxpayer was an equipment company for purposes of the exemption only to the extent that it was engaged in leasing cars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 29, 1982, Dawn M. Hendershot, a seven-year-old girl, failed to return home from school where she attended second grade.  An extensive search was conducted in and around the Massillon, Ohio area where Dawn Hendershot resided, but was unsuccessful in locating the missing girl. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses established that the girl had been seen entering a car upon leaving school the day she disappeared and that a young girl fitting Dawn Hendershot's description had been seen with a man in a car on a county road near a wooded area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald L. Maurer (hereafter referred to as appellant), who resided across the street from the Hendershot family, was interviewed several times by police in connection with Dawn Hendershot's disappearance.  On October 1, 1982, appellant's car was searched pursuant to a warrant and, among other things, a twelve-gauge shotgun with ammunition was seized.  That evening, appellant arrived at the police station at the invitation of the police.  After questioning, appellant confessed to the killing of Dawn Hendershot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant stated that he had arrived at the victim's school in order&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to pick up his stepchildren and other neighborhood children.  Dawn Hendershot entered appellant's vehicle.  Before any other children entered appellant's vehicle, appellant drove away.  Appellant and Dawn Hendershot drove into the country and stopped near a wooded area.  From there appellant and Dawn Hendershot left the vehicle and entered the woods on foot.  Appellant carried a twelve-gauge shotgun with him.  Appellant sat the young girl on a fallen tree and attempted to sexually molest her by placing a finger into her vagina.  Appellant then became frightened and tried to strangle Dawn Hendershot with her sweater.  When the girl struggled, appellant shot Dawn Hendershot in the back with the shotgun.  Appellant then covered Dawn Hendershot's lifeless body with twigs and leaves and returned home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning following his statement, appellant led police to Dawn Hendershot's body. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was indicted for aggravated murder with a specification, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> kidnapping, and gross sexual imposition.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of October 21, 1981, Leonard Jenkins (hereafter referred to as appellant) and Lester Jordan entered a branch of National City Bank.  Appellant, brandishing a handgun, directed the individuals in the bank to the rear of the building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant proceeded to disarm the bank's security guard by holding his gun to the guard's head.  Now in possession of two guns, appellant advanced with Jordan to each teller.  Appellant held each teller at gunpoint while Jordan removed the money from the drawers.  While this action was taking place, bank personnel were able to activate silent alarms connected directly to the police department.  Within minutes police were dispatched to the scene. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers John Myhand and Anthony Johnson were the first to arrive and parked their patrol car near the front of the bank.  Myhand approached the bank on foot, with Johnson following several steps behind.  Myhand reached the front door of the bank, peered inside, and viewed appellant near the door.  Myhand observed that appellant was armed and told Johnson, &quot;This is a good one, take cover.&quot; Immediately Myhand turned and began&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to run from the bank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Myhand had run a short way, he heard a single shot and then several more shots.  In the exchange of gunfire, both appellant and Johnson were wounded by bullets, Johnson mortally.  At that instant Myhand felt a sharp pain in the back of his right knee.  Apparently, believing that he had been shot, Myhand continued to hobble away from the bank and eventually fell to the ground. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the bank, when appellant saw a police officer approach the front door and look inside he stated that they would have to shoot their way out and proceeded to fire a shot in the direction of the front door.  After firing this single shot, appellant exited the bank where he and Johnson exchanged fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having stumbled to the ground, Myhand looked back at the entrance of the bank where he saw both Johnson and appellant lying on the ground outside the bank's entrance.  At that moment, Myhand observed a car backing toward him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point Officers Jerome Howard and Gregory L. Henderson arrived on the scene in response to the original dispatch to the bank.  Shortly before reaching the bank, Howard and Henderson had heard what they believed to be gunfire.  Howard and Henderson&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  observed Johnson and appellant lying in the vicinity of each other outside the bank as well as the car backing toward Myhand who was then struggling to get to his feet.  Thinking that the approaching vehicle was attempting to run him over, Myhand drew his gun and fired a single shot at the car.  Howard and Henderson both drew their weapons, each firing several shots in the direction of the car.  Two of the car's tires were flattened and the passenger window was shattered.  Nevertheless, the driver of the car managed to leave the scene of the shooting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The driver of the car, Douglas H. Robinson, was not involved in the commission of the robbery and appears to have been simply an innocent bystander.  Robinson's account was that he had driven a neighbor to the bank and was waiting in the parking lot with the engine running and the gear in reverse when the shooting began.  Robinson ducked to avoid the gunfire and lay down in the front of his car.  Robinson's car then began to drift toward Myhand which prompted the police to fire upon Robinson's vehicle.  Robinson received a gunshot wound to the back of his head but was able to drive to a friend's house and was taken to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jordan then exited the bank, was disarmed, apprehended, and made to lie down near appellant.  Appellant, Johnson, and Myhand were immediately transported by ambulance to the hospital.  Johnson subsequently died of a gunshot wound to the head.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court determined that defendant's convictions and sentence were proper. The court held that the death sentence statute was constitutionally valid because the sentencing authority was suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of a wholly arbitrary and capricious action in imposing the death sentence. The court determined that the trial court properly placed the burden of proving mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence upon defendant and that the State carried the burden of proving by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances defendant was found guilty of committing outweighed the mitigating factors. The court held that defendant was not denied his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury when the trial court excused four jurors for cause because the jurors displayed feelings regarding capital punishment that exceeded mere moral opposition against its imposition. The court held that defendant was not denied his statutory and constitutional rights to present evidence in mitigation of the death penalty by the trial court's action in excluding, as either irrelevant or incompetent, evidence proffered for purposes of mitigation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reviewed the three rationales supporting the &quot;void for vagueness&quot; doctrine and found that &sect; 4511.19(A)(2) provided fair warning, precluded arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, and did not unreasonably impinge, or inhibit, constitutionally protected freedoms. The court applied a two-prong test to determine if the statute was overbroad and held that the statute protected a substantial state interest and that the blood alcohol level set by the statute was reasonably related to lawful legislative ends. The court held that &sect; 4511.19(A)(2) did not create an irrebuttable presumption of guilt.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 20, 1978, Michael Farrier died as a result of injuries sustained in an army jeep accident.  At the time of the accident, Farrier was involved in annual summer training exercises near Fort Knox, Kentucky, pursuant to his duties as a member of the Ohio National Guard. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff-appellant, Marjorie Farrier, filed a workers' compensation claim for death benefits with the Industrial Commission of Ohio as Michael Farrier's widow, pursuant to R.C. 4123.59.  This claim was disallowed by the district hearing officer, based on the finding that Michael Farrier's death did not result during an Ohio employment within the ambit of R.C. 4123.021 and 4123.022, because the widow-claimant was eligible for, and received death benefits provided for in Section 321, Title 32, U.S. Code. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant then appealed this decision to the Regional Board of Review and the Industrial Commission, successively, but was unsuccessful on both occasions.  As a result, appellant filed this action in the court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, for death benefits.  Thereafter, both parties filed motions for summary&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judgment.  On October 12, 1982, the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, holding that appellant could not make a showing that the decedent was on &quot;state active duty&quot; at the time of his death in accordance with R.C. 4123.022; and that R.C. 4123.021 excludes from the definition of &quot;state active duty&quot; those persons for whom federal benefits are provided. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The decedent was killed during summer training exercises for Ohio National Guard members. The court held that although the decedent had been ordered to duty by Ohio, thereby meeting the first requirement for a National Guard member to be considered an employee of the State of Ohio for workers' compensation purposes, he had not met the second requirement that federal benefits not be provided to a National Guard member. The court noted that the widow had received federal benefits on behalf of the member, including a death gratuity, a burial allowance, and a life insurance policy. The court rejected the widow's argument that the denial of state benefits violated equal protection. It stated that the legislature had reasonable grounds for preventing employees who were eligible for federal benefits from receiving state benefits, the grounds being the legislature's intent to prevent a double recovery from both the Ohio and federal governments for the same injury, death, or occupational disease. Furthermore, the court stated, there was no merit to the widow's contention that Ohio Rev. Stat. &sect; 4123.021 denied her due process under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

The remaining question, then, was whether the city's municipal ordinance, which made the offense a first degree misdemeanor, conflicted with the general laws, under which the offense was a minor misdemeanor. The court held that in determining whether an ordinance was in conflict with general laws, the test was whether the ordinance permitted or licensed that which the statute forbade and prohibited, and vice versa. However, a police ordinance was not in conflict with a general law on the same subject merely because different penalties were provided for the same acts, even though greater penalties were imposed by municipal ordinance. Indeed, where the only distinction between a state statute and a municipal ordinance was the penalty and not to the degree of the offense, as measured by whether the offense was a misdemeanor or felony, the ordinance was not in conflict with the general laws of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pete A. Vega, appellee, was charged on November 9, 1982 with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol in violation of R.C. 4511.19.  An intoxilyzer test was administered; appellee tested at .17 of one percent of blood alcohol by weight.  Appellee pleaded not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to trial, on April 12, 1983, the state filed a motion </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">in limine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to exclude the testimony of appellee's proposed expert witness, Dr. Walter J. Frajola.  The trial court delayed its ruling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury trial was commenced in the Municipal Court of New Philadelphia, Ohio, on April 12, 1983.  When appellee called Dr. Frajola as a witness, the trial judge did not permit him to testify.  The court in its judgment entry found that &quot;* * * Dr. Frajola had no personal knowledge of the particular intoxilyzer instrument utilized in the administration of the breath test to * * * [appellee] * * * and, consequently, Dr. Frajola's testimony would have been relating, generally, to the reliability of the intoxilyzer and as such must be excluded upon the authority of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Grimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * * [(Dec. 30, 1980), Franklin App. No. 80AP-651, unreported], &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which this court finds persuasive in its reasoning and the rule of law * * * [which] shall be applied in this jurisdiction.&quot; Appellee then proffered Dr. Frajola's testimony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee was subsequently convicted and sentenced accordingly.  Appellee filed a notice of appeal on May 18, 1983. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a split decision, the court reversed, holding that an accused may present expert testimony to attack the reliability of intoxilyzers in general.  The court stated that &quot;* * * R.C. 4511.19(B), while replacing the requirement of expert testimony by statutory presumption, does so only insofar as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">state</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is concerned.  * * * There is no prohibition (nor can there ever be constitutionally) against the presentation of expert medical testimony on the part of the accused to show the nonexistence of a nexus between the testing result and the ultimate physical condition of the accused.&quot; The court concluded, then, that &quot;[t]o the extent that the appellant was prevented from going forward with his evidence on the element of whether or not he was under the influence of alcohol, the state was relieved of its constitutional duty to prove appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on that element of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the offense of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In dissent, Judge Hoffman reasoned that inasmuch as the proffered testimony was general and speculative in nature and did not speak to the specific test of the specific accused at trial, the testimony was properly excluded because R.C. 4511.19 provides for the admission of breath tests if properly administered.  He further stated that no constitutional right was destroyed as a result because the accused has no such right to introduce non-relevant general testimony. </SPAN></P>

The court found that the presumption did not deprive defendant of his right to present a defense because it was rebuttable by any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Such evidence included non-technical evidence of sobriety, such as a video tape or testimony by the accused or by witnesses concerning the accused's sobriety and amount of consumption, as well as technical evidence, such as additional chemical tests and the completion of field sobriety tests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause stems from a motor vehicle accident occurring on or about June 21, 1980 in Marion County.  Appellants are Harry E. Mauk and Norma L. Mauk, husband and wife.  Appellee, Timothy W. Mauk, is their son who at all times relevant was an unemancipated minor.  The underlying facts are not in dispute and are set forth below. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Mauk was operating his automobile in a northerly direction along State Route 423 in Pleasant Township.  Norma Mauk was traveling as a passenger in that vehicle.  Directly in front of them was appellee who was operating a truck owned by his father.  Attached to the top of the truck was a fourteen-foot extension ladder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, the ladder fell off the truck and into Harry Mauk's path.  He attempted to avoid it, thereby losing control of the car.  A collision resulted and appellants were injured.  They subsequently filed a complaint in negligence alleging that appellee had improperly secured the ladder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee moved for summary judgment, asserting that the claim was barred by the doctrine of parent-child immunity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff parents sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals for Marion County (Ohio), which affirmed summary judgment in favor of defendant minor, who was the son of the parents, in a negligence action brought by the parents against the minor for damages for injuries that they sustained in a car accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The parents were traveling in a car and their minor son was driving a truck directly in front of them on top of which a ladder was attached. The ladder slid off of the truck and caused the father to lose control of the car and crash. The parents were injured as a result of the accident and brought a negligence action against the minor. The minor moved for summary judgment claiming that the action was barred by the parent-child immunity doctrine. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment, which was affirmed by the appellate court. The parents sought review, contending that the time was right to repeal parent-child immunity. On review, the court affirmed and ruled that the parents were not only the minor's mother and father but they were also the owners of both of the vehicles and probably insured both. Thus, the court doubted that parties' interests were truly adverse, which could lead to fraud and collusion. Alternatively, if the party's interests truly were adverse, then the family unit would be disrupted. The court concluded that either result was unacceptable and thus the appellate court did not err in ruling that the parents' claim was barred by the minor's immunity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cause originated before the Board of Tax Appeals (hereinafter &quot;BTA&quot;) upon applications for review filed by Apartment &amp; Home Owners Association et al. and Roosevelt Properties Company et al., appellants herein.  The applications were filed in accordance with R.C. 5703.14 and 5715.61 in order to contest a recently adopted rule by appellee, the Commissioner of Tax Equalization. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule promulgated by appellee consisted of an amendment to Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-06.  The amendment was undertaken in accordance with the General Assembly's directive contained in R.C. 5713.041 that the commissioner adopt rules governing the separate calculation of tax reduction factors authorized under Section 2a, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By way of background, it should be noted that a tax reduction factor consists of a calculation designed to reduce the effect of inflation on a property owner's tax liability.  Prior to the approval by Ohio's electorate in November 1980, of Section 2a, Article XII, one reduction factor was employed for all classes of real property affected by a tax levy.  Section 2a, Article XII, however, authorized the division&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of real property into two classes in an attempt to alleviate the unfair tax burden placed upon residential and agricultural property owners as a result of spiraling inflationary trends.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State, ex rel. Swetland, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Kinney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 567, 572 [23 O.O.3d 479]. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Section 2a, Article XII was not self-executing, the General Assembly enacted legislation to effectuate the amendment.  See </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State, ex rel. Swetland, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Kinney, supra,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 572. R.C. 5713.041 provides in pertinent part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * For purposes of this section, lands and improvements thereon used for residential or agricultural purposes shall be classified as residential/agricultural real property, and all other lands and improvements thereon and minerals or rights to minerals shall be classified as nonresidential/agricultural real property.  * * * </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commissioner shall adopt rules governing the classification of property under this section, and no property shall be so classified except in accordance with such rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In response to this legislative directive, the commissioner promulgated an amendment to Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-06, which became effective October 20, 1981.  Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-06(B)(5) &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  provides as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Residential land and improvements' -- The land and improvements to the land consisting of one, two, three, or four dwelling units, one of which is occupied by the owner of the property.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1981, appellants filed their respective applications for review of Ohio Adm. Code 5705-3-06(B)(5) with the BTA, contesting the reasonableness and lawfulness of the commissioner's classification rule for &quot;residential property&quot; as that term is utilized within Section 2a, Article XII and R.C. 5713.041.  Appellants further sought to have the rule declared unconstitutional for being in conflict with the &quot;uniform rule&quot; requirement of Section 2, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution, as well as being violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 11, 1983, the BTA issued a split decision on appellants' application, with only two of the three statutory members of the board participating.  Since no majority existed among the BTA members, the board was required to uphold the rule.  See R.C. 5703.14(D).  In addition, the BTA correctly refused to address appellants' constitutional arguments on the basis that such arguments are not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  within its jurisdictional authority.

The decision upheld an amendment to a rule in Ohio Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The rule excluded the taxation of the owners' multi-unit rental properties from the application of residential reduction factors. The owners contended that the rule conflicted with existing law, was beyond the Commissioner's authority, and was beyond the public and the legislature's contemplation. The court affirmed the contested decision. The court found the rule delineated between homeowners and residential property owners, and those persons or concerns who owned land not as their home, but for commercial purposes or as business land-holders. The court concluded that &sect; 5705-3-06(B)(5) was consistent with Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2a, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5713.041. The court found that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5705-3-06(B)(5) did not violate Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2, because the owners' properties were used in a business or commercial capacity. The court concluded that the owners failed to demonstrate that the classification in Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 5705-3-06(B)(5) rested upon an unreasonable basis. The court decided that the requirement of owner occupancy was rationally related to a tax reduction factor for residential homeowners, rather than for commercial or business concerns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the decision appealed by the owners, which accepted the Commissioner's rule and its contested definition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the fall of 1981, plaintiff-appellant, Michael Kisil, purchased a single-family residence located at 508 Huron Avenue, Sandusky, Ohio.  The zoning classification for the neighborhood, in which plaintiff's property is located, is R2F, residential two-family.  In December 1981, plaintiff requested the approval of the city planning commission to convert the residence situated at 508 Huron to a duplex.  The request was denied by the commission on January 13, 1982.  The reason for the denial of plaintiff's request was that the lot on which the residence was located was insufficient in size to maintain a duplex, pursuant to Section 151.21 of the Sandusky Code of Ordinances.  Section 151.21 requires that the minimum lot size for a two-family dwelling in R2F district is 2,750 square feet per unit or a total of 5,500 square feet.  The plaintiff's property is only 2,100 square feet.  The plaintiff further admitted to the commission that he knew, at the time of purchase, that the previous owner's request to convert the property to a multifamily residential use had been denied.  The decision of the commission was affirmed on appeal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  by the Sandusky Zoning Code Board of Appeals on February 25, 1982. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 3, 1982, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506.  He sought a reversal of the decision of the board as unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.  In his amended notice of appeal plaintiff further sought declaratory relief finding the enforcement of the minimum lot size requirement contained in Section 151.21 as unconstitutional, in that it violates the equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.  The trial court reversed the decision of the board, finding the denial of a variance to be unreasonable and arbitrary in view of a variance granted to a neighboring property owner and the entire character of the neighborhood.  The court dismissed the request of plaintiff for declaratory judgment, finding the administrative appeal effectual to afford the relief plaintiff sought. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants-appellees appealed the decision of the trial court.  The appellate court reversed the trial court finding the substantial variance between plaintiff's lot size and the minimum requirement contained in Section 151.21, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  coupled with plaintiff's prior knowledge of the commission's denial of a similar request by the previous landowner, did not support a finding that the action of the board was unreasonable or discriminatory. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In an action against defendants, city and others, the trial court reversed the zoning board's decision affirming the planning commission's denial of plaintiff landowner's request to convert a residence to a duplex. The Court of Appeals for Erie County (Ohio) reversed the trial court's decision because the trial court's finding of unreasonable or discriminatory board action was not supported. The landowner filed a motion to certify the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The city denied the landowner an area variance to allow the conversion of a single-family residence to a two-family residence on a lot that was below the minimum area and yard requirements of the city zoning provisions. The court held that the grant of a variance would not have altered the character of the surrounding neighborhood because the record revealed the majority of the neighborhood was used as two-family residential rental property and many of these duplexes were on lots insufficient in size. The standard for granting a variance that related solely to area requirements was a showing of practical difficulties, not unnecessary hardship as required for variances that related to use. The court held that the allowance of other duplexes on lots insufficient in size in the same neighborhood and the granting of a multifamily variance to a neighboring landowner, while denying the landowner's request for a variance, were unreasonable and arbitrary enforcement of the zoning ordinances. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reaching its judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employee was injured in the course of his employment and was awarded temporary total disability benefits.

The court of appeals dismissed the employee's appeal for lack of a final, appealable order. The decision from the court of appeals was affirmed. The court found that the overruling of the employee's motion to dismiss an appeal filed in the trial court by the employer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.519 was not a final, appealable order within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.02. The trial court's order was not an order affecting a substantial right made in a special proceeding, and did not comport with that portion of &sect; 2505.02 making such orders final and appealable. Moreover, the trial court's order did not determine the action, as the merits of the employer's appeal had yet to be addressed.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To amend * * *, to enact * * * and to repeal sections [various sections of the] Revised Code to abolish the Ohio Development Financing Commission and transfer its duties to the Director of Development, to create the Development Financing Advisory Board, the Development Financing Policy Board, and the Division of Development Financing in the Department of Development * * *, to abolish the Development Advisory Committee, to provide for the appointment&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of legislative members to the various development program advisory boards and commissions, and to generally consolidate and reorganize the state's economic development assistance programs, and to make an appropriation.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill became law immediately upon approval of the Governor, containing an appropriation for the current expense of state government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 9, 1983, relator filed this original action in mandamus and prohibition, naming as respondents the following officials of the state of Ohio: Richard F.

No. 227 is unconstitutional and void, that the Ohio Development Financing Commission continues in force, that members of the Ohio Development Financing Commission as of July 13, 1983 may serve to the ends of their respective terms, and that a writ of mandamus issue to effectuate these ends.  Relator further sought a writ of mandamus to cause legal payroll warrants&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to be issued in payment of his statutory compensation as a member of the Ohio Development Financing Commission for July and August 1983.

The court denied the writ. The court ruled that Am. Sub. S.B. No. 227 was not enacted in violation of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D), which precluded bills containing more than one subject. The court held that the precedent dictated that the one subject rule contained in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 15(D) was directory rather than mandatory, thereby reducing judicial interference with legislative action. However, the court noted that they had a duty to enforce the Ohio Constitution, therefore a manifestly gross and fraudulent breach of the one subject rule will cause an enactment to be invalid. The court held that Am. Sub. S.B. No. 227 was not legislation contrary to the one subject rule because the topics in the bill, such as appropriation of funds and the abolishment of the Commission, related to the same subject matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Court of Appeals for Columbiana County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1979, Richard L. Nichols, appellant herein, was arrested, while on parole, for committing a series of burglaries.  Appellant was subsequently indicted by the Columbiana County Grand Jury on one count of aggravated burglary, three counts of burglary and sixteen counts of breaking and entering.  Appellant thereafter plea bargained and pled guilty in the Court of Common Pleas of Columbiana County to four counts of burglary and one count of breaking and entering.  Sentencing was deferred for two months pending the preparation of a presentence report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nichols was subsequently sentenced as follows: &quot;* * * to be imprisoned in the Ohio State Penitentiary on Counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 for a term of not less than 3 nor more than 15 years, and on Count 7, to the Ohio State Penitentiary for a term of not less than 1 nor more than 5 years, and they are ordered to be served consecutively.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 9, 1979, shock probation was denied.  Subsequently, Nichols' motion for probation was also denied.  On October 4, 1979 Nichols filed his first petition (denominated &quot;motion&quot;) for postconviction relief, pursuant to R.C. 2953.21, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  averring violations of his constitutional rights.  That petition was overruled on November 16, 1979.  On December 20, 1979 a second petition for postconviction relief, pursuant to R.C. 2953.21, was filed.  This second petition was effectively denied when the state's motion for summary judgment was sustained on January 18, 1980. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nichols, on January 31, 1980, filed a notice of appeal from the latter summary judgment motion.  On September 11, 1980, appellee filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that appellant had failed to cause a timely transmission of the record in this case.  On October 3, 1980 appellee's motion to dismiss the case was overruled and appellant's motion for extension of time was also overruled as moot.  Finally, on October 21, 1980, the court of appeals affirmed the court of common pleas' grant of appellee's motion for summary judgment.  Appellant subsequently filed another appeal, which we declined to review on May 27, 1981 (case No. 80-1770, no substantial constitutional question). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undaunted, Nichols redirected his efforts to the federal court system by seeking a writ of habeas corpus based upon issues not heretofore raised in the state courts.  The United States&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Magistrate reviewing appellant's petition correctly stated that Nichols had not exhausted all of his state court remedies with respect to his new constitutional claims and accordingly, under the federal habeas corpus statute, could not proceed with his petition.  The magistrate went on to suggest appellant should file a motion for leave to take a delayed appeal in order to review the trial court's judgment of January 18, 1980 and the findings of fact and conclusions of law rendered therein on September 3, 1980.  It is unclear whether the delayed appeal was to be with respect to appellant's original sentencing or later postconviction relief proceedings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 13, 1983 the Court of Appeals for Columbiana County denied appellant's motion for leave to take a delayed appeal with respect to postconviction relief under the rationale that there was no provision for such an appeal in a civil action.  On May 4, 1983 appellant had perfected his appeal to this court and on September 28, 1983 we accepted jurisdiction.  While the matter of jurisdiction was pending, the United States Magistrate issued his report and recommendations on July 6, 1983 and intimated this court would not accept jurisdiction. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On November 8, 1983 the district court issued a writ of habeas corpus which was subsequently vacated and stayed on January 17, 1984, pending the decision of this court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate was arrested for committing a series of burglaries. He pled guilty and was sentenced. The inmate's first petition for postconviction relief was denied, and his appeal from the denial of his second petition for postconviction relief was denied. Thereafter, the inmate went to the federal courts by seeking a writ of habeas corpus on constitutional claims. The federal judge suggested that the inmate take a delayed appeal in order to review the grant of summary judgment. The preceding court denied the delayed appeal because there was no provision for such an appeal in a civil action. On appeal, the court held that a delayed appeal filed pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 5(A) was not available in the appeal of a postconviction relief determination under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.23(B). In affirming, the court noted that postconviction relief proceedings were governed by the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure as applied to civil actions. The court stated that it was an inappropriate forum because the inmate's constitutional claims were never heard on appeal and concluded that the inmate had the option of filing a motion for delayed appeal from the original judgment and conviction.</SPAN></P>

The injury caused appellant to be absent from work for approximately two weeks, for which time wages were paid to her by her employer.  Appellee employer, a state fund insured employer, also paid appellant's medical bills relating to her injury.  No notice of the injury was given to the bureau or to the Industrial Commission prior to the June 17, 1980 filing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim was disallowed by an Industrial Commission district hearing officer on October 6, 1980 as not being timely filed in compliance with the applicable two-year statute of limitations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regional board of review affirmed the disallowance, and the commission refused appeal. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court and found that the statutory classification contained in Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs-appellees in the present case are all homeowners who live in Stark County, Ohio.  Each of the homes involved in the present action has been and is presently served by an individual household sewage disposal (septic) system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1978, a private developer began construction of a private sewer line in the street adjacent to the property owned by appellees.  This sewer line was authorized by the Stark County Commissioners by resolution executed pursuant to R.C. 307.73.  The purpose of this construction was to permit the development of a new allotment, providing sewer linkage to future owners.  Upon completion, the sewer line was donated to Stark County for use as a part of its sewerage system.  Appellees had no actual knowledge of the private sewer line until construction began. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the new sewer line became operational the Stark County Board of Health ordered appellees to abandon their septic systems and to connect their residences to the new sewer line.  Appellees were later notified by the county prosecutor that they would be prosecuted if they failed to comply with the order.  No inspection of the septic systems&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was made, prior to the board of health order, to determine if they violated any pollution or sanitation regulations.  Apparently, the only inspection was made one week before trial.  It revealed that all septic systems, save one or two, were in good operating condition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees filed this action seeking declaratory relief and seeking to enjoin any further action being taken to force them to connect to the sanitary sewerage system.  The trial court held that the board of health acted within the lawful scope of its authority to &quot;protect the public health by reducing the likelihood of health nuisances as a result of malfunctioning septic systems.&quot; On appeal the court of appeals reversed. </SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court's judgment was reversed. The court held that appellant possessed the authority to require that whenever a sanitary sewerage system became accessible to a property, the household sewage disposal system was required to be abandoned and the house sewer directly connected to the sewerage system. Thus, the court concluded that the requirement that house sewers be directly connected to a sanitary sewerage system when such a system became accessible bore a real and substantial relationship to the public health, was not unreasonable or arbitrary, and did not constitute a deprivation of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 13, 1981, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., intervening-appellee, filed notice of its intent to file an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (the &quot;commission&quot;), appellee, for an increase in rates.  The city of Cleveland, appellant, filed a petition to intervene on December 5, 1981.  The application was accepted for filing as of March 19, 1982 (case No. 81-1378-EL-AIR).  Appellant was granted leave to intervene on March 22, 1982.  The commission's staff conducted an investigation, after which public hearings were held. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost simultaneous to the events described above, the commission initiated proceedings concerning R.C. 4905.71 and 4905.72, enacted by the General Assembly effective November 2, 1981 (case No. 81-1109-AU-UNC).  Those sections require public utilities to permit attachments to their utility poles upon terms, conditions, and the payment of charges, all subject to regulation by the commission.  By entry dated February 10, 1982, the commission announced its intention to conduct hearings on the matter.  A request for proposed tariffs was journalized on March 31, 1982.  Intervening-appellee&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  submitted a proposed tariff pursuant to that entry which was not acted upon in that docket, but rather was acted upon at the staff's recommendation in the above-described rate case. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN MANDAMUS. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action in mandamus was instituted by relator, James M. Ryan, as a taxpayer and a citizen of the city of Gahanna, Ohio, against respondents, the City Council of Gahanna, the individual members of the city council, the clerk of council and the Mayor of Gahanna.  Relator filed his action on May 13, 1983, to block the issuance of bonds pursuant to Gahanna Ordinance No. 58-82. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Involved in this action is a dispute concerning the funding of an urban redevelopment project (&quot;project&quot;) begun by the city of Gahanna in 1978.  The initial legislation, adopted on March 20, 1978, which instituted the project was Ordinance No. 30-78.  The preamble of this ordinance purported in pertinent part that: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * [I]t is in the best interest of the city of Gahanna, Franklin County, Ohio, and its inhabitants to provide for an area within the City to attract industry and thereby creating [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">sic</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] jobs and employment opportunities * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinance No. 30-78 incorporated a previously conceived Urban Renewal and Redevelopment Plan which had been prepared by the city's Department of Development.  The stated objectives of that plan included the acquisition of land for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purpose of demolishing substandard structures, removal of blighting influences and establishing the use of the area for an industrial and office park. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 21, 1978, the city enacted Ordinance No. 85-78 which established additional guidelines for the plan.  The ordinance defined an &quot;Urban Redevelopment Project,&quot; as &quot;* * * undertakings and activities of the City, in accordance with the Urban Renewal or Redevelopment Plans in a blighted area for the elimination and for the prevention of the development or spread of blight * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinance No. 58-82 was enacted on June 16, 1982.  It provided for the issuance of bonds or notes in the amount of $ 2,000,721 for the funding of the project.  This is the first ordinance which addressed the manner of the funding of the project.  Ordinance No. 58-82 provided in pertinent part, that &quot;* * * Notes shall be the full general obligations of the City, and the full faith, credit and revenue of the city are hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the same.&quot; This ordinance also levied upon all taxable property in the city an additional tax for the payment of bonds and provided that: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The funds derived from said tax levy hereby required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shall be placed in a separate and distinct fund and, together with interest collected on the same shall be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of the Notes, or the bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when and as the same fall due * * *.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator's complaint in mandamus alleges that Ordinance No. 58-82, by issuing bonds as general obligations of the city and pledging moneys raised by taxation for their payment, was in violation of Sections 6 and 13, Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution and either R.C. Chapters 725 or 761.  The complaint asked that a writ be issued to compel respondents to issue the bonds in such a manner that they are revenue bonds not general obligations of the city, and not payable from tax dollars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 25, 1983, this court granted relator's request for an alternative writ to stop the issuance of the bonds pursuant to Ordinance No. 58-82.  Respondents then enacted Ordinance No. 48-83 on June 21, 1983.  This ordinance authorized the issuance of the bonds in the same manner as set forth in Ordinance No. 58-82.  On June 24, 1983, the bonds were issued.  As a result of the June 24, 1983 issuance of the bonds, in the manner&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  prohibited by the alternative writ issued by this court, respondents were found in contempt of court.  The order of contempt fined each respondent five hundred dollars or in the alternative gave them the option of reissuing the bonds in conformity with the alternative writ or cancelling the bonds.  Respondents chose to pay the fines on August 1, 1983. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court upon the merits of the complaint for a writ of mandamus.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Relator taxpayer brought an action in mandamus against respondents, a city council and its members, the clerk of council, and the mayor, to block the issuance of bonds or notes for an urban redevelopment project. The taxpayer argued that the issuance of the bonds or notes would violate Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 6 and 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer contended that the issuance of the bonds as general obligations of the city and and the pledging of moneys raised by taxation for their payment violated the Ohio Constitution. Respondents argued that because they were clearing a blighted area and redeveloping it as an industrial park, they were involved in a public purpose, not in a joint venture with private corporations as prohibited by Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6. The court rejected this argument. Stating that respondents had leased the property financed by municipal notes, which were issued in anticipation of long-term bonds, at a favorable rate to private corporations, the court stated that this was as much a joint enterprise as if respondents had given the money directly to the corporations to develop the land, construct their buildings, and carry on their activities in the industrial park. Moreover, the court stated, although Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect; 13 allowed for joint ventures for the purpose of economic development as long as moneys raised by taxation were not obligated or pledged for the payment of bonds, here respondents had pledged tax revenue for the repayment of the bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">This court ordered that a writ issue compelling respondents to comply with Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 6 and 13. It further restrained respondents from issuing the bonds or notes until they clearly stated on their face that such bonds or notes were not guaranteed by nor payable from specially designated tax moneys authorized by respondents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL From the Court of Appeals for Portage County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants, Dempsey T. Reed and Joan Reed, own a 32.58 acre tract in Rootstown Township, Portage County, which they purchased in 1974.  In 1979 appellants commissioned a survey and thereafter sought to carve out a 2.834 acre lot for a single family dwelling.  Appellants were advised by township officials that they would need to apply for a variance because the lot lacked frontage on a public road as required by the township zoning resolution.  The lot is accessible via a private road, the right of way of which was created by easements in appellants' deed and the deeds of other abutting owners.  This private road has been used continuously for approximately forty years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime after they had initially applied for and been denied a variance by the Rootstown Board of Zoning Appeals (&quot;board&quot;) and had filed an appeal with the court of common pleas, appellants were informed that most of the subject property was located in an open space and conservation (O-C) district, while only ten to twenty percent was located in the adjoining residential (R-1) district.  Appellants' proposed dwelling would necessarily be located in the O-C&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  portion of the lot.  Minimum lot size in the O-C district is five acres under the zoning resolution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants reapplied to the board and upon rehearing the board again denied the application, finding &quot;no hardship&quot; to justify the variance.  Appellants again appealed to the court of common pleas, which, in an action consolidating both appeals, reversed the board.  The court determined that the board had abused its discretion, noting that other homes had been built along the private road since the adoption of the zoning resolution.  The board appealed this decision to the court of appeals which reversed the trial court and reinstated the board's denial of a variance.  The court of appeals held that the board properly exercised its discretion, determining that the five acre minimum lot size was reasonable in light of the swampiness of the O-C district.  The court further noted that appellants could have used their surrounding property to create a five acre lot and thereby obviate the need for a variance with respect to the minimum lot size. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

The lower trial court reversed respondent's decision but the lower appellate court reinstated it and the court affirmed. The court found denial of the variance was proper because even if enforcement of the resolution requiring frontage on a public road to meet certain minimum standards was overcome, appellants could not overcome the required five acre minimum lot size requirement. The court first found that appellants created their own hardship in this regard because they could not explain why they had their surveyor not make the lot conform with the minimum size. The court also found that respondent had a legitimate reasons for the requirement including preserving the area's environment and reducing the problems of intensive development. Since these reasons were not arbitrary, confiscatory or unreasonable the denial was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal arises from an action in medical malpractice filed by Michael Opalko, through his father, and by his father, individually, against defendants-appellees, various doctors and Marymount Hospital, Inc. Michael Opalko died on March 2, 1981, after which his father as administrator of his estate was substituted as a party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged malpractice of the various defendants occurred at Marymount Hospital between June 17, 1974 and November 6, 1974, during which time Michael Opalko became nine years of age.  The Ohio Medical Malpractice Act, including the amendment to R.C. 2305.11, became effective on July 28, 1975. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original complaint was filed on April 8, 1980.  On April 28, 1981, the trial court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired.  Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed, holding first that R.C. 2305.11(B) may be applied retroactively so as to bar the cause of action that accrued in 1974 and, second, that the statute of limitations therein did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of either the United States or Ohio Constitutions. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant Albrecht, Inc. (&quot;Albrecht&quot;), is the lessee with option to purchase of a shopping center known as Hudson Plaza.  The center is located within the village of Hudson, appellee herein. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1978, Albrecht submitted building plans to the village relating to the proposed expansion of Acme Store Number 4, a property located within the shopping center.  The plans detailed work to be performed on the south, west and east sides of the building but did not indicate any alterations to the north side, which is that side which fronts the public street.  Appellant Krumroy Construction Company was hired by Albrecht to complete the work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plans were reviewed and approved by James R. Cox, Superintendent of Service and Superintendent of Building Inspection for the village.  They were then approved by the village's Architectural and Historic Board of Review (&quot;board&quot;), and a certificate of occupancy and a building permit were issued.  No additional or modified plans concerning the store were submitted to the village although, at appellants' request, Cox reapproved the original plans in May 1980, prior to the commencement of construction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thereafter, on the morning of March 4, 1981, Cox observed alterations being done to the north side of Acme Store Number 4.  Workmen were removing a long row of large plate glass windows from the building and replacing them with solid stone aggregate panels.  Due to the fact that this alteration had not been included in the approved plans, Cox issued a verbal stop work order and later that day issued a written stop work order.  Both orders were ignored by appellants and the replacement panels were completely in place on the following day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 15, 1981, the village filed an amended complaint in the court of common pleas seeking, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to enjoin appellants from performing any further work on the store or from occupying or using it until a permit for the disputed work was obtained.  Appellee further sought an order commanding appellants to remove the new panels from the building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants filed an amended counterclaim asserting, among other things, that portions of appellee's zoning ordinances were unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court upheld the validity of the village ordinances and ordered appellants to submit their plans for the disputed alterations in accordance&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the ordinances.

The trial court and the court of appeals upheld the ordinance and ordered the lessee and the construction company to submit their plans for the disputed alterations for approval. The court held that there was a legitimate governmental interest in maintaining the aesthetics of the community and that, as such, aesthetic considerations could be taken into account by the legislative body in enacting zoning legislation. The court further found that the ordinance also reflected a concern for maintaining property values, which was another legitimate interest of the village.

Barnett, appellant herein, was required by a provision of the divorce decree to pay the debts of the parties incurred during the marriage contracted on or before the date of September 2, 1980. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant was unable to meet the obligations of his creditors, and filed for relief in bankruptcy on February 27, 1981 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division.  Appellee was listed as a creditor in the bankruptcy petition schedules by way of an amendment filed on May&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  13, 1981.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears from the record herein that in the interim, on May 8, 1981, appellee had filed a motion seeking a contempt order against appellant for his failure to pay the debts of the marriage, pursuant to the order of the divorce decree. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Specifically, said motion alleged that appellant had failed &quot;to pay the debt owing to The First National Bank of Warren County, Ohio.  Said willful act is jeopardizing Plaintiff's credit and could result in the repossession by said Bank of her motor vehicle.&quot; Appellant responded in such contempt action that an automatic stay existed since the filing of his petition in bankruptcy and that, accordingly, the action in the state court could not go forward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A referee in the Division of Domestic Relations, Court of Common Pleas of Warren County, heard the matter, and found that the automatic stay of the bankruptcy court existed and was effective as to the provisions in the divorce decree relating to the marital debts.  The referee recommended to the court to deny the motion for contempt until such time as the bankruptcy court ruled whether the debts were dischargeable in bankruptcy.  The referee's report was subsequently adopted by the court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There appears to be no disagreement that appellee did not pursue any means available to obtain relief from the stay pursuant to Section 362(d), Title 11, U.S. Code. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, it appears that appellee did not contest the discharge of any of the debts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  listed on the petition in bankruptcy or its amendment.

Further, the court noted that the contempt action was not brought to uphold the dignity of the trial court, but to enforce a judgment. The court held that the automatic stay provision did not violate the Tenth Amendment because 1) the automatic stay provision did not regulate the &quot;states as states,&quot; but regulated individual creditors and debtors involved in bankruptcy proceedings; 2) the automatic stay provision did not attempt to address matters that were &quot;indisputably attributes of state sovereignty.&quot; Rather, matters of bankruptcy were exclusively within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts. The provision allowed the bankruptcy court a period of time to determine which of the debtor's debts were dischargeable; and 3) the automatic stay provision did not &quot;directly impair&quot; the state's ability to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions. The provision did not foreclose the state court's use of contempt powers in matters generally within divorce proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 21, 1978, appellants, J. Phillip Richley, Mayor of the city of Youngstown, and the city of Youngstown, filed a declaratory judgment action in the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas.  The named defendants were the Youngstown Civil Service Commission and its three members, and twenty-seven employees of the city's Community Development Agency (hereinafter &quot;CDA&quot;).  The complaint requested the court to determine the status of the CDA employees in relation to Ohio civil service coverage and to declare R.C. 124.271 to be unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 30, 1978, the mayor and the city filed a second declaratory judgment action, this time naming as defendants the Youngstown Civil Service Commission and its three members, and sixteen employees of the city who had been accorded permanent civil service status as a result of the application of R.C. 124.271.  Again, the mayor and the city alleged that the application of R.C. 124.271 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court consolidated the two cases, and, following trial held that R.C. 124.271 was constitutional and that all city employees who met the provisions therein were entitled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to permanent civil service status. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellants, a city and its mayor, sought review of an order from the Court of Appeals for Mahoning County (Ohio), which, in a declaratory judgment action brought against the city civil service commission and employees of the city's community development agency (CDA), affirmed a ruling that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The mayor and the city alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.271 was unconstitutional in that it violated the constitutional mandate that merit and fitness for civil service positions be ascertained by competitive examination. On review the court disagreed. The court found that Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 10 did not pose an inflexible mandate of testing. The court recognized the danger and embarrassment that would probably attend any attempt to fix, by a provision in the constitution, any hard and fast method of determining the constitutional requirement of merit and fitness. The court noted that the employees had requested examinations, but their efforts were frustrated by the mayor's failure to follow the proper appointing procedures. The court held that an appointing authority could not assert the failure of the employees to take examinations when the failure was the result of his neglect of his statutory duty. The court held that continuous performance in a position for two years might constitute an acceptable substitute for competitive testing to determine the constitutional requirement of &quot;merit and fitness.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 29, 1980, defendant-appellee Michael R. Barker, a resident of West Virginia, and two companions drove an automobile into Ohio to hunt deer.  According to Barker's testimony, attached to, and operated from, the car driven by Barker was a spotlight which was later used from within the car to locate and kill a doe.  The automobile was used for these &quot;personal&quot; purposes without the permission of the registered owner, Barker's employer, defendant-appellee Joe Holland Chevrolet, Inc.  Barker did, however, have limited authorization to use the vehicle and had he been in an accident, there was testimony to the effect his employer's insurance would have covered such a contingency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the doe was caught in the ray of the spotlight, Barker shot and killed it from the automobile.  This technique, known as &quot;spotlighting&quot; or &quot;jacklighting,&quot; is prohibited by R.C. 1533.161.  Jacklighting involves shining a light into the eyes of the deer.  The deer will then freeze, making it an easy target for the hunter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 31, 1980, Barker pled guilty to having violated R.C. 1533.161.  The car was subsequently ordered forfeited pursuant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to R.C. 1531.20.  The court of appeals reversed the decision of the trial court, and upon appeal, this court, in case No. 81-1735, remanded the cause to the court of appeals for determination on the second assignment of error.

The trial court entered a forfeiture judgment in favor of the State and upon review, the appellate court reversed. The court, however, held that an automobile was an &quot;other device&quot; within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1531.20 when construed in pari materia with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1533.161. The court held that thus the employer's truck could be forfeited because it was used for an illegal purpose. The court held that the forfeiture did not violate due process of law under the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Ohio because it was within the State legislature's police power to enact statutes for deterrent and punitive purposes.

The appellate court found that there was no accord and satisfaction and that there had been a retroactive application of the law in determining the reimbursement rates. On appeal, the court reversed finding that it was error for the appellate court to reverse the trial court because the trial court's findings were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This matter arises from an action filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County by fourteen workers' compensation claimants (&quot;appellees&quot;) against the Industrial Commission of Ohio, three members thereof, and William J. McCloud, M.D. (&quot;appellants&quot;). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appellees alleged that Dr. McCloud had examined twelve of them; that his examinations had been inadequate and incomplete; and that the reports of these examinations contained intentional misrepresentations resulting in the denial or reduction in their workers' compensation benefits.  Hence, they sought judgment against Dr. McCloud for compensatory and punitive damages.  Moreover, appellees sought injunctive relief for the purpose of preventing the commission from referring any and all claimants to Dr. McCloud. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Dr. McCloud is an orthopedic specialist, who, when requested by the commission, performs three functions: (1) examines workers' compensation claimants to determine the nature and extent of their claimed injury and resulting disability; (2) prepares and submits his medical report containing his medical findings and opinions relating to his examination of the claimants; and (3) testifies as to his medical findings and opinions at administrative and judicial proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellants subsequently filed motions for summary judgment, which were granted.  The basis of the decision in favor of Dr. McCloud was that the &quot;* * * function being performed by Dr. McCloud in examining the claimants and filing material reports is that of a witness furnishing testimony in an adjudicatory proceeding which entitles him to absolute immunity from civil suit.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellees appealed the trial court's decision to the court of appeals.  The appellate court affirmed the summary judgment entered for the Industrial Commission because the subsequent action of the parties had rendered the issue moot.  The appellate court, however, reversed the summary judgment entered for Dr. McCloud.  The basis of its decision was that: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;* * * a doctor who has undertaken a duty to examine an individual for the purpose of reporting the medical condition of that individual to an adjudicatory body is liable for any damages resulting from said doctor's failure to conduct a medically adequate examination, notwithstanding that the report thereon is privileged under the doctrine of witness immunity.&quot; </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the doctor was not entitled to immunity. The court held that an independent physician examining workers' compensation claimants, at the request of the commission for the purpose of reporting their medical conditions, was not absolutely immune from a civil suit based on his examinations, notwithstanding that his report and testimony at an adjudicatory proceeding were privileged under the doctrine of witness immunity. The doctor's out-of-court physical examinations of the employees were a medical fact-finding function rather than a quasi-judicial function.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The hospital treated the 14-year-old patient in 1977. The complaint was filed in 1979. The Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11(A) established a one-year statute of limitations in actions for malpractice against hospitals. Section 2305.11(B) provided that a minor who had not attained his tenth birthday had until his fourteenth birthday in which to file an action for malpractice against a physician or hospital. Section 2305.11(B) led the court to the conclusion that the statute created a distinction, without reasonable grounds, between medical malpractice litigants who were younger than ten years of age and those who were older than ten but still minors. Under &sect; 2305.11(B) a child whose cause of action accrued on the day before his tenth birthday could file an action any time until his fourteenth birthday. Yet, if the same cause of action accrued on the day after the child's tenth birthday, the one-year provision of &sect; 2305.11(A) apparently controlled. Therefore, in light of the conclusion that &sect; 2305.11(B) created an irrational classification, the court held that &sect; 2305.11(B) was unconstitutional on its face with respect to medical malpractice litigants who were minors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before midnight on April 19, 1977, a motorist entered the Speedway gas station at the corner of Pippin and Galbraith Roads in Hamilton County, Ohio.  There, he discovered the body of Jeffrey D. Stahl, a high school student and Speedway attendant, who had been shot in the chest.  The cash register on the counter was open, and it was subsequently determined that $ 166.37 had been stolen from the station.  As police officials had earlier that evening investigated an incident occurring nearby in which appellant Tyrone C. Williams, Kevin Metz and a juvenile had, armed with a pistol, threatened a young boy, the officers decided to question the three regarding the murder.  The officers first queried Metz and the juvenile, whose comments alerted the officers of appellant's possible involvement in the murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers, acting without a warrant, were admitted into appellant's home by his sister.  After appellant was arrested and advised of his rights, he led the officers to a stereo set in which was concealed a .38 caliber revolver.  While en route to the police station, appellant made inculpatory statements to Deputy&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sheriff Robert D. Pieper and later, while in custody at the station, issued another statement admitting his involvement in the crime.  Both statements were made after appellant received recitations of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights.  The latter statement was taped. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pretrial hearings, appellant moved to suppress the admission into evidence of the first confession and the gun, alleging that his arrest violated the mandates of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Appellant also sought suppression of the second confession, claiming that it was obtained through the breach of his Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination.  The trial court denied both motions, and in a jury trial appellant was subsequently convicted of both aggravated robbery and aggravated murder with specification.  For his offenses, appellant was sentenced, respectively, to a prison term of seven to twenty-five years and death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon appeal, the appellate court, after granting appellant's motion to modify the death sentence to life imprisonment, upheld both convictions.  The court of appeals ruled that both the arrest and the interrogation preceding appellant's second confession were legal. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, the panel determined that the trial court had not committed prejudicial error in conducting the in camera </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of jurors who had been exposed to improper influence during a view of the scene of the crime and that the court had not abused its discretion in refusing to discharge one of the jurors upon conclusion of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This court initially overruled appellant's motion for leave to appeal on March 4, 1981 (case No. 81-73), and he then appealed to the United States Supreme Court.  In a ruling, rendered June 15, 1981, that Court issued an order which stated, in pertinent part: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, it is ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the above court [First District Court of Appeals] in this cause is vacated, and that this cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals of Ohio, Hamilton County, for further consideration in light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Edwards </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Arizona</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 451 U.S. [477] (1981).&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon remand, the court of appeals again affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that appellant's second confession was not unlawfully induced and that even if it had been, the admission of the confession would merely have been harmless&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  error. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of aggravated robbery and aggravated murder. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County (Ohio) upheld both convictions. The court of appeals initially overruled defendant's motion for leave to appeal. On appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the Court ordered a remand to the court of appeals for further consideration. On remand, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The supreme court found: (1) defendant's first confession was admissible because the law enforcement officials were acting in good faith reliance upon the then constitutional interpretation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.04 when they arrested defendant without a warrant; (2) the trial court's failure to ensure defendant's presence at the voir dire proceeding was a violation of both his constitutional and statutory rights, but the error was not grounds for reversal because the defendant's interests were adequately represented by his attorney, his attendance would have contributed little to his defense, and his failure timely to object constituted a waiver of his right to be present; (3) the court's decision not to discharge a juror mandated the invalidation of appellant's convictions because the juror gave unqualifiedly affirmative replies to the court's inquiries concerning her capacity to disregard and to remain impartial despite the improper communication she had been exposed to; and (4) admission of confession obtained in violation of defendant's constitutional rights was harmless, because the remaining evidence alone comprised overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an appeal from a decision by the Board of Tax Appeals (&quot;BTA&quot;).  In its decision, the BTA imposed assessments on appellant, Boothe Financial Corporation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These assessments arose out of appellant's operations in tax years 1970 and 1971. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;Boothe Financial Corporation was formerly known as Boothe Computer Corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During those years, appellant owned computer equipment which it leased to customers in Ohio.  The equipment appellant leased was manufactured by International Business Machines (&quot;IBM&quot;), and appellant acquired this equipment either by direct purchase from IBM or indirectly through third-party transactions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During this period, IBM also leased the same type of computer equipment to customers in Ohio. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;Appellant would effect indirect purchases from IBM by giving the purchase price of a computer to one of IBM's lessees.  Then the lessee would use the money to purchase the equipment from IBM by exercising an option in its lease agreement with IBM.  Appellant would take title to the computer and lease it to the former IBM lessee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On their Ohio personal property tax returns, both IBM and appellant were required to report the leased equipment under Schedule Four as property not used in manufacturing.  Each was required to report the &quot;true value&quot; of the equipment.  The leased computers were taxed at seventy percent of true value. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM based true value on manufacturing cost less depreciation.  In its tax returns for 1970 and 1971, appellant filed a claim to reduce the value of its equipment to a level uniform with IBM.  Like IBM, appellant sought to reach true value by manufacturing cost less depreciation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon an audit of appellant's return, the appellee's agent increased the true value of the equipment to acquisition cost less depreciation.  Consequently, appellant's equipment was assigned a true value approximately six times that of IBM's for the same type of equipment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">3&nbsp;In some instances the same computers were involved.  Appellant would indirectly purchase computers that IBM had been using.  The following year, appellant was required to base the value of the machine on acquisition cost so that the value would increase about six-fold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Appellant filed applications for redetermination with the appellee.  In part, appellant argued that the disparity of true value between it and IBM constituted a denial of equal protection.  The appellee rejected this argument, finding that it did not have jurisdiction to address this constitutional issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals.  The board affirmed, without addressing appellant's constitutional claim. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment from the Board of Tax Appeals (Ohio), which upheld the imposition by appellee Ohio Tax Commissioner of assessments on the taxpayer arising out of the taxpayer's operations in two tax years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer and a competitor were required by statute to list their personal property at 70 percent of true value in money by using depreciated book value. The taxpayer, who leased his equipment, was required to base its book value on acquisition cost, while a competitor, who manufactured equipment, based its book value on manufacturing cost, with its concomitant gross undervaluation. The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed the Commissioner's decision. The taxpayer sought review, contending that the unequal treatment of the taxpayer and the competitor denied the taxpayer equal protection. On appeal, the court held that the taxpayer was denied equal protection when a competitor, who manufactured and leased essentially identical equipment, was allowed to grossly undervalue its property by reporting the property's value as manufacturing cost less depreciation, and the taxpayer was not allowed to value his property in the same manner. The Commissioner intentionally and systematically treated members of the same class, lessors of equipment, differently because one was a manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, which had upheld the Commissioner's imposition of tax assessments on the taxpayer, and remanded the cause in order that the taxpayer may have been allowed to report the value of its property in the same manner as its competitor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, William G. Schultz, was elected to the office of Clerk of the Springfield Municipal Court for the six-year term commencing January 1, 1978.  His salary was computed pursuant to R.C. 1901.31 (C), which at the time he took office provided that &quot;* * * the clerk shall receive annual compensation in a sum equal to eighty-five per cent of the salary of a judge of such court.  * * * The clerk's compensation shall not exceed that of the clerk of courts of the county in which the municipal court is located.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When appellant took office, the Springfield Municipal Court judges were paid a salary of $ 38,750 per year, eighty-five percent of which is $ 32,937.  However, pursuant to R.C. 325.08, the salary of the Clark County Clerk of Courts was fixed at $ 22,500.  Due to the limitation in R.C. 1901.31 (C), appellant's salary was fixed at $ 22,500. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effective December 20, 1980, R.C. 325.08 was amended to provide for an increase in the salary of the Clark County Clerk of Courts to $ 24,750 in 1981, $ 26,250 in 1982, $ 27,750 in 1983, and $ 29,250 in 1984 and thereafter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant requested an increase in his salary equal to that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  granted the county clerk by the amendment of R.C. 325.08, which request was denied by the appellees, the Finance Director for the city of Springfield and the Clark County Auditor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant then brought this action in the court of common pleas against the city finance director and the county auditor seeking a judgment declaring that he was entitled to the increase in salary.  The court of common pleas held that the appellant was not entitled to the increase in salary and the court of appeals affirmed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court of appeals, finding its judgment to be in conflict with the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Stark County in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Radel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events leading to this appeal are as follows: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raymond E. Ferguson, appellee and cross-appellant herein (&quot;appellee&quot;), was the manager of an apartment complex in Bedford Heights.  Susan Zelko, the victim and prosecuting witness, approached appellee in the course of her efforts to locate an apartment in the area.  Appellee subsequently arranged to lease her an apartment.  Evidently a friendship arose between the two and they dated on several occasions prior to the incident which culminated in appellee's arrest and conviction.  The victim testified that on these prior occasions, she and appellee had kissed, necked, and petted, but never had sexual intercourse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of March 12, 1980, appellee and the victim went together to a restaurant and lounge called the Proud Pony where both had several drinks.  After spending several hours at the Proud Pony, the victim invited appellee to her apartment for another drink. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at her apartment, the victim received a telephone call from a person identified as Ron Buzzato, a friend of the victim's.  It appears that Buzzato questioned the victim as to her&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whereabouts that evening.  In the presence of appellee, the victim responded that she had been out with girlfriends and terminated the telephone call shortly thereafter.  Appellee allegedly became enraged that the victim had been untruthful in not admitting being with him all evening.  An angry confrontation ensued and the victim attempted to evict appellee from her apartment.  After appellee refused to leave, the sexual attack which provided the basis for appellee's arrest and conviction occurred.  The victim testified: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He made me perform oral sex a couple times, three times.  And he did it to me.  And then we had intercourse a couple times.  Just kept going back and forth.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee was indicted on six counts of rape under R.C. 2907.02 as a result of the above episode.  At trial, the prosecution was based mainly on the testimony of the victim.  Appellee exercised his privilege not to testify on his own behalf.  A jury convicted appellee of all six counts in the indictment.  Appellee was sentenced to serve consecutive terms of seven to twenty-five years on two counts and four to twenty-five years on the remaining four counts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee gained a new trial in the court of appeals&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on two grounds.  First, the court of appeals ruled that appellee should have been permitted to cross-examine the victim concerning a contemplated civil suit between the victim and appellee's former employer.  Second, the court below determined that the prosecutor's reference to &quot;uncontradicted&quot; evidence in closing argument was an impermissible comment on appellee's failure to take the stand.  The court below rejected appellee's contentions that the state produced insufficient evidence for a conviction and that R.C. 2907.02(D) was unconstitutional as applied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause is now before the court upon allowance of a motion and cross-motion for leave to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with two counts of rape involving vaginal or anal intercourse and four counts of rape involving fellatio and cunnilingus. The trial court convicted defendant but the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County (Ohio) reversed and ordered a new trial. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court granted defendant a new trial because the State impermissibly commented on defendant's failure to testify and defendant was barred from cross-examining the victim about a civil suit against defendant's former employer. The court found that (1) a reference by the State in closing argument to uncontradicted evidence was not an impermissible comment on defendant's failure to testify where the comment was directed to the strength of the State's evidence, and the jury was instructed not to consider defendant's failure to testify, (2) evidence of the victim's prior sexual activity with a person other than defendant was inadmissible to impeach the victims testimony, (3) the victim's contemplated civil action against defendant's former employer, stemming from the victim's alleged rape, was a permissible subject of cross-examination in order to demonstrate any possible bias because the victim stood to benefit financially from defendant's conviction, and (4) the victim's testimony that she and defendant had intercourse was insufficient to sustain the rape convictions absent evidence of penetration or explicit reference to sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment on the issues of the State's comments on defendant's failure to testify and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions for rape involving vaginal or anal intercourse, affirmed in all other respects, ordered that judgments of acquittal be entered on the two counts of rape involving vaginal or anal intercourse, and ordered a new trial on the remaining counts.</SPAN></P>

On May 18, 1978, Glenn E. Nicodemus was involved in a fatal accident while in the employment of Contractors Service Co.  His surviving spouse, Carol Nicodemus, appellee and cross-appellant herein (hereinafter &quot;relator&quot;), filed an application for death benefits.  The claim was allowed and the employer timely appealed to the Dayton Regional Board of Review.  On December 17, 1979, the board of review affirmed the commission's order allowing the claim and on February 7, 1980, mailed copies of its order to relator, her attorney, the bureau's law director, the employer and Gates, McDonald &amp; Company, an actuarial firm which had appeared at all hearings on behalf of the employer. Gates, McDonald received a copy of the order on February 8, 1980.  The employer's copy, however, was sent to the wrong address and returned to the commission by postal authorities.  In March 1980, a check was mailed to relator for payment in accordance with the order.  Apparently, the employer was notified that payment had been made and thereupon contacted Gates, McDonald to inquire about the payment.  On April 10, 1980, Gates, McDonald&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  mailed a copy of the order to the employer which was received no later than April 13, 1980. On May 13, 1980, the employer filed a motion under R.C. 4123.522 to obtain additional time in which to appeal.  The motion was denied by the Industrial Commission and the employer appealed to the board of review.  The board determined that it was without jurisdiction to consider the appeal and transferred the appeal to the Industrial Commission for hearing. Following a hearing on February 24, 1981, the commission entered an order granting the employer's motion and allowing the employer an additional twenty days in which to file an appeal.  Copies of the order were mailed on March 6, 1981, and on March 11, 1981, the employer filed its notice of appeal. Relator then brought this action in mandamus in the court of appeals, alleging that the commission abused its discretion by granting the employer relief under R.C. 4123.522, and requesting that a writ issue to compel the commission to vacate its order.  Stipulations of fact and the claim file were submitted to the court of appeals.  The court of appeals allowed the writ and the cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right taken by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the commission.  Relator has filed a cross-appeal, urging that R.C. 4123.522 is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In an action regarding the payment of death benefits to relator, the spouse of a deceased employee, an appeal was taken from a decision of the Court of Appeals for Franklin County (Ohio) that allowed a writ of mandamus compelling respondent industrial commission to vacate a judgment granting the employer additional time in which to appeal an order allowing the spouse's claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court granted a writ of mandamus compelling the industrial commission to vacate an order granting the employer additional time in which to appeal a judgment allowing relator's claim for benefits. The industrial commission's order had been based on a finding that the employer had not received proper notice that the time for further appeal had begun to run. On appeal, the court noted that the appellate court had determined that timely receipt of notice by the employer's actuarial firm, which had been involved in the proceedings, served as notice to the employer. The court disagreed and reversed. It held that if the actuarial firm, as the employer's representative, had been an attorney, the notice received would have been imputed to the employer. As that was not the case, the employer could not have been said to have received timely notice, the decision granting the writ was reversed, and the writ was denied.</SPAN></P>

On October 23, 1980, the Grand Jury of Marion County indicted six individuals </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for violations of R.C. 1333.92, sometimes referred to as a section of the Ohio Pyramid Sales Act. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indictments charged that each individual: &quot;* * * [D]id propose, plan, prepare, or operate a pyramid sales plan or program as defined in Section 1333.91 of the Revised Code; said proposed plan, preparation or operation of compensation in said pyramid sales plan or program being in excess of $ 150.00 in violation of Section 1333.92 and Section 1333.99(H) of the Ohio Revised Code.&quot; <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All six defendants filed motions to dismiss&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the indictments.  In ruling on the motions on March 18, 1981, the court of common pleas held that the words &quot;plan&quot; and &quot;prepare&quot; in R.C. 1333.92 were unconstitutionally vague and sustained that portion of defendants' motions.  Resultantly, the motions to dismiss were granted, and upon appeals by the state, the court of appeals affirmed the judgments below dismissing all defendants.  However, the court of appeals did not find R.C. 1333.92&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague; rather the appellate court concluded that R.C. 1333.92 is unconstitutional because it is overbroad.  The court of appeals stated: &quot;* * * R.C. 1333.92 is overbroad in that it encompasses within its provisions and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">might well</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> penalize conduct which is not criminal in nature * * *.&quot; (Emphasis added.)

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Six defendants were indicted by a grand jury for violations of Ohio Rev.

The lower appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the indictments, but it concluded that &sect; 1333.92 was unconstitutional because it was overbroad. On appeal, the court found &sect; 1333.92 and the penalty provision of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.99 was constitutional, and reversed the dismissal of the indictments. The court agreed with the lower appellate court's holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.92 was not unconstitutionally vague. There could be no constitutional challenge to any set of particular facts that were before the trial court because it did not have any true evidence before it. Next, &sect; 1333.92, when considered together with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1333.99, was not unconstitutionally overbroad.

This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for Summit County.  That court affirmed a trial court's decision which enjoined appellants </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from constructing apartment complexes on two parcels of land located in Green Township, Summit County.  The appellees, who initiated this action, were the Board of Trustees of Green Township. <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The appellants are Phillip G. Rock, Thomas Zaratsian and Olean E. Jones, executrix of the estate of Royce Jones.  Royce Jones was one of the defendants; however, his death necessitated the substitution of the executrix of his estate as a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This dispute arose out of an amendment to the Green Township zoning ordinance.  On April 23, 1980, the appellees amended the Green Township zoning ordinance, in part, to exclude multi-family structures from R-1 zones.  The ordinance became effective May 24, 1980. On the same day that the zoning ordinance was amended, April 23, 1980, appellants received a zoning permit to construct a twenty-four-unit apartment complex on Olean Avenue.  This permit specified a ninety foot by three hundred eighty-four foot foundation for such complex.  Although&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that use was permissible under the pre-amended version of the zoning ordinance, such a use was prohibited after the amendment.  The zoning permit provided that, pursuant to Section 10.6 of the zoning ordinance, the permit would expire six months after its issuance. On May 13, 1980, prior to the effective date of the restrictive amendment, appellants were awarded another zoning permit to construct a forty-eight-unit apartment complex on Melanie Drive.  This permit provided for a foundation, one hundred fifty feet by six hundred one feet.  Like the Olean Avenue site, this apartment complex would cease being a sanctioned use under the amended ordinance.  Also, the zoning permit would terminate in six months. On November 10, 1980, after the permit for Olean Avenue expired, partial footers were poured at each location.  At the Olean Avenue site, the construction commenced consisting of a partial footer, twenty-four feet by eighty-seven feet.  At the Melanie Drive site, a partial footer, measuring twenty-seven feet by one hundred eleven feet, had been installed by such date.  Subsequently, appellants were notified that their zoning permits were no longer effective, and this action ensued. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The property owners raised the following arguments on appeal: (1) that the six-month limitation contained in the zoning permits was invalid; (2) that the courts below applied the incorrect standard to determine whether they had established a lawful nonconforming use; and (3) that an application of the amended version of the zoning ordinance deprived them of vested property rights. The judgment of the court of appeals was affirmed. The court found that in the absence of contrary direction from the general assembly, a zoning ordinance provision, which limited the life of a zoning permit to six months, was a reasonable exercise of the power to zone contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Chapter 519. The court further determined that the proper standard was applied to determine whether the property owners had established a lawful nonconforming use, and that even assuming a more liberal standard applies to amendments as well as the initial passage of the zoning ordinance, that the property owners failed to prove that they were entitled to its protection. Finally, the court held that the property owners failed to show substantial nonconforming use of the property.</SPAN></P>

Paul J. Pschesang, appellant, is the owner of real estate located at 406 Western Avenue, Terrace Park, Hamilton County, Ohio.  Appellant, a dentist, and a partner purchased the land and residential building in 1959 from a medical doctor.  Later, in 1960, appellant purchased the property from his partner. After purchasing the property, appellant used the building for a residence and as an office for his dentistry practice.  In 1966, he abandoned the use as a residence and used the property exclusively as a professional office. The property was zoned &quot;Residence A&quot; (single family) prior to the purchase by appellant and at the time this action was initiated.  When appellant purchased the property, the zoning ordinance permitted the following uses: &quot;(a) In any Residence A District no building, structure, or premises shall be used or arranged or designed to be used in any part except for one or more of the following specified uses: &quot;* * * &quot;3.  The office of a resident physician.&quot; In 1963, the ordinances were revised.  Section 1161.01 of the Codified Ordinances of Terrace Park permitted the continuation and enlargement or structural alteration&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a use which did not conform to the zoning ordinance for the district. In May 1979, appellant filed an application with the zoning inspector for a building permit to expand the premises.  The permit was denied on the ground that appellant's use of the premises was prohibited by the zoning ordinance, Section 1161.01.  On January 25, 1979, the board of zoning appeals affirmed the decision of the building inspector. On August 22, 1979, appellant filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, against appellees, the village of Terrace Park, John Eberhard, building inspector, and William J. Brown, Attorney General.

The dentist filed an application with the zoning inspector for a building permit to expand the premises. The permit was denied on the ground that the dentists' use of the premises was prohibited by the zoning ordinance. The board of zoning appeals affirmed. The trial court, however, found that the ordinance was unconstitutional and ordered the issuance of the requested building permit. The appellate court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that pursuant to both the ordinance and to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 713.15, the dentist's use was illegal when he purchased the property and began using it as a dentist's office.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPEAL from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. This appeal is taken from an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (hereinafter &quot;commission&quot;) granting appellant, the Dayton Power &amp; Light Company (hereinafter &quot;DP&amp;L&quot;), a rate increase in case No. 81-21-EL-AIR.  DP&amp;L filed its application to increase rates for electric service with the commission on April 4, 1981.  The commission designated the period beginning October 1, 1980 and ending September 30, 1981 as the statutory test period and set March 31, 1981 as the date certain.  After public hearings were held, the commission issued an order on February 3, 1982.  The order </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">inter alia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> denied DP&amp;L's requests (1) to include a post-test-year wage adjustment, (2) to allow recovery for installment payments of a one percent gross receipts tax payable after the test year, and (3) to amortize its investment in a cancelled power plant.  DP&amp;L applied for a rehearing on the aforementioned issues, which the commission denied. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">1&nbsp;The commission did grant a limited rehearing in connection with changes in the treatment of investment tax credits prompted by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.  This matter is not, however, before this court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On November 20, 1979, DP&amp;L and the Utility Workers of America entered into an agreement providing for a 7.48 percent wage increase effective October 25, 1981, approximately one month after the designated test year ended.  Appellant sought to adjust the hourly wage rate to be used in calculating its cost of service to reflect the October 25, 1981 wage increase.  The proposed adjustment would have raised the average hourly wage rate from $ 9.76 to $ 10.3194.  The commission denied this adjustment on authority of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consumers' Counsel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Pub. Util. Comm</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 372 [21 O.O.3d 234]. Appellant also requested an adjustment to allow the full recovery of tax payments made pursuant to Am. S.B. No. 448, which imposed a temporary one percent gross receipts tax on utility companies effective January 1, 1981.  The commission had allowed recognition of the one percent gross receipts tax in DP&amp;L's most recent prior rate case, case No. 80-687-EL-AIR, but the rates established in that case were not in effect long enough to allow DP&amp;L to recover the total amount paid pursuant to Am. S.B. No. 448.  In its order the commission overrode its staff's recommendation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12"><SUP>2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and denied rate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  recognition for the balance of one percent temporary tax payments, distinguishing the instant case from case No. 80-687-EL-AIR for the following reasons: &quot;In applicant's prior case, as in those other rate proceedings wherein we approved an allowance for the temporary one percent increase in the gross receipts tax, rate recognition of the increase was clearly required if the rates authorized were to reflect the cost of providing service during the period the rates were to be in effect * * *.  However, the same factors are not at work here, for although the temporary increase was in effect during the test period and a payment at the increased rate was made subsequent to the test period, the obligation to pay the tax at the increased rate has now terminated * * *.  As we have held on so many occasions as to make citation unnecessary, it is not the Commission's function to provide for dollar-for-dollar recovery of specific past expenses, but to provide a reasonable future earnings opportunity.  Accordingly, there should be no allowance in this proceeding for the temporary one percent increase in gross receipts tax imposed by Am. Senate Bill No. 448.&quot; <BR><BR><BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c14">2&nbsp;The staff recommended &quot;that full recovery be allowed but that applicant [appellant] be required to file tariffs containing reduced rates upon full recovery of the one percent increase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In its application for rehearing DP&amp;L argued that the enactment of R.C. 4909.161, effective November 15, 1981, mandated full recovery of the tax payments in question.  The commission declined to modify its order, finding that &quot;the cited statute [R.C. 4909.161] does provide for recovery of certain excise tax increases; but we think it apparent that the legislation cannot logically be interpreted to permit recovery of a tax increase which had expired long before the rates set in this case became effective.&quot; Appellant's application proposed an adjustment providing for the amortization of $ 4,796,000 in expenditures associated with the cancellation of construction of the Killen Generating Station Unit 1 (hereinafter &quot;Killen&quot;).  The commission denied the amortization, citing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Consumers' Counsel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">v.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. Pub. Util. Comm</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 153 [21 O.O.3d 96]. The Office of Consumers' Counsel (hereinafter &quot;OCC&quot;) has been granted leave to intervene as an appellee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant utility company sought review of the decision of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which denied its request for an increase in the hourly wage rate to be used in calculating its cost of service, denied the company's request for an adjustment to allow the full recovery of a temporary tax, and denied the company's request to treat its investment in a cancelled facility as amoritizable costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The utility company's rates were increased after a statutory test period. Thereafter, the company entered into an agreement with a union for an employee wage increase. A temporary tax was also imposed on public utilities. The company requested an adjustment to account for these expenditures, which the Commission denied. The company appealed. The court denied the wage increase adjustment, but partially granted the company's tax adjustment, holding that because one of the tax payments had been made after the passage of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4909.161 the Commission was required to allow the tax adjustment. The company also appealed the Commission's decision refusing to allow the company to amortize the costs of a cancelled facility. The court, however, rejected the company's claims that the Commission's decision resulted in an unconstitutional taking of the company's property. The court held that the proposed amortization would inequitably shift the financial burden of the failed plant from the company's investors to its ratepayers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, and remanded the cause to the Commission for further proceedings to determine the amount of the tax installment payments made by the company.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed and the court reversed, finding that the ordinance provided the requisite fair notice of what behavior was deemed criminal. The city was not required to define every term used in the ordinance, and terms left undefined were to be accorded their common everyday meaning. The court held that the use of the word &quot;neighborhood&quot; in the ordinance gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair warning of what the ordinance proscribed by having it apply to the people living near defendant's place of business.

Richard A. Fowler, Jr., appellant, was indicted on a charge of aggravated burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(3).  Specifically, the indictment alleged that on or about October 13, 1980, appellant and Dave Wilson trespassed in an occupied structure with the purpose to commit a theft offense, and that the occupied structure was the habitation of Lori L. Lanier in Clark County in which at the time of the trespass Lanier was present or likely to be present.  Prior to appellant's trial, Dave Wilson pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.12. Both Lanier and Wilson testified at appellant's trial.  Lanier testified that she and her husband left for work at a Springfield pizza establishment at 3:30 p.m. on October 12, 1980, and did not leave work until 4:30 a.m. on October 13.  When they left work, they did not go straight home but went to a friend's house to play cards.  They returned home at 6:30 a.m., and upon their return, discovered an entry into their home, the bedroom and den ransacked, and various items of property missing including stereo equipment and a microwave oven. Wilson testified that he&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and appellant met at about 9:15 p.m. on the night of the burglary and arrived together at the Lanier home within the hour.  According to Wilson's testimony, prior to their arrival at the Lanier home, Wilson and appellant stopped at a pay telephone, dialed the Lanier home number and left the phone off the cradle.  When they reached the Lanier home and entered the garage, the telephone was still ringing.  Appellant, according to Wilson's testimony, entered the home with a .38 caliber firearm, an automatic &quot;clip-fed&quot; weapon fully loaded with hollow point ammunition designed to &quot;splatter on impact.&quot; Appellant told Wilson &quot;if any body comes through the garage door he [appellant] was going to blow them away.&quot; Upon trial to a jury, appellant was found guilty of aggravated burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(3) and sentenced to a term of five to twenty-five years imprisonment.

The court noted that, although interspousal immunity could have been asserted to protect the husband from liability in an action by his injured wife, the husband's negligent driving continued to be a tortious act and therefore it supported an action in favor of other parties free from the immunity, such as the administrator. The court held that interspousal immunity was personal and did not inhere to the tort itself. Because the wrongful death action was not brought for the benefit of the decedent, any personal immunity existing solely because of the marital relationship was not included in the conditional clause of Ohio Rev.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 24, 1974, Paul J. Nyitray was exposed to carbon dioxide while in the course and scope of his employment with Liquid Carbonic Corporation, an appellee herein, and as a result sustained a myocardial infarction.  Subsequently, he filed a claim with the Bureau of Workers' Compensation.  He was awarded temporary total disability benefits for the period from April 25, 1974 to February 8, 1976.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 15, 1977, Nyitray filed a motion requesting reimbursement for medical bills previously paid and also that the temporary total disability benefits continue from February 1976 to August 1977, and thereafter be contingent upon medical proof.  Hearings were held on the motion and on September 8, 1977 and January 17, 1978, the district hearing officer granted the requests.  Pursuant to the January 1978 order, a warrant in the amount of $9,104 for temporary total disability compensation was issued and mailed to Nyitray.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the industrial injury, Nyitray died on January 29, 1978, prior to receiving the compensation awarded.  Subsequently, the Bureau of Workers' Compensation cancelled the previously&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issued warrant.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 13, 1978, Angela Nyitray, the widow-appellant, filed an application for payment of compensation accrued at the time of her husband's death.  At a hearing on April 17, 1978, the application was granted for fifteen percent permanent partial disability which had been awarded on November 22, 1977 pursuant to a separate claim for an injury to the lumbosacral region of the back.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 7, 1978, appellant filed a motion requesting payment of the temporary total disability compensation and medical bills previously awarded, additional payment of temporary total disability compensation to date of death and also death benefits.  Thereafter, the district hearing officer granted the request for death benefits.  On May 29, 1979, the hearing officer granted reimbursement of medical bills, but, denied the temporary total disability compensation.  Upon appeal, the Toledo Regional Board of Review affirmed the order of May 1979.  The Industrial Commission, appellee herein, refused further appeal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, appellant initiated this action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Industrial Commission to make the award. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The court of appeals denied the writ.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employee was injured during the course of his employment. He was awarded temporary total disability benefits but died prior to receiving them. Subsequently, the bureau of workers' compensation canceled the previously issued warrant. The widow filed an application for payment of compensation that had accrued at the time of her husband's death and for the previous awards of temporary disability and medical bills. The death benefits and medical bills were awarded, but the claim for the benefits associated with the temporary disability was denied. The review board affirmed, and the industrial commission refused further appeal. The widow sought an order that the commission pay her the temporary disability compensation her husband was entitled to receive. The court reversed the denial of the widow's writ because the classification that denied dependents of workers who died from work-related causes from obtaining compensation due, while paying the dependents of workers who died from other causes, was inherently unfair and unconstitutional. There was no danger of &quot;double-dipping&quot; because the employee never received the payment he was entitled to receive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relator-appellant, Donald E. Bloomingdale, brought this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Greene County on February 25, 1980, seeking a declaratory judgment holding as invalid and unenforceable that part of respondent-appellee city of Fairborn's Affirmative Action Plan which codifies a policy of not hiring applicants for city departments in which a relative holds a supervisory position.  Relator had applied in 1975 and 1976 for employment as a police officer in the city of Fairborn police department.  His father was at that time a lieutenant in the department.  Relator placed second on two civil service competitive examinations for the position, and achieved first place on the resultant initial employment eligibility lists following a screening process.  However, relator was passed over by the city, which chose others to fill three vacancies which arose while the eligibility lists were in effect.  The reason given by the city for its refusal to accept relator's application was a &quot;no relatives&quot; policy, in force as part of the Affirmative Action Plan adopted by resolution of the city council.  While the city filled&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  one vacancy with an applicant listed below relator on the initial employment eligibility list, the other two were filled as non-competitive interdepartmental transfers.  Transfers are given preference over persons on initial employment lists, by virtue of a policy ranking &quot;in-house&quot; hiring above outside applicants, as codified in the city's Personnel Rules and Regulations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial court determined that the &quot;no relatives&quot; policy contravened provisions in the city charter and Ohio Constitution which mandate hiring on the basis of merit and fitness.  The court of appeals reversed, finding the policy valid and enforceable.  The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a motion to certify the record.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant job applicant challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Greene County (Ohio), which reversed the trial court's judgment that appellee city's &quot;no relatives&quot; policy contravened provisions of the city charter and Ohio Const. art. XV, &sect; 10. The applicant brought the action to declare the city's policy of not hiring applicants for city departments in which a relative held a supervisory position unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The applicant had twice applied for employment as a police officer in the city's police department. His father was a lieutenant in the department. The applicant placed second on two civil service competitive examinations for the position, and he achieved first place on the initial employment eligibility lists following a screening process. However, he was passed over by the city because of the &quot;no relatives&quot; policy. On appeal, the court held that the &quot;no relatives&quot; policy conflicted with the merit and fitness provision of the city charter, and was, therefore, of no effect. The city charter required all appointments and promotions to be made solely on the basis of merit and fitness. The &quot;no relatives&quot; policy, however, penalized the applicant for a condition over which he had no control. The mere existence of a blood connection acted to deprive the applicant of the impartial evaluation of competence mandated by city charter and precluded consideration of his individual qualifications. By placing at the top of two competitive eligibility lists, relator demonstrated his merit and fitness for the position of police officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court and remanded the case. The court reinstated the judgment of the trial court ordering appointment of the applicant as police officer, provided he passed the required physical examination, and scheduling a hearing for damages.</SPAN></P>

The Geauga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted the petroleum company's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint on the ground that state law preempted the matter. The township appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The petroleum company was going to drill approximately 250 feet from an inhabited dwelling. Drilling that close to an inhabited dwelling violated a local zoning ordinance. The court modified the trial court's judgment to reflect that judgment was granted in favor of the petroleum company. The court stated that the township's general power to prohibit oil and gas wells in certain areas had been preempted by state law on the issue under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509. The court also held that even though Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.39 placed greater restrictions on counties and townships, as compared to municipalities, in that the former could not enact minimum acreage and distance requirements or require a permit or license, it did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. The court noted that the township had failed to set forth any reason why the classifications in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1509.39 were unreasonable. Considering the nature of a municipality as compared to a township or township, it was manifestly reasonable to give the former more latitude in restricting gas and oil wells.</SPAN></P>

The corporation filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the city, which was dismissed by the trial court. On appeal, the court determined that because of the preference of the court for administrative relief, rather than extraordinary injunctive relief, and because the corporation could have fully litigated its statutory and available constitutional challenges in the Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant's dogs, a Rottweiler and an American Pit Bull Terrier, attacked and killed a child.

Defendant was convicted only on the charge of failing to confine the dangerous dogs, and challenged the convicting raising four points of error. The court chose to only discuss defendant's first assignment of error, which provided that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss the charge based on the fact that the statutory structure failed to comport with due process requirements of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The court noted that a statute was unconstitutionally vague where it was not written in such a way that a man of common intelligence could have ascertained what conduct was prohibited and that the law did not provide explicit standards to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The statute in question was unconstitutionally vague as there was no dog &quot;commonly known as a pit bull dog&quot; and an attempt to enforce the statute resulted in very inconsistent determinations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The City passed a resolution that upon their retirement, City employees would not receive any part of their unused sick leave as pay. City of East Cleveland, Ohio, Resolution No. 1767. The officers filed an action against the City that the resolution violated Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.39 which provided that an employee could elect to receive a portion of the unused sick pay. The trial court granted the City's motion for summary judgment and denied the officers' writ of mandamus. The officers appealed and the court reversed and remanded the decision. The court held that the City could not enact a resolution that denied the right to compensation provided for in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.39(B). The court found that the resolution was in direct conflict with the state law. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.39 was a law of general nature, governing a statewide concern, which prevailed over conflicting municipal ordinances. The court concluded that its decision was supported by the supremacy clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 34, that operated to invalidate conflicting legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the stabbing death of his girlfriend. He was committed to a psychiatric institution, and thereafter, was placed on conditional release. The trial court, however, denied defendant's request for discharge, and defendant challenged the decision contending first that it was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The court noted that hospitalization was required for a person found to be mentally ill and who represented a substantial risk of harm to himself or society. Proof of the necessity of hospitalization by the state required clear and convincing evidence. The state failed to present any evidence, much less to prove by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was mentally ill and a threat to himself and others. Therefore, the trial court erred in refusing to discharge him. Because defendant's first assignment of error was sustained, the court declined to discuss his second assignment of error regarding the constitutionality of the confinement statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant allegedly sexually assaulted his friend's 13-year-old daughter while she was trying to sleep. Defendant asserted an alibi defense that he was an hour away at his girlfriend's house when the assault took place. The daughter testified as to what he did to her. Defendant was convicted and sentenced to six months in the reformatory. Affirming, the court held that defendant waived any error regarding overruling his motion for acquittal by presenting a defense and not renewing the motion. The court also found that the motion was properly denied as there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury. The court found that the trial court properly limited cross-examination of the victim and her father because the State had an interest in protecting the victim from undue harassment and testimony as to whether defendant ever had a relationship with the father's wife would have required the trial court to draw an inference.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred in denying the transit authority's motion for a directed finding. In so holding, the court found that 1) the victim failed to set forth any evidence that supported a claim for relief against the transit authority; 2) while the public duty rule was applicable to the transit authority's case, the transit authority had no special duty to the victim; 3) the transit authority waived its right to object to evidence about the prior rape by failing to object at trial; 4) the trial court committed reversible error in admitting the testimony of the former transit authority board member; 5) the trial court erred in holding that the damages limitation in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Toledo Municipal Court (Ohio), which, after a bench trial, found defendant guilty of refusing to remit his city income taxes for 1984 and 1985. Defendant was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment, and the sentence was suspended on the condition that defendant pay the taxes due within 90 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, defendant contended that city income taxes were a debt and that Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 1905.01 et seq. was unconstitutional because it provided a criminal penalty of possible imprisonment for failure to pay a debt. Defendant also contended that the city failed to prove that his nonpayment of the taxes was willful or intentional. As to defendant's first contention, the court found that it was not well taken. The court held that &sect; 1905.01 was not violative of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 15, which forbade imprisonment for debt in any civil action, because a sovereign could impose sanctions, including criminal penalties, for a refusal to pay imposed taxes. Further, the requisite culpable mental state was specified in the ordinance by use of the terms &quot;fail,&quot; &quot;neglect,&quot; and &quot;refuse.&quot; The court, however, reversed the decision because the city failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant's failure to pay his taxes was willful or fraudulent. The only evidence offered as to defendant's intent was a statement that he was &quot;unable&quot; to pay the taxes at the time. Failure to remit payable and due taxes could not, in and of itself, be a basis for imprisoning the debtor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellant property owner sought review of a declaratory judgment entered by the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) in favor of appellee, the City of Toledo, finding that Toledo, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1167.01(b)(13) was constitutionally valid. The trial court had previously dismissed as untimely an administrative appeal of the City's denial of a special use permit under &sect; 1167.01(b)(13) for the owner's addition to its greenhouse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The owner's greenhouse had existed as a nonconforming use in a residential area. Because the addition exceeded the allowable expansion of the nonconforming use, the owner was required to seek a special use permit. The owner claimed that the trial court improperly applied the standard for non-conforming uses to circumvent the vagueness of &sect; 1167.01 and to uphold the constitutionality of &sect; 1167.01 as it related to greenhouses. The court held that &sect; 1167.01, as it was applied to the present facts, was not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate equal protection. The denial of the permit on the grounds of a commercial use of residential streets and illegal parking problems involved a concern for the orderly arrangement of compatible building and land uses and the social and economic welfare of the City. Thus, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. The standard promulgated under &sect; 1167.01(a) was not so incomprehensible as to provide no standard at all. The fact that the City approved a special use permit for another greenhouse was not an equal protection violation where there were sufficient differences between the two greenhouses.</SPAN></P>

As a result of such incident, the employer filed a worker's compensation claim and received compensation. However, the employer filed his personal injury action against the employer alleging the employer intentionally, maliciously, wilfully, and wantonly caused his injuries. On appeal, the court held that the first issue was whether Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80(G)(1) was applicable to the employee's case. Section 4121.80(G)(1) was enacted after the commencement of the employee's case. The court held &sect; 4121.80(G)(1) could not be applied retroactively because it imposed a new more difficult standard for the &quot;intent&quot; requirement of a worker's compensation intentional tort than the standard under common law.
