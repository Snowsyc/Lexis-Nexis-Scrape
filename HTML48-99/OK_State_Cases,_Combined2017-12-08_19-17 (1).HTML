The proceeding concerned notice of a sheriff's sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment debtor's property was sold at a sheriff's sale to satisfy the judgment in this case. Before the sale, notice was printed in a newspaper. The judgment debtor argued that the judgment creditor never gave her notice of the sale though she had lived at the same address for 15 years and was a 40-year customer of the judgment creditor. In an affidavit, the judgment creditor's counsel stated that he sent the judgment creditor notice of the hearing to confirm the sale. The trial court confirmed the sale by order. The judgment debtor filed unsuccessful motions to set aside the sale, to deny a writ of assistance, to dismiss, and to reconsider. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. Though Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 764 (1981), controlled when the sale occurred and only called for notice by publication, such notice violated due process because the judgment debtor's whereabouts were known. Consequently, the order confirming the sale was void and the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter it. In addition, an Oklahoma Supreme Court holding applicable to the sale date mandated personal notice for judicial sales to which &sect; 764 applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant driver sought review of a decision of the District Court of Payne County (Oklahoma), which affirmed the report of appellee Department of Public Safety (DPS) and revoked the driver's license for 90 days following his arrest for driving under the influence. The driver claimed that the report of the officer who administered a breathalyzer test was fatally flawed and that DPS had not met its burden of proof and acquired jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The driver was arrested for speeding, and a police officer arrested him for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. At the police station, another officer signed a report alleging that he had a blood alcohol concentration of .10, and his license was revoked after an administrative hearing. His demurrer to the evidence was overruled by the district court, which gave him limited driving privileges for the final 60 days of the suspension. On review, the court found that the trial court could take judicial notice of the Board of Tests for Alcohol and Drug Influence's rules and regulations, that the officer's failure to facially disclose that he had performed a reference test on the machine could be cured by presenting evidence that a requirement to jurisdiction was met, and that the Board's ordination of testing procedures had jurisdictional implications and required proof at both the administrative and district court levels. The court reversed and ruled that once the driver called into question the substance and existence of the Board's rules, the district court was required to determine what the rules were and whether DPS's evidence showed compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department of Human Services (DHS) filed the paternity complaints against the contestant for the two children, who were seven and five years old. The contestant was granted leave to plead the general a five-year statute of limitations for actions under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 95(sixth) (1981). The trial court dismissed the suit based on the statute of limitations in &sect; 95(sixth). The prior three-year statute of limitations for paternity suits under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 83 (1981) was declared unconstitutional. The revised Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 83 (1985) was passed after the paternity suit was filed, and allowed a paternity action to be filed at any time prior to a child's 18th birthday. The court reversed and remanded the dismissal of the paternity suits, holding that the general five-year limitation was tolled during the children's minority, and thus the revised &sect; 83 (1985) was applicable. A five-year limitation on paternity actions was deemed to be an unconstitutional denial of equal protection to children born out of wedlock, the same as a three-year limitation.</SPAN></P>

Appellee, State of Oklahoma, had filed a petition alleging that the children were deprived children because of abuse by their father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On the day of the dispositional hearing, the father filed a demand for a jury trial. He contended that Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 required a jury trial, if one was requested, for the dispositional hearing. The trial court denied his request. The only issue was whether the father was entitled to a jury trial at the dispositional hearing stage of juvenile proceedings in which the State alleged that children were deprived. The court noted that, when Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 was amended in 1969, Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1110 (1981) was enacted, providing for jury trials in adjudicatory hearings, i.e., hearings to determine whether a child was within the purview of &sect; 1110. The court concluded that neither Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1110 (1981) nor any other statute required a jury trial at a dispositional hearing. The court further concluded that Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 did not require a jury trial in a &quot;dispositional hearing.&quot; The right to a trial by jury applied to the previous &quot;adjudication hearing,&quot; or to a possible subsequent &quot;termination of parental rights&quot; proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court adjudicating the father's children as wards of the court and denying his request for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, the Oklahoma Tax Commission and the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission (ABLE), and others, challenged a decision of the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, in a suit by appellees, a beverage retailers group and others, holding parts of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 501-599 (Supp. 1987), unconstitutional and enjoining the issuing of licenses for and the taxation of mini-bars.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The retailers' group contended that Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 506(11), (19), (27); 518(13); and 521(E), (L), (O), (R), and (T), authorizing hotels to sell alcoholic beverages from mini-bars, were unconstitutional in permitting retail sales of alcoholic beverages in their original sealed packages by other than privately owned and operated package stores. ABLE, the Tax Commission, and appellants-intervenors, two hotel management companies, argued that the Oklahoma Constitution did not reserve retail sales of sealed containers of alcoholic beverages to privately owned and operated package stores. The court reversed the judgment. It held that Okla. Const. art. 28, &sect; 4 authorized retail sales of alcoholic beverages by the individual drink, and did not prohibit the legislature from enacting the statutory scheme at issue and determining that the sale of individual drink-sized bottles from a hotel room mini-bar constituted a sale of alcoholic beverages by the individual drink for on-premises consumption. The court concluded that where it was not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the Constitution expressly prohibited the legislature's action, the actions were presumed to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department revoked a licensee's driver's license under Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 6-205.1(a)(3) and (c) (1989), because he was driving under the influence of intoxicants. The licensee alleged that the order should be modified because it imposed an extreme and unusual hardship on him. He claimed the revocation was unconstitutional because it deprived him of due process. The trial court modified the revocation order based on the extreme and unusual hardship. On appeal, the order was reversed. The court ruled that the licensee had an opportunity to be heard at both the administrative and district court levels concerning the Department's actions. Thus, his procedural due process rights were satisfied. The court held that the Department met its burden of establishing the validity of the revocation; therefore, the revocation period was mandatory and the trial court was without jurisdiction to modify it regardless of extreme and unusual hardship. The court concluded that requiring an unmodifiable revocation after a second offense was not an unreasonable or arbitrary means of promoting the state interest. The case was remanded with instructions to reinstate the Department's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant blood recipient sought review of the judgment from the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which granted summary judgment in favor appellees, a hospital and a blood bank, and denied the recipient's motion for reconsideration. The recipient also challenged the constitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2151.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The recipient tested positive for the Acquired Immuno-deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) virus following blood transfusions he received during surgery. The recipient filed an action against appellees, alleging strict liability, breach of implied warranty and negligence. The recipient argued that appellees failed to properly screen and test the blood. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 2151 neither violated the &quot;special law&quot; prohibition of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 47 nor the due process protection of Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 because the blood shield statute treated all those involved with the transaction of supplying blood equally. Furthermore, the court found that the grant of immunity bore a reasonable relation to the public interest in the maintenance of an adequate blood supply. Regarding the recipient's challenge to the grant of summary judgment, the court held that the trial court properly granted appellee's motion because there was no evidence that appellees breached their duty. The court, however, found that under Okla. R. Civ. P. 2015, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2015 (Supp. 1984), the recipient was able to amend its affidavit to include the new issue of informed consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment in favor of the blood bank. The court affirmed in part the granting the hospital's motion for summary judgment on the issue of negligence, but reversed the grant of summary judgment as to the issue of informed consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The physician occasionally purchased real estate from one of his regular patients.

The personal representative filed a cross-petition for rescission due to undue influence, for damages in lieu of rescission, for conversion, for willful violation of the medical standard of care, and later for medical malpractice. The parties settled the undue influence claim. The trial court entered judgment sua sponte for the physician on the medical malpractice claim, but it later vacated the judgment. Upon the physician's motion, the trial court granted him summary judgment on the medical malpractice claim. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that the physician-patient relationship did not encompass business transactions that resulted in a claim for undue influence.

The Baptists sought review, contending that the licensing requirement was unconstitutional as applied to churches. On review, the court noted that the Baptists' admissions of their failure to obtain the required license, and of their intent not to obtain the required license, were a clear violation of the Oklahoma Statutes. The court noted that the question of whether a state statute violates U.S. Const. amend. I's free exercise clause was a question of law properly decided by summary judgment. Using the appropriate balancing test, the court held that the district attorney had a compelling interest in protecting the children in child care facilities. Further, the court held that the interest outweighed the burden imposed upon the Baptists by the licensing requirements.

The paver purchased the stones from the supplier and installed them. The development paid the paver but not the supplier. The supplier argued that &sect; 142.1 did not apply to corporate property. The development claimed that under its bylaws, it held the property in trust for the individual owners who were thus the beneficial owners of the common areas. As beneficial owners of the common areas, they claimed they were entitled to the &sect; 142.1 notice. The court disagreed and found that neither the corporate declaration nor the bylaws created a trust. No trust instrument was filed of record. Title to the common areas was held solely by the development. None of the individual homeowners had a deed or other instrument granting them any individual interest in the development property. The court found that the legislature clearly limited the protection of &sect; 142.1 to owner occupied dwellings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found no compelling state interest that justified the appointment of a conservator over the property of a mentally competent citizen against his will. The conservatorship statute deprived the conservatee of his constitutionally protected right to enjoy the gains of his own labor, as well as prohibiting him from contracting except for necessities. Further, the exercise of the power to hold a law to be invalid because of its conflict with the Constitution was the ultimate and supreme function of courts. It was true that a strong presumption existed in favor of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment; however, there was an exception in cases involving the rights, privileges, and immunities of the citizen. Where it was proposed by a statute to deny or diminish a right secured to the people by an explicit constitutional provision, the presumption was against the validity of the statute.&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 58, &sect; 890.1 et seq.

The worker then made an offer of proof which consisted of a showing that he first became aware of the fact that his lung problem was job-related when he was told such was the case by a doctor on December 20, 1985. The claim was filed two weeks after that date. The trial court denied the worker's claim for compensation after it found that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court felt that any claim filed after two years was barred as a matter of law.

Reversing, the court held that the employee's claim was governed by the statute of limitations in effect at the time of his injury, Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 43(A) (1981), as supplemented by the &quot;awareness doctrine,&quot; which required an employee to be aware of his injury and the causal relationship between the injury and his employment.

Trial court entered judgment for county clerk in an action brought by a homebuilding company for a declaratory judgment that it was not required to purchase documentary tax stamps for sheriff's deeds obtained by it and for the refund of all taxes unlawfully levied by the county clerk.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The builder contracted with landowners to build homes on unimproved land and took mortgages on the land as security for the contract price. When a mortgagor failed to make required payments, the builder obtained a foreclosure judgment for the amount of money due on the contract and bid that amount when the property was sold at a sheriff's sale. If the builder was the successful bidder, the property was conveyed to him by sheriff's deed. When such a deed was recorded, the county clerk required that a documentary stamp tax be paid pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 5101 (1981). The builder filed an unsuccessful action for a declaratory judgment that the tax was not applicable, and sought a refund. On appeal, the court found that the transaction constituted a sale, and was therefore subject to the documentary stamp tax. The court noted that the builder, as mortgagee, by accepting the deed in satisfaction of its judgment, surrendered an asset valued at the face value of its judgment. This asset, the judgment, was surrendered as the consideration for the deed from the sheriff and constituted valuable consideration. Therefore, the court found that every requirement of a sale was met.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation's agent operated a booth on a Sunday at a county's fairgrounds for the sale of contracts to breed with certain famous stallions. The horse breeder paid $ 20,000 for two breeding contracts. The next day, the corporation repudiated the contracts. The breeder sued for $ 30,000. The trial court denied the corporation's motions for directed verdicts, and entered a jury award of $ 30,000 in favor of the breeder. On appeal by the corporation, the court affirmed. The court held that the Oklahoma Sabbath Breaking statute contained at Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 908 did not render the contracts unenforceable. As a criminal statute,&nbsp;&sect; 908 must be strictly construed, and it did not prohibit the breeder from buying or contracting to buy anything, and did not prohibit the corporation from selling or contracting to sell horse breedings or any other services. Further, there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that the market value of the breedings for which the breeder contracted was $ 50,000; therefore, the breeder proved he suffered damages. Finally, the evidence supported a finding that the agent acted with the corporation's authority.</SPAN></P>

The decision granted a right of participation in the production company's development of a oil and gas well that was based on pooling in a drilling and spacing unit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission issued a forced pooling order that included common sources of oil and gas supply in a section. The order designated the production company as the wells' operator. The exploration corporation received an assignment of a leasehold interest in the section. The corporation received a lease of the section. The production company refused to allow the corporate appellees to participate in pooling. The court reversed the contested decision because the Commission failed to comply with the pooling statute of Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 87.1(e) (1981). The court ruled that tit. 52, &sect; 87.1 was restrictive and required pooling by the drilling and spacing unit, rather than by the wellbore. The Commission lacked authority to interpret the order to force pooling by the wellbore. The court concluded that the decision did not have a fair and reasonable impact because it deprived the original risk capital investors of their property rights. Therefore, the decision constituted a violation of substantive due process under the Oklahoma Constitution and the U.S. Constitution. The court ruled that the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction when it made a finding regarding the production company.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 42-101 through 42-115 (1981) contained clear guidelines and safeguards to avoid and check judicial encroachment on municipal legislative control of streets and public easements. Evidence that the street easement had never been used by the public and was in a condition that rendered it a nuisance supported the trial court's finding that vacation of the easement would not injuriously affect the rights of the public or of owners of other portions of the plat.

Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 60.6 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the father and the mother divorced the father was ordered to pay $ 200 per month in child support, but the father only submitted $ 120 over a 30-month period. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of willful failure to contribute to the support of the minor child under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 60.6. The father reported several instances of unemployment, but also reported that he received $ 4000 per month from one of his jobs. The father remarried, purchased a home, and was able to feed, house and clothe his other two children and his wife. Yet, the father did not submit any child support payments for 15 months straight. Even if the father had an agreement to assume the mother's $ 300 credit card debt, that was insufficient to substantially comply with the statute. The evidence failed to support the father's charge that he set up a trust fund for the minor child. A savings account with $ 200 was set up, but it was not mentioned to anyone. The court concluded that &sect; 60.6 was constitutional because the statute aimed to protect children from harm, was narrowly drawn, and required clear and convincing evidence of willful failure.</SPAN></P>

Action by one child against seven brothers and sisters to quiet title to one-eighth of their grandfather's estate.  By will the grandfather gave his estate to his only child (the mother of the parties) for life, and at her death the remainder to her &quot;living children.&quot; Defendants contested plaintiff's claim on ground she was born to their mother out of wedlock and therefore could not be one of devisee's &quot;living children.&quot; Trial court granted plaintiff summary relief.

Defendants were all the products of connubial relations between the mother and one or the other of her two husbands. Defendants claimed that because plaintiff was &quot;illegitimate&quot; she was not a child as intended by their grandfather in disposing of the remainder of his estate by will. In affirming the judgment the court held that a judicial determination of heirship made in connection with the probate of the grandfather's will was not binding on plaintiff, who had received no notice of and was not a party to that proceeding. The court next held that there was no evidence that the grandfather intended to exclude non-connubial persons from his testamentary gift to his daughter's children. In so holding the court noted that illegitimacy was an archaic and largely repudiated legal concept. The court also held that Okla. Stat. tit. 84, &sect; 215 (1951), which before amendment governed the inheritance rights of an illegitimate child, had violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 60.6(3) (1981). Appellant father sought review of an order from the District Court of Garfield County (Oklahoma), which found that his minor child was eligible for adoption without his consent because he wilfully failed, refused, or neglected substantially to comply with the support order in a divorce decree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The child's parents were divorced in 1980. The decree ordered the father to pay $ 200 per month for child support. He made two payments totaling $ 120 in three years. The father admitted that since the divorce he supported his two children by his current wife, who did not work, and that although he was sometimes unemployed, he usually earned $ 4,000 per month. The father claimed the evidence with respect to his wilful failure, refusal, or neglect to contribute to his child's support was insufficient under the clear and convincing standard and that &sect; 60.6(3) was unconstitutional. Affirming the judgment, the court found that the evidence was sufficient. The court held that &sect; 60.6(3) was substantively constitutional because its ultimate goal was to protect children from harm caused by their parents' neglect or intentional actions, it was narrowly drawn, the evidence of willful failure to provide support had to be clear and convincing, and a child's right to continuous care in a stable, permanent home environment outweighed the father's right to grant consent for adoption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The leases in dispute were concluded prior to July 1, 1982, and contained a surface damage clause that limited the lessee's liability to damages caused by its operations to growing crops on the land.

Despite the lease terms, the trial court refused to limit the damages the jury could award, and the lessee appealed the judgment rendered. In reversing the judgment the court held that the Act did not apply retrospectively. Because the Act was effective on July 1, 1982, these leases were not subject to it. The court noted that Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 318.7 (Supp. 1982) unambiguously indicated that the Act had would not impair existing contractual rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers filed an action against the county treasurer and associated individuals to obtain a refund of a portion of ad valorem taxes that they paid to the county. The taxpayers alleged that one of the associated individuals, the county assessor, arbitrarily increased the fair cash value of their various properties and that they received no notice of the reevaluation and did not know of it until they received tax statements toward the end of the year. When the taxpayers complained to the Board of Tax Roll Corrections of Tulsa County, the Board denied them relief on the ground that it lacked statutory authority to grant redress because the assessed valuation had not been increased. The taxpayers alleged that the valuation increase was void for lack of notice. The school district was allowed to intervene in the action. The lower court granted a summary judgment in favor of the school district, county treasurer, and associated individuals. On review, the court vacated and remanded. The court held that a notice of increased valuation of the property by the assessor was mandatory pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2460 (1981).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The government alleged that the constructive notice provisions in Okla.

The court reversed the district court's judgment and remanded the action with orders to vacate the mortgagee's tax resale deed and to direct the county treasurer to begin new proceedings to enforce its tax lien under the condition that the Government receive actual notice of the proceeding, concluding that precedent established that the Government's recorded security interest in the parcel entitled it to actual notice of the pending tax sale. The court also reasoned that precedent showed that notice by publication and posting did not provide a mortgagee with adequate notice of a proceeding to sell the mortgaged property for a tax delinquency.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The sole question in the appeal was whether constructive notice to a mortgagee, holder of a validly executed and recorded mortgage, of tax sale of the mortgaged property for delinquent taxes was sufficient to comply with due process of law. The purchaser was the buyer of property at the tax sale. The trial court rejected the challenge and quieted title to the property in the purchaser. The court found that the mortgagee could predict with absolute accuracy the date at which taxes were due, whether they had been paid and when and if a tax resale would be held to pay the delinquent taxes. The county treasurer was not required to search the county clerk's records to determine the names of the owners of the land. Thus, the court did not think it would require the county treasurer to search the county clerk's records to determine the names of the mortgagees of the property subject to tax sale or resale. The Oklahoma resale tax sale procedures afforded adequate notice and due process where the land was correctly described in the notices and the statutory procedures were specifically followed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee commenced a routine pooling proceeding regarding certain oil and gas interests. Appellant chose not to attend the hearing, and the Commission ordered appellant to relinquish its working interest to appellee for a reserved overriding royalty equaling 1/16 of 7/8 of all oil and 1/8 of 7/8 of all gas, said fractional overriding royalty to be reduced, however, to absorb any existing non-operating interests in excess of the normal 1/8th lessor's royalty. Appellant did not seek a rehearing, and 69 days after the date of the order appellant filed a motion to require the taking of additional evidence with the Supreme Court. Appellant's motion was denied, and appellant challenged the Commission's order on the basis that it was an unconstitutional taking. The court reversed and held that the order of the Commission deprived appellant of its property without substantive due process of law. The court held that Commission exceeded its statutory authority under Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 87.1(e) (1981) by disturbing the rights to the overriding royalty interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant insurers sought review of a post-appeal attorney's fee award to appellee insured as the prevailing party, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 3629B (1981), that was entered by the District Court of Cleveland County, Oklahoma, in an insurance action. The award was granted in response to the insured's motion for attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The primary issue raised by the insurers was whether the trial court had jurisdiction to assess attorney's fees as costs, following disposition of the appeal, in response to the insured's motion for fees as a prevailing party. The court ruled that the trial court did have jurisdiction to award fees under &sect; 3629B. In so ruling, the court rejected the insurers' argument that the insured never made the awarding of fees an issue prior to the filing of the appellate opinion. The court noted that the question of whether the insured was entitled to fees as the prevailing party could not have been known until after the identity of the prevailing party became known. The court also rejected the argument that &sect; 3629 was unconstitutional because nothing was said about attorney's fees in the title of the statute, as required by Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57. The court found that the &quot;title&quot; relied upon for the argument was merely a heading supplied by the legal publisher. The actual title to Okla. Stat. tit. 36, &sect; 3629 (1981), however, indicated that the statute addressed costs to prevailing parties. The court found that this language was sufficiently clear to satisfy Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's award of attorney's fees to the insured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The school districts sought a declaratory judgment, alleging that the county treasurer had invested ad valorem taxes paid under protest and that the interest earned on the school districts' share of the distributed funds should have been distributed along with its portion of the principal. The trial court found that the county treasurer had commingled the taxes with other funds, and ordered all the interest earned to be credited to the school districts. On appeal, the judgment was vacated and remanded. The court held that the fact that the treasurer wrongfully commingled the funds paid under protest did not change the character of the funds. The taxes paid under protest were to be treated as a distinct fund separate from the general funds of the county until the final determination of the protest. The court ruled that under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2467(b) (1971), it was the treasurer's duty to apportion the entire fund, both principal and interest, to the various entities entitled to the fund after the final determination of the protest had been made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff widow filed an action against defendants, a clinic, a hospital, and surgeons, alleging medical malpractice and product liability arising from the death of her husband during heart surgery. The District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma) entered judgment in favor of defendants based upon the statute of limitations, Okla. Stat. tit. 76, &sect; 18 (1981), and other reasons, and the widow appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The widow's husband was referred by a clinic doctor to the surgeons, who performed surgery on him at the hospital. The widow claimed that the surgeons and hospital fraudulently concealed the true cause of her husband's death and that it was only through the personal intervention by a former congressman that she learned that her husband died because the heart-lung machine allegedly forced air instead of blood into his aorta. On appeal, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 76, &sect; 18 (1981) did not abrogate the discovery rule holding that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the patient learned, or, in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, should have learned the true circumstances surrounding the death or injury giving rise to the complaint. The court held unconstitutional that part of &sect; 18 purporting to limit recovery to medical expenses when the medical action was brought three years after the injury. Thus, the court held whether the statute of limitations was tolled by the conduct of the hospital and surgeons, in light of their affirmative duty to disclose the true facts, and whether the clinic supplied the defective machine were questions for the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and ordered the cause reinstated for trial on its merits against the hospital and surgeons and for further proceedings and trial on the merits regarding whether the clinic supplied the allegedly defective equipment. The court taxed the costs of appeal equally against defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A worker was severely injured on the job when he came into contact with a high voltage electrical line. He sued defendant truck company for negligence and settled with its liability carrier and the compensation insurer. The parties could not agree on the division of the fund and the worker applied to the trial court for apportionment under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 44 (1978). The trial court prorated the insurer's subrogated claim 50-50 with the worker. On appeal, the insurer claimed that he was entitled to the entire amount and the worker claimed that his medical expenses should not have been considered in the division of the fund. The court reversed and remanded, holding that &sect; 44 was reasonably applied and the insurer's substantial and inalienable right to subrogation was not denied. The insurer's subrogation rights were conferred by &sect; 44, which referred only to compensation. The court ruled that a plain reading of &sect; 44 excluded medical expenses from the definition of compensation and thus, could not be considered by the court in apportioning the claim. The court concluded that medical expenses were a primary obligation of furnishing medical expenses imposed on the employer.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that a causal connection existed between the claimant trying to pick up his final paycheck and the battery, noting that there was evidence that he was expressly lured to the job site to allow a confrontation. The court also held that the compensation court's findings adequately supported the award and that there was no requirement that each claimed injury be addressed, noting that unadjudicated injuries were subject to later disposition. The court further determined that the statutory interest under &sect; 3.6(A), (B) was not excessive given the current interest rates and that the statute was a general law because it established a reasonable classification of persons, entities, or things that shared the type of situation or circumstance that rationally related to a valid legislative aim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The builder sued the commission and sought injunctive and declaratory relief.

On appeal by the builder and the commission, the court reversed. The court held that the property owners had the burden of showing that they had a sufficient interest in the litigation to warrant their being made parties hereto. The court held that the property owners failed to make the requisite showing and that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting intervention in the action. The property owners' interest in the constitutionality of &sect; 7.10 of the applicable zoning regulations, as a valid zoning regulations, was a public interest shared by all other people subject to the jurisdiction of the board.

The trial court dismissed the previous action after finding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the foreign corporation. Subsequently, the trucking company filed another breach of warranty action against the trucking company in the same trial court, based on the same set of facts. The trial court dismissed the action, holding that the prior adjudication of the personal jurisdiction issue barred the subsequent suit. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal. The court held that although a dismissal of an action for want of personal jurisdiction over a defendant did not preclude litigation of an action before a trial court of proper jurisdiction, it did preclude relitigation of the question of the trial court's jurisdiction at the time its previous decision was made. Accordingly, the court concluded that the trial court properly dismissed the trucking company's action because it was an attempt to relitigate the issue of personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Purchasers of land entered into a contract with a development company to buy a parcel of land. At the time, the development company had bought that parcel and adjoining parcels from a public utility, paying no down payment, with the public utility holding a mortgage on the land. The development company went bankrupt, and purchasers found themselves holding no title at all. They then filed suit, seeking their purchase payments back plus attorney fees. Since the development company had gone under, the only parties left to sue were the public utility plus four individuals involved in the now-bankrupt development company. All five defendants moved for summary judgment, and all five defendants saw that motion granted. Purchasers appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the public utility but reversed as to the four individuals. With respect to the public utility, the averments made failed to establish a causal nexus between the public utility's actions (assuming they were wrongful) and purchasers' damages. With respect to the individuals, however, material factual disputes remained, and the complaint stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner applied for a building permit so he could remodel and enlarge his home. The city declined to issue the permit unless the owner agreed to convey a strip of land that abutted the street and give the city an easement over the rear of his property. The owner refused and the permit was denied. The trial court issued a peremptory writ commanding defendants to issue the permit. Defendants argued the remedy of mandamus was unavailable to the owner and that the trial court erred in holding unconstitutional Bethany, Okla., Code of Ordinances &sect; 19-7.1D, which required the dedication of an easement without compensation on the particular street on which the owner's residence was located. The court affirmed the issuance of the writ of mandamus and the refusal to award attorney's fees. The city ordinance was void because it required the taking of private property without just compensation. Mandamus was a proper remedy because the issuance of a permit was a ministerial duty and the exhaustion of administrative relief was not required. The court reversed the refusal to award the owner damages because Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1460 (1971) mandated the recovery of damages sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The developers filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that the floodway ordinance was invalid and unenforceable because the City did not give notice under Okla.

The developers requested that the trial court declare the floodway zoning of their property unconstitutional, that the City be enjoined from enforcing its flood regulations, and that they be allowed inverse condemnation damages for a taking of their property for a public use without just compensation. The trial court held that the developers were barred from asserting their constitutional defense because they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The court found that the City's notice complied with Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 404 (1971), which was sufficient because there was no evidence that a protest to the adoption of the floodway ordinance was filed. However, the trial court erred in holding that the developers were barred from raising the defense that the enforcement of the ordinance was unconstitutional because they failed to exhaust administrative remedies. In the court's view, the developers' course of action was sanctioned by Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1396 (1971).</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed from the District Court, Garfield County, Oklahoma, after the city's motion for summary judgment was granted and he was enjoined from running a salvage yard in the city without a license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Ordinances regulated the operation of salvage yards within the city and required these businesses to have a license. Although the operator was licensed under prior regulations, he had not obtained a license under the Ordinances. He argued that the Ordinance could not be retrospectively applied to him. This argument had no merit because the Ordinances applied only to acts occurring after their enactment. The Ordinances were enacted pursuant to the city's police power to promote the public health and welfare. Accordingly, uses of property, businesses, and individuals could be regulated. Courts were discouraged from declaring municipal regulations so enacted unless the regulations clearly infringed upon rights secured by fundamental law. The trial court was correct in prohibiting the operator from running the salvage yard without first obtaining a license. Further, the Ordinances were not unconstitutional. The operator's equal protection rights were not violated because the Ordinances affected all salvage yard operators. There was no error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Service was effected on the bonding company's appointed agent pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 137 (1971). The sheriff and the deputies were served in Osage County pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 154 (1971). In considering the owners' appeal of the quash order, the court ruled that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 143 was constitutional. The statute gave no preference to any particular venue and forbid courts from doing so. The statute gave the owners the right to choose an authorized venue, and bestowal of such a privilege on a party had no constitutional impediment. By passing the statute, the legislature impaired the right of a defendant to be sued in the county of his residence, and it gave a plaintiff the right to choose from among several permissible venues. Once that right was exercised, courts had no right to arbitrarily vitiate it. The court also rejected defendants' argument that the action was not rightly brought in Oklahoma County as required by &sect; 154 because they were public officials. They were validly served in another county because they were jointly liable with the bonding company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In their action, plaintiffs alleged that the injuries received in a car-pedestrian accident involving a city patrol car were caused by the negligence of the police officer acting within the scope and course of his employment. The city claimed that plaintiffs failed to comply with the Government Tort Liability Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 1751 et seq., as to notice and the commencement of the action. The court concluded that the trial court erred in overruling the city's demurrer. The court held that the apparent conflict between Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 96, which tolled the running of the statute of limitations against a minor, and the Act posed no particular problem for the Act applied only to actions that might be maintained under its special provisions, and which would not otherwise exist. Thus, minors and adults were accorded the same treatment by the terms of the Act. The court further held that there was no constitutional provision, either national or state, that required otherwise. Accordingly, as plaintiffs did not comply with the necessary conditions precedent under the Act in order to sue the city in tort, the city did not waive its sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed a trial court conclusion that the first year of employment did not count in determining the teacher's tenure under Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 6-122 (1974). The tenure provisions of the statutes concerning education made no distinction between full-time and part-time teachers, and the court found nothing in any such statute, or in any persuasive policy, which required a teacher to work full days in order to attain tenure. The court also held that there was no foundation for the district's claim that, because it had nothing to do with annexation of the dependent district, which had voted to annex itself to the district, the teacher was not entitled to credit for his years of teaching in the dependent district. Accordingly, the teacher had accumulated four years toward tenure that the district was bound to honor under &sect; 6-122.1, and it was irrelevant that a portion of the teacher's salary was paid from federal funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The daughter of appellee and her husband, who was the son of administrator, owned a parcel of land as joint tenants. After an altercation, the daughter shot and killed her husband and was convicted of the crime of manslaughter in the first degree. The daughter conveyed the jointly-held realty to her father after the criminal charge had been filed against her. The administrator claimed ownership of one-half the property, a lien on the balance in the amount of the proceeds of a credit life insurance policy on the victim's life, and another lien in the amount of a home improvement loan that had been repaid by the estate. The issue on appeal was the interpretation and applicability of the Oklahoma Slayer's statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 84, &sect; 231 (1971). The court noted that, at the time the daughter took her husband's life, the statute contained no reference to a surviving joint tenant; however, the legislature later amended the statute. Although the amendment did not affect the substantive rights of the parties, the father had no greater rights in the property than his daughter, who held the property in a constructive trust for the estate of her murdered husband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Following the accident, an investigating officer administered a blood alcohol content test to the driver of the oncoming vehicle. The results of the test indicated that the driver of the oncoming vehicle was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. The trial court refused to admit the results of the blood test in the passenger's personal injury action, based on the statutory prohibition set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 752 (1971). The jury returned a verdict in favor of the driver of the oncoming vehicle and the trial court entered judgment accordingly. On review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for a new trial. In reaching its decision, the court held that the shield provided by &sect; 752 could not be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense free from the risk of confronting inconsistent blood test rests. Thus, the court concluded that the driver of the oncoming vehicle waived his right to claim the benefit of the statute, because his testimony that he only consumed a couple of beers prior to the accident was clearly false in light of the results of the blood alcohol content test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The development company wanted to expand its shopping center to include eight adjoining lots. Because the lots were zoned for residential use, it had to apply to the city for a rezoning classification.

The trial court held that the city's action was arbitrary and capricious, in that the denial had no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not need the full text of the commercial zoning ordinance in order for it to hold that the company should be allowed to build on the property in compliance with the ordinance. The court examined the &quot;fairly debatable&quot; rule in determining whether the residential zoning ordinance had a reasonable factual foundation. It held that the city council's action in enforcing the residential zoning ordinance was arbitrary and capricious because the facts supported only one non-debatable conclusion, that the refusal to rezone the lots to commercial was unreasonable.

The court found that their function was not legislative, but advisory. Thus, the residence requirement did not apply. Second, the court found that the landowners' complaint was not ripe.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The wife sought a divorce on the grounds of incompatibility and of extreme cruelty. The parties reached a settlement and a decree of divorce was entered. The order was vacated and the trial court issued a divorce decree. The court affirmed, as modified. The court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant the wife the divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty because the trial court was justified in finding one incident did not have the effect of destroying the legitimate ends of matrimony, but was simply a surfacing manifestation of a more deeply rooted marital problem which constituted incompatibility. The trial court erred when it awarded child support for the parties' 19-year-old son because adulthood was bestowed upon males and females at age 18, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 13 (1972). Therefore, the award for the son was void. The court increased the amount awarded to the daughter by the same amount that was voided. The court held that the wife received more than an equitable and fair share of the jointly acquired property.

The landowners appealed, contending that the trial court erred in taking the property without a hearing and that the taking was unconstitutional. The court held that a condemnation decision that adjudicated the right to condemn was a final order. Neither the order giving the plaintiff occupation of the property nor the denial of the motion to vacate constituted an adjudication of the plaintiff's right to condemn the property. However, there would never be trial except on the question of the amount of the damages. Consequently, the landowner's challenge of the right to condemn on constitutional grounds came too late. If the landowners had raised the objection properly, there would have been a right to a hearing on all aspects of the plaintiff's right of condemnation.

After a hearing, the commission recommended that the area be zoned for agriculture use, but created an exception for the tract and instead zoned it for mining. The board adopted such recommendation except as to the tract. Under the zoning ordinance adopted, the tract was left within the general agricultural zone. The company claimed that the ordinance was invalid, as it prevented the company from removing minerals owned by it. The court affirmed the judgment, as the evidence supported it. The company suffered no great hardship that was not preventable. It was warned before it began mining the tract that area landowners might object. Also, the company had an opportunity to be heard before the commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The son collided with and killed an expensive horse owned by his father. The father urged Oklahoma to reject the doctrine of &quot;intrafamily immunity&quot; or at least as it would apply to torts to personal property. Second, the father challenged the constitutionality of the controlling statute at the time the cause of action arose, Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 13 (1971), which made minors females under 18 years and males under 21 years. The court's finding that &sect; 13 prior to amendment was unconstitutional rendered the intrafamily immunity issue immaterial. The court agreed &sect; 13 was violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Section 13, as indicated, defined minors, thus entitling them to certain rights, powers, privileges and immunities, and classified them by sex. Such classification was subject to scrutiny under the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution and was clearly an unreasonable and arbitrary classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an action to quite title, defendants sought review of a decision of a special judge of the District Court, Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which rendered judgment for plaintiff quieting his title to the land involved. A second special judge of the district court overruled defendants' motion to vacate the original judgment. Defendant argued lack of jurisdiction and error in refusing to hold that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 124 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The questions before the court were whether a special judge of the district court had jurisdiction to try a quiet title action, and to rule on a subsequent motion to vacate the original judgment. Plaintiff argued that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 124 was not authorized by Okla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 8 and was, therefore, unconstitutional. Defendants, on the other hand, contended that the full extent of the jurisdiction of special judges was prescribed by Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 123, and, therefore, any purported expansion by Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 124 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court, noting that neither party objected before trial to the case being heard on its merits by a special judge nor to a special judge hearing the first motion to vacate the original judgment, stated that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 124 was not prohibited by the Oklahoma Constitution, either expressly or by implication, and that it was not limited by Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 123A, which was a part of the same legislative enactment. The court stated that there was no question that the district court was the proper forum and had jurisdiction of the subject matter and that the special judge was a judge of that court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Following plaintiff's arrest for an unpaid traffic ticket, plaintiff brought a false imprisonment action against the city pursuant to the Act. When the trial court found for plaintiff, the city sought review, contending that the Act was a special law in violation of Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; 46, 59. In support of its contention, the city claimed that the Act, which only applied to Oklahoma's two most populous cities, contained an arbitrary and capricious classification. In rejecting the city's contention, the court held that the Act's restriction to the two most populous cities had not created an unconstitutional special law. In so holding, the court noted that: (1) the Act did not prescribe a restricted upper limit on population; (2) the category was neither irrational nor unrelated to achieving a legitimate legislative objective; (3) counties with larger populations had different problems than sparsely populated counties; and (4) the courts were not at liberty to substitute their notions of proper population classification absent a clear showing of legislative capriciousness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff landowners challenged an order of the District Court of Osage County (Oklahoma), which sustained a demurrer by defendants, a City and a zoning board, and dismissed the landowners' action under the Oklahoma Declaratory Judgment Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect;&sect; 1651-1657 (1971), on the ground that there was no actual controversy. The landowners had sought a declaration that an airport zoning ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowners had property in the zoned area. The court found that, even though they had not yet used the property in any manner inconsistent with the airport zoning ordinance, the ordinance operated as a legal restriction upon the property in the same manner as an easement would. The court concluded that landowners who claimed a decreased value in their property due to a zoning ordinance had a present, not a potential, dispute with defendants as to the general invalidity of the ordinance. Defendants also claimed that there was a nonjoinder of parties. The court held that, despite the word &quot;shall&quot; in Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1653 (1971), the joinder requirement was not mandatory in the sense that all parties who might be affected by a declaration had to be joined. It was only necessary to join those directly affected by the action. Thus, the beneficial owner of the airport property was not a necessary party because the City was a sufficient protagonist of the validity of the ordinance. Further, the landowners purported to bring a class action, and the averments were sufficient to withstand the demurrer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner, a judicial officer, filed an application for a writ of prohibition asking the court to assume jurisdiction and to prohibit respondent, the Oklahoma Trial Division of the Court on the Judiciary, from proceeding further in the suit filed by the State of Oklahoma to remove the officer from office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On the basis of the findings of the Council on Judicial Complaints submitted to the Attorney General, the State filed a petition seeking the officer's removal. The court found that Okla. Const. art. VII-A, &sect; 4(a) provided that the trial court's jurisdiction could be invoked by a petition filed by any of six different officers or bodies and that it gave the named officers, including the Attorney General, discretionary authority to invoke the trial court's authority. The court further found that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 1659 (Supp. 1974) appeared to make it mandatory for the Attorney General to file a petition invoking the trial court's jurisdiction when directed to do so by the Council. The court also found that the Oklahoma Constitution purposely limited the group that could invoke the trial court's jurisdiction and that it could not be enlarged nor could the discretion of the group be limited by legislative action. The court, therefore, concluded that &sect; 1659 was unconstitutional insofar as it imposed a mandatory duty on the Attorney General to file a petition invoking the jurisdiction of the trial court when directed to do so by the Council.</SPAN></P>
