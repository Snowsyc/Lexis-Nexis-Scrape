Prior to the judgment of divorce, defendant was injured at work and was permanently disabled. Defendant received accidental disability retirement benefits. The court awarded plaintiff one-half of defendant's monthly benefits. Defendant appealed, arguing that the compensation was for lost income and was to be considered only in determining alimony and support. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding plaintiff one-half of defendant's entire monthly benefits. Defendant demonstrated that the benefits were intended at least in part to compensate for his lost earning capacity and pain and suffering. To the extent that the benefits compensated defendant for his lost earning capacity and suffering, they were defendant's separate property and were not subject to an equitable property distribution, but were only available to determine support and alimony obligations.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court reversed and remanded, concluding that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the classroom. An employee's expectation of privacy was assessed in the context of the employment relation. The classroom was not defendant's personal space. It was in a school, and many people had access to it. Accordingly, the classroom was not a place where defendant could reasonably expect to be safe from surveillance and, therefore, not a private place under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 644:9. Since, even under the federal standard of reasonable expectation of privacy, defendant would not have standing, application of that standard to the state constitution was not considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court's decision, plaintiffs, five school districts, five students, and eight taxpayers and parents, filed a motion for attorney's fees and costs for prevailing in the liability phase of the case. Defendant state failed to object. The trial court granted costs, and deferred consideration of fees. Defendant moved to reconsider the award of costs, and raised the defense of sovereign immunity with respect to both costs and fees. The court held that sovereign immunity barred the award of costs, pursuant to N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 23. However, an award of attorney's fees was granted, under the substantial benefit theory. Plaintiffs contributed to the vindication of important constitutional rights, and the purpose of the fee award was not to penalize defendant, but rather to compensate plaintiff towns for their efforts on behalf of the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Award of costs reversed, because such an award was barred by sovereign immunity; but attorney fees awarded, because plaintiffs contributed to the vindication of important constitutional rights, and it was the general public that would have had to pay the fees incurred if the general public had brought the suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile appealed from the Concord District Court (New Hampshire), which adjudicated the juvenile as delinquent after a bench trial for possessing a dangerous weapon at the time of his arrest in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:15 (1994) (amended 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile appealed his adjudication of delinquency for possessing a dangerous weapon at the time of his arrest. The juvenile argued that the adjudication of delinquency for possession of a dangerous weapon at the time of arrest needed to be reversed because the police had custody of the reinforced coin rolls at the time of his arrest, not the juvenile. The juvenile also contended that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:15 (1994) (amended 1998) was unconstitutional because it did not sufficiently notify him that &quot;other dangerous weapons&quot; included reinforced coin rolls. The court affirmed the judgment. The statute's requirement was satisfied because the juvenile &quot;possessed&quot; the reinforced coin rolls at the time he was detained and his detention ripened into a formal arrest in one, unbroken chain of events. The statute gave the juvenile adequate warning that the instrument was a dangerous weapon within the meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held the bill constitutional since it was supported by just reasons, promoted the public welfare, and was uniformly applied within each taxing district. The bill made the exemption available to all utility property located in the state and was not an unconstitutional gift to a corporation. N.H. Const. part I, art. 10 which guaranteed equal protection was not violated by the bill; though unexempted property was discriminated against, the bill advanced a public purpose. Finally, the classification of taxable property was based on a reasonable distinction that promoted the public welfare and did not require any taxpayer to pay more than his fair share, in conformity with N.H. Const. part I, art. 12.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While responding to another call, police arrested defendant on an outstanding warrant.

On appeal, the State argued the trial court erred in ruling, as a matter of law, that defendant's hunting knife was not a dangerous weapon under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:3 (1994). The court found that the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, suggested defendant intended to use his hunting knife to threaten or injure. A reasonable jury could have found that the knife constituted a &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; because of the serious and immediate danger it posed to the police and members of the public. Further, the court found that a fair reading of the statute informed by its purpose placed a defendant on notice that possession of a six-inch hunting knife could constitute a &quot;dangerous weapon,&quot; and thus was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school district challenged a newly enacted statute establishing a uniform education property tax to provide funding for an adequate public education, 1999 N.H. Laws 17. The primary issue presented by plaintiff was whether the phase-in provision of the statute was constitutional. The tax contained a provision, which effected a phase-in of the uniform tax rate in property rich communities, where taxpayers were not in jeopardy of economic hardship from paying the full tax, and imposed payment of the full tax on poorer communities. The court concluded that the disparate tax treatment was so arbitrary as to serve no useful purpose of a public nature, thereby failing to serve the general welfare. The provision was, therefore, unconstitutional as unreasonable and disproportionate. The court also determined that the provision was integral and essential to the statute, and could not be severed. Thus the entire statute could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the phase-in provision of the education property tax statute was unconstitutional, because it was violative of state constitution in that the varying property tax rates were unreasonable and disproportionate, and unseverable, because it was integral and essential to the tax statute.</SPAN></P>

The fact that ordinance amendments to explicitly permit aircraft takeoffs and landings were defeated by voters was not relevant because legislative history will not be consulted when the language of an ordinance is plain.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's dismissal of petitioner's injunctive relief and writ of mandamus, but reversed and remanded the decision of respondent compensation appeals board's reduction of petitioner's benefits. Plaintiff argued that the composition of respondent violated the state constitution in that it required petitioner to appear before an inherently biased board, but the court found that administrative officials who serve in an adjudicatory capacity were presumed to be of conscience and capable of reaching a just and fair result, and petitioner failed in his burden to present sufficient evidence to rebut that presumption. The court also found that the workers' compensation act's compelled adjudication of the underlying facts by an administrative body did not offend the separation of powers doctrine. The court held, however, that in reducing benefits, the burden was on the moving party to establish that a changed condition warranted a reduction, and respondent's determination was reversed and remanded because it was wrongly based on the respondent's finding that petitioner failed to meet petitioner's burden once a changed condition was established.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of New Hampshire appealed from an order of the Superior Court (New Hampshire), which denied its motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff property owners. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 483-C (Supp. 1998), which defined the public's trust rights in coastal shorelands, effected an unconstitutional taking of private property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 483-C (Supp. 1998) was unconstitutional as it authorized a taking of private property from plaintiff property owners without just compensation. Defendant state argued that the legislature had authority to establish a statutory boundary line for public trust rights in coastal shorelands, and that the statute codified New Hampshire common law. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 483-C (Supp. 1998) established that the boundary line was the furthest landward limit reached by the highest tidal flow. The court held that New Hampshire common law established the high water mark at the level of mean high tide. Therefore, the mean high tide was the high water mark or common law coastal boundary between public and private shorelands. As the statute unilaterally authorized the taking of private shoreland for public use and provided no compensation, the statute was unconstitutional. The court remanded for a determination whether any plaintiffs suffered damages and were entitled to just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for a determination of the location of the high mean water mark to determine which plaintiffs, if any, had a claim for damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estate sought an interlocutory appeal without ruling from the Superior Court, Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire) to challenge the constitutionality of N.H. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556:13 (1997), which governed the damages recoverable in its action for wrongful death against defendant, on the ground that the damage cap applicable to decedents without dependent relatives violated N.H. Const. part I, art. 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that the damages cap of N.H. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556:13 (1997) unconstitutionally discriminated between decedents suffering injuries that caused their death and those suffering injuries but who died of other causes, the court struck the statute and remanded. The court held that the purpose of N.H. Const. part I, art. 14, was to make civil remedies readily available and to guard against arbitrary and discriminatory infringements on access to the courts. The court held that &sect; 556:13 warranted middle-tier scrutiny under part I, art. 14. The court held that the &sect; 556:13 discrimination between decedents with and without dependents bore a fair and substantial relationship to the statute's purpose of compensating dependent persons. However, the court held that the &sect; 556:13 discrimination between decedents who died of the injury complained of and those who died of an unrelated cause, bore no such relation. Furthermore, within this classification, the court held that it could not discern any legislative rationale for capping the pre-death losses for decedents who died of their injury but not the pre-death for decedents who did not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted plaintiff's appeal and struck the wrongful death statute's cap on damages recoverable for decedents who died without dependent relatives. Although the explicit classification between decedents with and without dependent relatives was constitutional, the statute's de facto discrimination between decedents who died of the complained-of injury and those who died of other causes was not. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, defendant unsuccessfully sought to dismiss the endangerment indictment, arguing it was unconstitutionally duplicitous because it charged the offense as courses of conduct rather than a single act. On appeal, the court agreed and reversed defendant's conviction under &sect; 639:3, III. The court found that the statute defined each act of soliciting a minor to engage in a single act of sexual penetration as a separate offense of endangering the welfare of the child, and thus concluded that prosecution under &sect; 639:3, III did not permit charging a course of conduct. Rejecting defendant's other points of error, including ineffective assistance of counsel, the court affirmed his two convictions for felonious sexual assault and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

First, the senate asked if N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 28, which provided that no tax should be levied without the consent of the people or their representatives in the legislature, could provide authority for the bill. The court held that pt. I, art. 28 did not reserve a right for the people to consent by binding referendum to the establishment and levy of general taxes because the power of taxation was delegated to the legislature. The legislature could not delegate its power in matters affecting the entire state. The senate also asked the court to determine whether the bill would be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The court answered in the affirmative. The court stated that a legislature acting under delegated authority could not redelegate its powers to another, but could enact laws to take effect on a future event.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment abating a verdict against defendant school district in plaintiff executor's wrongful death action. The court held that defendant was not entitled to an abatement of the verdict because defendant had purchased additional insurance above the statutory limit. The court stated that the purpose of the abatement statute was to permit recovery of damages against governmental units up to the limit of insurance purchased and not to reduce the recovery of damages despite the purchase of additional insurance coverage. The court further held that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of loss of life damages because the wrongful death statute,&nbsp;N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:12, permitted such damages. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting decedent's computer diary and photographs depicting decedent and his belongings because they provided evidence of decedent's lost life and rebutted defendant's contention that decedent had health problems prior to his fatal accident. The court found no other errors and affirmed on all issues except for the abatement issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which abated the verdict against defendant school district. The court concluded that defendant carried additional insurance and that the purpose of the abatement statute was to limit recovery up to the limit of insurance coverage. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the defendant was convicted of perjury and unsworn falsification, in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 641:1, 641:3 (1996), by the Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire), he applied for but was denied court-appointed appellate counsel under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 604-A:2 (1986 &amp; Supp. 1998). Defendant appealed, arguing that his wife's income and assets should not have been included in determining whether he was indigent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Charged with falsifying a prescription, defendant applied for court-appointed counsel and filed a financial affidavit, however he left blank all spaces on the affidavit that asked for his spouse's assets or income. Although initially approved, the court denied defendant's application upon the state's motion to vacate the appointment of counsel because the defendant failed to disclose his wife's financial information. Following his conviction of perjury and unsworn falsification, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 641:1, 641:3 (1996), brought largely because of the alleged false statements made in the financial affidavits. Defendant appealed and again sought but was denied court-appointed counsel. On appeal from that denial, while acknowledging that a court may not reject a defendant's request for counsel merely because a person liable for a defendant's support was unwilling to hire counsel, the appellate court held that a court had the duty under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 604-A:2-a (1986) to review a spouse's income to determine a defendant's eligibility for court-appointed appellate counsel, and the office of cost containment was ordered to make such a determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a group of 29 lessees, appealed the decision of the New Hampshire Board of Tax and Land Appeals (board), which granted only a partial abatement of petitioners' 1993 property taxes. The board held petitioners' leasehold interests were taxable. The board relied on N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72:23 (1991) in finding that the amenity value of petitioners' leaseholds were taxable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a group of 29 lessees, all leased small tracts of land on which they constructed seasonal residential dwellings. Up until 1993, the town taxed petitioners for the assessed value of the building only. In 1993, the town added a site amenity value to the depreciated cost of the buildings on each site. Petitioners unsuccessfully applied to the town for abatement. On appeal, the Board of Tax and Land Appeals held the leasehold interests were taxable, but granted partial abatement. The court vacated the order granting partial abatement and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that each lease was not renewable indefinitely or perpetual and did not contain provisions indicating petitioners agreed to pay property taxes on the underlying value of the leasehold; thus, petitioners' leasehold interests were not taxable. The court held that because petitioners' lease agreements did not contain provisions for the payment of property taxes, petitioners' leaseholds were not taxable under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72:23 (1991). The court held a site amenity charge added to the depreciated cost of petitioners' buildings based on the underlying value of the land was illegal.</SPAN></P>

The court held petitioners' leasehold interests were not taxable where their leases were neither perpetual nor renewable indefinitely, and where petitioners, in their lease agreements, did not agree to pay property taxes.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff school board asked the court to lift the stay entered in the matter; develop a contingent plan to ensure that funding of public schools would continue; order the parties to go to mediation; declare defendant's definition of adequacy unconstitutional; and award plaintiff attorney's fees and costs. The court denied all motions except plaintiff's request for attorney's fees and costs. It denied defendant's motion to extend the validity of the current funding system because the constitutional rights of the people of the state concerning public education could be denied no longer. It stated that the stay would be lifted when the legislative session ended. The court saw no need for a contingent plan because a constitutional funding plan would be in effect at the start of the tax year. It found mediation impractical. Because defendant had not completely defined a constitutionally adequate education, the court declined to determine whether the definition adopted was facially unconstitutional. The court took the motion for attorney's fees under advisement and granted plaintiff costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, court security officers, filed a petition for a writ of prohibition in an original proceeding, which requested the court to prevent respondent, the administrative office of the courts, from enforcing the provisions of 1998 N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The provisions of 1998 N.H. Laws 297 mandated that on the effective date, that county sheriff departments would be responsible for providing security in all state courts except the supreme court, and that all judicial branch employee positions associated with the security function in those courts would be abolished. Petitioners, court security officers, filed a petition for a writ of prohibition in an original proceeding in the court that requested the court to prevent respondent, the administrative office of the courts, from enforcing the provisions of 1998 N.H. Laws 297. The court held that 1998 N.H. Laws 297 violated the Separation of Powers Clause of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. The court also held that portions of 1998 N.H. Laws 297 were invalid insofar as it required that all court security would be provided by county sheriffs and their deputies because that removed control of the essential function of court security from the judiciary and placed the ultimate responsibility with the executive branch. The court ordered respondent to cease implementation of the offending provisions of 1998 N.H. Laws 297.</SPAN></P>

After denying defendant's motion to set aside the verdict and his request for a mistrial, the trial court entered judgment on defendant's convictions for felonious reckless conduct and felonious use of body armor and sentenced defendant to prison. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that imposition of &sect; 651:2(II-g)'s minimum mandatory sentence was proper because defendant was convicted of felonious reckless conduct for which the use of a deadly weapon was an element. Defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy because he received only one punishment upon his conviction for reckless conduct and the consideration of an enhancement factor was not a second punishment. The trial court's refusal to allow defendant to depose witnesses was reasonable because defendant had access to extensive discovery records and suffered no unfair surprise at trial. N.H. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district filed a petition for declarative and injunctive relief challenging the method by which the governor provided funds for education to children in the state and the disproportionality of the taxes levied to pay for education. The trial court entered a judgment that the system of school financing did not violate the state constitution. On appeal, the school district contended that the school tax was a state tax that should be imposed at a uniform rate throughout the state. The court held (1) the varying property tax rates across the state violated N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 83, in that such taxes, which supported the public purpose of education, were unreasonable and disproportionate, (2) a constitutionally adequate public education was a fundamental right in the state of New Hampshire, a right not based on the exclusive needs of a particular individual but rather a right held by the public to enforce the state's duty.</SPAN></P>

The patient brought suit against the doctor in New Hampshire and the lower court held that it had personal jurisdiction over the doctor. The doctor appealed the interlocutory order and the court reversed. The court held that in patient-doctor litigation, the patient had the burden of proving that the doctor purposefully availed himself of the privileges of conducting activities within his patient's state. It was not enough that the some of the doctor's patients were New Hampshire residents, he accepted payments from New Hampshire insurance and Medicare providers, and employed New Hampshire residents. The doctor's hospital's association with the forum state was irrelevant to the determination of personal jurisdiction over the doctor. Challenges to personal jurisdiction had to be made prior to litigating the action on its merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners sued defendant town to set aside a tax collector's deed that transferred to the town land owned by the landowners. The Cheshire Superior Court (New Hampshire) ruled that the tax deed was valid against the first landowner, but invalid with respect to the second landowner, and dismissed the claim that the acquisition by tax deed constituted an impermissible taking under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners owed the town a 1998 timber tax, 1989 property taxes, and 1990 property taxes. The second landowner issued a check for the property taxes, but the tax collector applied the funds to the 1988 timber tax and the 1989 property taxes. In 1993, the tax collector issued a tax deed conveying the land to the town. The state supreme court concluded that the timber tax lien was invalid against the second landowner because notice to the second landowner of the timber tax was statutorily insufficient. Where the names and addresses of both landowners were listed on the property deed, the statutory directive was not fulfilled when the tax collector sent notice only to the first landowner at his home address. Both parties contested the trial court's ruling with respect to the validity of the 1993 tax deed. The state supreme court concluded that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 80 did not direct the tax collector, in a case where there were multiple outstanding liens, to apply funds to the oldest tax liability first. Thus, the second landowner could direct payment of funds as he saw fit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the town failed to give proper statutory notice to the second landowner of the timber tax lien and reversed its ruling that the 1993 tax deed to the town was valid as to the first landowner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dirt bike driver appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire), which, on remand from an appeal after a grant of summary judgment to defendant property owners, held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 215-A:34 (1989) barred all claims asserted by the driver, including those alleging the property owners' willful and malicious conduct, in the driver's personal injury action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment to the property owners in the driver's personal injury action, and the court, on appeal, affirmed in part and remanded for the trial court to further consider the scope of immunity under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 215-A:34 and whether it barred all of the driver's claims. The trial court determined that &sect; 215-A:34 barred, not only the negligence claims, but also the claims alleging willful and malicious conduct. The trial court also concluded that &sect; 215-A:34 was not an unconstitutional deprivation of the driver's right to seek recovery for his injuries. The court affirmed. The court noted that &sect; 215-A:34(II) imposed no duties on landowners and interpreted it to mean that a landowner owed off-highway recreational vehicle (OHRV) operators no duty to protect them from inherent risks. Moreover, the statute was not unconstitutional because it only prevented an OHRV operator from recovering against a landowner for inherent risks of the activity. Limiting liability for owners, occupants, and lessees of land had a fair and substantial relation to a permissible legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Hampshire House of Representatives requested an opinion of the justices as to the constitutionality of a pending bill, HB 198-LOCAL, which permitted towns or cities to vote to adopt construction property tax exemptions for industrial users.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the classification of taxable property provided for in the bill was based on a reasonable distinction which promoted a proper object of public welfare and did not require any taxpayer to pay more than his or her fair share of the tax burden as required by N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12. There were just reasons for providing limited tax exemptions for industrial construction, and the bill promoted the public welfare. The temporary exemption of certain real property from property taxes did not violate the constitutional requirements of uniformity and equality governing the assessment of property taxes as required by N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5 because communities were not required to adopt the optional exemptions provided by the bill, and any property tax imposed would be uniform and equal within each taxing district. The court held that the bill provided for a tax exemption, not the expenditure of public funds for private purposes. The object of the bill was not to aid or benefit private persons for private ends, but to benefit the public at large by increasing the resources of the state and its taxable property through the establishment of new industries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that, while it could not predict every issue that might be raised in an adversary setting should the bill become law, the proposed legislation appeared to be constitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary, a class B felony, and theft by unauthorized taking, a class A felony. He was under 21 years of age at the time of the offenses. His sentences were completed on July 27, 1994. Defendant filed petitions for the annulment of his convictions and sentences on March 31, 1995. The state filed a motion, which sought the dismissal of the petitions as premature under the current version of the annulment statute,&nbsp;N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 651:5 (1996). The matter was transferred to the court without a ruling by the trial court. With regard to felonies, the court found that the current version was applicable to petitions that were filed after January 1, 1995. Therefore, the current statute,&nbsp;N.H. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant fraternity was convicted and sentenced in the Strafford County Superior Court (New Hampshire) on charges of selling alcohol in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 179:5 (1994) and prostitution in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 645:2, I(e) (1996), the fraternity appealed both the conviction and sentence, and challenged certain evidentiary rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A fraternity was convicted of violating laws forbidding alcohol sales to minors and prostitution, after a party at which underage guests bought beer from a fraternity-controlled machine and paid for oral sex with dancers. The court rejected challenges to the convictions and sentence, holding that fraternity members who sold beer were acting on the fraternity's behalf, the fraternity had acted recklessly, and it was liable for the members' criminal acts. The court also rejected challenges to the prostitution conviction. However, it vacated parts of the sentence, finding that to the extent the sentence of probation allowed unannounced police officer searches or allowed unreasonable probation officer searches, it was invalid. While the condition allowing random warrantless searches by probation officers without requiring particularized suspicion of misconduct was constitutionally permissible because it furthered the fraternity's rehabilitation or supervision, to the extent city police officers were allowed to undertake such searches, the probation condition was unconstitutional. Noting that probation searches, even if warrantless, had to be reasonable, the court vacated and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 40-year old male, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Belknap (New Hampshire), which convicted him of being an accomplice to the sale of a controlled drug in violation of N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:2 (1995). Defendant sought review of the trial court's denial of a Batson-based challenge that he made after jury selection based on the prosecution's two peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant participated in the sale of marijuana to a police officer. The prosecution exercised two of its three peremptory challenges to remove from the jury a 19 year-old man and a 25 year-old man. The defense exercised all three of its peremptory challenges to remove three men (ages 47, 65, and 68). The empaneled jury contained three men (ages 34, 37, and 57); the remaining jurors were women, two of whom were 27and 28 years old, respectively. At the conclusion of jury selection, defendant raised a Batson-based challenge to the prosecution's two peremptory challenges. In Batson, the Supreme Court had held that the prosecution had violated the Constitution when it exercised peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors on account of race. Defendant claimed that the prosecution had discriminated on the basis of age and gender. The court affirmed. The court held that: (1) age did not constitute a cognizable class under Batson; (2) defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of a purposeful or intentional discrimination on the part of the state in exercising its peremptory challenges; and (3) the jury selection process was &quot;fair and nondiscriminatory.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that by conceding that former chapter 77 violated the commerce clause by discriminating between interest and dividends earned from in-state banks and interest and dividends earned from out-of-state banks, the state had to also concede that the commerce clause was violated by favoring New Hampshire bank interest and dividends over other types of investment income, such as out-of-state corporate stock dividends and bond interest. The state argued that the commerce clause was not violated as to interest and dividends earned on out-of-state corporate sources because that income was taxed equally regardless of where the corporation was located. The court held that banks were a distinctive class and that recognition of the inherent differences between banks and other business and financial organizations justified differing tax treatments. Therefore, the court held that the legislature's decision to exempt bank interest and stock bank dividends from taxation under chapter 77 was a valid classification under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of six separate acts of aggravated felonious sexual assault and felonious sexual assault. Defendant appealed, and argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to depose the victim, his motion for a bill of particulars, and his motion for mistrial. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that passing references to the denial of due process, without more, did not constitute a valid appellate argument. Defendant failed to show why taking the victim's deposition was necessary for him to receive a fair trial. When defendant denied ever having intercourse with the victim, it was not error to permit the State to decide during trial which acts of intercourse it intended to use to support the charges because there was no prejudice to defendant. The prosecution's failure to disclose that the victim would testify as to statements made by defendant after the assaults had ceased did not prejudice defendant because he was given overnight to prepare his cross-examination and did not request a continuance.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for the horse association on both counts, and the breeder appealed. On review, the court found that judgment pursuant to the Act was inapplicable because the horse association was not a consumer. The breeder's fraudulent dealings with the horse association were insufficient to implicate the Act. The court found that fraud had been proven by clear and convincing evidence, as the breeder's mare could not have produced five foals during the short period in which the breeder had owned the mare.

The driver of the other vehicle suffered severe injuries. The state charged defendant with operation of a motor vehicle after having been certified as a habitual offender, aggravated driving while intoxicated, and second-degree assault. Defendant brought a motion to quash the aggravated driving and second-degree assault indictments on double jeopardy grounds. Following the superior court's denial of the motion to quash, defendant was found guilty of all counts. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court rejected defendant's argument that the aggravated driving charge and the second-degree assault charge constituted the same offense because although both offenses shared the common element of serious bodily injury, each required proof that the other did not and, thus, were not the same offenses for state constitutional protection against double jeopardy.

This alleged constitutional violation failed to rise to the level of a jurisdictional defect resulting from the failure to appoint counsel at all.

Four years later defendant was convicted of stalking. Defendant was not provided with counsel at the stalking trial because it was a class B misdemeanor. Shortly thereafter, the state filed a motion to revoke the suspended witness tampering sentence based on defendant's misdemeanor stalking conviction. The trial court revoked the suspended sentence. On review, defendant argued that an uncounseled conviction could not be used as a basis to revoke a suspended sentence. However, the court found that defendant had no right to counsel in the stalking case because there was no possibility of incarceration. Furthermore, defendant was not imprisoned for the stalking, but rather for her conduct that violated the conditions of her suspended sentence. Finally, revocation of the suspended sentence was valid because the state proved a violation of the condition upon which the sentence was suspended. Therefore, the trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The criminal court dismissed the action on the merits. The arrestee then filed a civil action against the town and its police department under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the superior court entered judgment for the town and dismissed the action. On appeal, the arrestee argued that the police had arrested him without probable cause. He also argued that the dismissal of charges collaterally estopped the police from challenging the validity of his arrest. The court explained that the information needed to support probable cause for an arrest was less than what was required to convict. Thus, the issues were not identical and collateral estoppel did not apply. The police acted as persons of reasonable caution and prudence when making the arrest. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that at the time of the arrest, the police had probable cause to believe that the arrestee had committed a crime. The decision of the criminal court not to convict the arrestee did not collaterally estop the police from arguing that there was probable cause for the arrest. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 420-B:26 in refusing to provide him with certain records. The court stated that although the relationship in the case was similar to an employment relationship, the trial court erred in applying employment legal standards to the case. The court rejected the HMO's contention that the physician's petition only alleged an employment argument. The court also stated that the physician was entitled to proceed upon the merits of his claim that the HMO's decision to terminate its relationship with him was made in bad faith or violated public policy. The court held that the trial court properly found no state action and properly dismissed the due process claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the school district argued that: a 1985 amendment to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 193:27(I), that added &quot;residential school&quot; to the definition of &quot;home for children,&quot; created an unfunded mandate in violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 28-a; and N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 186-C:2(I) (Supp. 1994) and N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 186-C:19-a(II) did not require school districts to perform evaluations, develop individualized education plans, and hold staffings for incarcerated special education students between the ages of 18 and 21. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The amendment did not create an unconstitutional, unfunded mandate because it did not represent a new, expanded, or modified program or responsibility to the school district in such a way as to necessitate additional local expenditures. The court was mindful of the burden that the statutes placed upon the school district by requiring their personnel to develop individualized education plans for educationally disabled incarcerated students between the ages of 18 and 21. Whether to transfer that burden elsewhere, however, was a question for the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners filed suit against the town after the proposed sale of their junkyard fell through. The owners alleged that the town's attempt to require a license for the transfer of the junkyard was preempted by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 236:90-:110 (1993). The owners further alleged that the town's licensing restrictions constituted an unconstitutional taking. The trial court ruled that &sect; 236:90-:110 preempted the town's ability to regulate the junkyard and submitted the case to a jury, which awarded damages to the owners. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 236:90-:110 did not purport to comprehensively regulate junkyards and that local zoning ordinances could apply where the statute did not. Accordingly, the court held that the trial court erred by ruling that the town's licensing requirements were per se arbitrary and unreasonable on the ground that the town lacked authority to license the junkyard. Therefore, the trial court further erred by instructing the jury that it did not have to consider the reasonableness of the town's actions.</SPAN></P>

When the trial court ruled that the doctrine of sovereign immunity would not insulate the city and the DOT from the lawsuit, interlocutory review was sought, and the court reversed. The court held the DOT was entitled to immunity because the DOT's decision regarding the beacon had been discretionary, rather than ministerial, under the Traffic Control Standards, Statutes &amp; Policies. Likewise, the court held the city was entitled to immunity because the city's decisions regarding traffic control rested on an exercise of discretion. Finally, the court refused to hold that the DOT's and the city's actual knowledge of the intersection's accident history had removed the decision-making process from immune status.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff, therefore, withdrew his breach of contract or warranty actions and excepted to the trial court's ruling regarding the damages available for those claims. Plaintiff testified that the doctor made statements about playing basketball again. Plaintiff contended the trial court had unconstitutionally deprived him of these causes of action, but the court held that it need not reach that question because the doctor's statements did not amount to a warranty. Plaintiff also contended a res ipsa loquitur instruction should have been given, but the court disagreed because a nurse had given the doctor an incorrect sponge count, upon which the doctor was entitled to rely.

The court affirmed the ruling in favor of the town and held that the buffer zone requirement to was a valid and reasonable regulation that was consistent with the due process requirements of the state constitution. Reasonable zoning regulations that limited economic uses of property, but did not substantially destroy the value of an individual piece of property, were constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire certified state law questions in a suit by plaintiff female students against defendants, school district, officials, teachers, coaches, and employees, arising out of allegations of exploitation, harassment, assault, and sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-C:29 (1990), which required the reporting of child abuse, did not create a private right of action in favor of an abused child against those who violated the statute. Further, a violation of the reporting statute did not constitute negligence per se in an action based on inadequate supervision of a student. The court held that those in a supervisory position over students had a duty to reasonably supervise their students. There was also a duty not to hire or retain employees that the school district or officials knew or have should known had a propensity for sexually abusing students. In a negligent hiring or retention action, failure to report abuse in accordance with the statute could give rise to liability, provided the plaintiff showed that reporting would have prevented the subsequent abuse. Liability might exist for abuse after school hours or after graduation where, but for the hiring and retention of the abusing employee, there would have been no relationship between abuser and victim. The court declined to recognize any new constitutional torts because the female students had an adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions and remanded the case to the federal district court.</SPAN></P>

In an interlocutory transfer, defendant argued that the lower court order that required the disclosure of information regarding certain witnesses violated the work product doctrine and his rights to effective assistance of counsel and against self-incrimination. The court affirmed the lower court order and remanded the case. The court held that the exchange of witness lists was required for the fair and efficient conduct of trials and that they were an exception to the work product doctrine. The court held that the production of expert reports from those experts defendant intended to call at trial did not violate the work product doctrine. N.H. Super. Ct. R. 99 authorized the lower court to require parties to exchange statements of witnesses, reports, results, or conclusions thereto. The lower court properly limited the scope of its order to those witnesses the defendant intended to call at trial, therefore the court held that the order did not violate defendant's rights against self-incrimination and the right to the effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners had considerable acreage that they managed for forestry purposes within the town. The town enacted a zoning ordinance that established a minimum lot size within the town's mountain and forest districts. The owners challenged the ordinance, but ultimately it was upheld by the superior court. The court affirmed the superior court's decision and held that the property owners lacked standing to bring an exclusionary zoning claim. The owners did not have a sufficient interest in contesting the effect of the ordinance on the availability of low- or moderate-income housing on their own land so as to be aggrieved by the exclusionary effect of the ordinance. The court held that the town's zoning ordinance was properly enacted by a simple majority vote because the preexisting land use regulations were not so comprehensive as to acquire the status of de facto zoning. The provisions of the ordinance did not violate the owners' substantive due process rights because the minimum lot size was rationally related to the town's legitimate goals of encouraging forestry and timber harvesting. The ordinance was not a growth control ordinance pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 674:22.</SPAN></P>

The necessary specificity, however, did not need to be contained in the statute itself, but rather, the statute in question could be read in the context of related statutes, prior decisions, or generally accepted usage.

The employee then filed a claim for permanent partial impairment benefits. The Department denied his claim, finding that N.H. Rev. Stat.

The court affirmed the Department's findings as supported by competent evidence in the record.

The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that in order to establish a reasonable probability that the DCYS records contained relevant information, defendant had to present some specific concern that would probably be explained by information in the DCYS file. The court determined that even if the evidence of the prior assaults was not properly admitted under N.H. R. Evid. 404(a), defendant had created a misleading advantage by lying under oath and was deemed to have &quot;opened the door,&quot; under N.H. R. Evid. 608(b), to the use of otherwise inadmissible evidence to show that he lied and to refute the impressions created by his testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senate had passed the act identified as S.B. 636 (N.H. 1994), which recognized and confirmed a public easement in the coastal beaches where the public had traditionally had access, which was an amendment to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 483-B, &sect; 9-a (1992). The representatives requested the court's opinion. The court opined that, although an opinion of the court was not binding in the event that the proposed legislation became law, the result of the legislation, which created a public easement in beach property, was an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation and held that under the N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12 and U.S. Const. amend. V, the government could not take the private property along the beach frontage without just compensation. Further, the provisions of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 483-B, &sect; 9-a declared that there was an easement for the public use of the beach property, which amounted to the taking of the property for public use without compensation being paid to the owners of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that in its opinion the proposed legislation, if passed, amounted to the taking of private property for use by the public without providing to the private owners of the beach property just compensation, which was a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-conspirator were arrested when cocaine was found in cottages rented by defendant. The trial court admitted the non-testifying co-conspirator's guilty plea, acknowledgement of rights form, and conspiracy indictment as substantive evidence against defendant. The court found that these admissions were error because the potential for prejudice against defendant was overwhelming when a non-testifying co-conspirator's conviction was admitted for substantive purposes, particularly when all the State's witnesses had significant credibility problems. The court said that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:26, VI (Supp. 1993), requiring that defendant reach a pre- or post-trial agreement with the State to avoid a mandatory minimum sentence, under N.H. Const. part 1, art. 15, did not unnecessarily chill defendant's right to a jury trial because the statute permitted plea agreements before and after trial, so a defendant who asserted his right to a jury trial was not precluded from receiving a lesser sentence after the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in a work-related car accident. The employee collected worker's compensation benefits under a policy issued by the insurer to the employee's business. The employee settled a claim with the tortfeasor and obtained payment of a claim for uninsured motorist benefits under an automobile insurance policy under which both he and his business were named insureds. The insurer was granted summary judgment on the issue of whether it was entitled to a lien against the uninsured motorist benefits recovery. On appeal, the court affirmed that judgment. The court ruled that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 281-A:13, I (a)(2) and (b) (Supp. 1993) governed the issue of the insured's right to a lien, regardless of the employee's claim that the workers' compensation insurance agreement did not provide for such a lien. The court then ruled that under the clear language of the statute, the insurer was properly granted a lien. Such a lien, the court ruled, prevented employees from being rewarded for the &quot;fortuity&quot; of experiencing a collision with an uninsured tortfeasor. The court rejected the employee's claims that &sect; 281-A:13, I violated equal protection and due process principles.</SPAN></P>

Prior to defendant's conviction, the legislature amended the limitations period to 22 years from the victim's eighteenth birthday.  N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 625:8, III. Defendant appealed. The court held that because the original limitations period did not run, subsequent modifications were merely regulatory and applied retroactively. The court held that the evidence supported the jury's conclusion that the offense occurred within the statute of limitations and the victim's thirteenth birthday. The court held that the victim's prior consistent statements were properly admitted pursuant to N.H. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) where the defense challenged the victim's credibility on cross-examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town assessed a taxpayer's land for property taxes, and the bank held a mortgage to the assessed land. The taxpayer failed to pay the assessment, and the town tax collector executed liens on the property, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 80:20-a (1991), notifying the bank of such liens at that time. The town tax collector later issued deeds for the property and refused the bank's offer to pay the arrearages. The bank sought to enforce its mortgage, but the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the town. The bank appealed, seeking the property's escrowed funds, and the court reversed, holding that the bank did not receive notice of the extermination of its rights in the property prior to the issuance of deeds. The court found that although the town's tax liens had priority over the bank's mortgage, by the lack of notice, the tax lien deeds did not extinguish all of the bank's interest in the property. The court concluded that fundamental fairness required notice to mortgagees of: the issue date of tax lien deeds; the expiration date of the right of redemption; and a warning that the mortgage would be eradicated by tax lien deed if the property was not redeemed.</SPAN></P>

The delegation of authority to the board of education for creation of the school district complied with constitutional requirements. The trial court had found that RSA &sect; 195:2 (New Hampshire) set forth &quot;a declared policy and a prescribed standard&quot; and, therefore, that the statute did not rise to the level of an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The court agreed on appeal with the trial court's assessment. The court found that RSA &sect; 195:18 was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The schools filed a petition for declaratory judgment alleging, in six counts, that the system by which the state financed public education violated the New Hampshire constitution.

II, art. 83 (art. 83) imposed a duty on the state to provide a constitutionally adequate education to every educable child in the public schools in New Hampshire and to guarantee adequate funding. The court ruled that art. 83, the Encouragement of Literature Clause, which stated that it was the duty of the legislators and magistrates to cherish, among other things, the public schools, was not merely a statement of aspiration, but a clear and certain mandate that the state provide an education to its citizens.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a police officer who had observed him loitering in an area where the officer knew burglaries had recently occurred. The officer obtained a warrant to search defendant's car and found the instrumentalities of a burglary. The trial court dismissed the loitering and prowling charge, and found that the stop and arrest were invalid. The superior court relitigated the stop and arrest and denied defendant's motion to dismiss and suppress evidence. The superior court convicted defendant of burglary, under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 635:1 (1986). On appeal the court affirmed. The court found that the officer had a sufficient basis to make an investigatory stop because he knew that burglaries had occurred in the area, knew that the vehicle did not belong to an owner of any of the businesses in the area, and knew that the vehicle was in an area hours before the businesses were open. Defendant failed to show that the superior court abused its discretion when it asked only one of defendant's requested voir dire questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured persons filed suit against the city to recover for personal injuries they sustained when they drove off the end of a road located within the city. Their complaint alleged that the city was negligent under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 231:2, 231:92 (1982). The trial court denied the city's motion to dismiss, and the city appealed. The court affirmed the order. The trial court correctly found that &sect; 231:92, as it existed at the time of the accident, provided the injured persons with a private cause of action under the facts alleged. Even if actual notice was required, it was alleged that the city had actual notice of the lack of proper signage and railings that caused the injuries. The injured persons could not have maintained a private cause of action under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 231.2 (1982) because allegations thereunder merely demonstrated that the city had legal control over the highway. However, as the public duty rule did not bar an action under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 231:92 (1982), there was no error in denying the motion to dismiss based thereon. The injured persons were not barred on the ground of discretionary immunity from bringing this suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus, following a decision of a superior court (New Hampshire), which denied his motion for bail pending sentencing and appeal. Petitioner alleged that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 597:1-a, I (Supp. 1992) was unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of felonious sexual assault, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 632-A:3 (1986). The trial court ordered petitioner incarcerated pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 597:1-a, I (Supp. 1992). Petitioner argued that the legislature's inclusion of felonious sexual assault among nonbailable offenses in &sect; 597:1-a, I, while excluding other class B felonies, was a violation of equal protection under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 2 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court agreed with petitioner that convicted class B felons were similarly situated and that &sect; 597:1-a, I treated differently those within that group who were convicted of felonious sexual assault. The right at issue was not the broad right to liberty; petitioner lost that right upon conviction of a felony. Accordingly, the court applied the rational basis test. The court concluded that the legislature could rationally have determined that individuals convicted of felonious sexual assault constituted a special danger to the community as distinguished from other class B felons. Thus, denying bail was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Additionally, the court rejected petitioner's ex post facto argument.</SPAN></P>

The district court certified questions of law to the court, including whether the substantive law of New Hampshire or of Kansas governed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured as a result of lead dust exposure while working for the employer in Kansas. The employee and his wife later moved to New Hampshire where the illness was discovered. They instituted an action in New Hampshire and argued that the law of that state applied. On the district court's certification of questions, the court remanded and held that Kansas law applied. The court held that, given that the issue involved in the action was whether the employee suffered from an occupational disease acquired during his employment with the employer, that Kansas had a justified expectation that disputes between a Kansas employer and employee regarding workplace injuries which occurred within that state would be governed by its workers' compensation scheme, and that virtually all of the essential elements connected with the lawsuit were grouped within Kansas, analysis of the choice-influencing considerations revealed that Kansas law was to be applied. While the husband and wife advanced compelling equitable arguments, the contacts with New Hampshire were insufficient to warrant application of the forum's law.</SPAN></P>

The lower court dismissed their petition ruling that they failed to state facts from which the lower court could have found a justiciable controversy ripe for declaratory judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed in part. The court determined that the property owners failed to present facts which demonstrated a legal or equitable right to which the town was asserting an adverse claim and that the facts of the case made declaratory judgment inappropriate as to their claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to them. The court found that the property owners made no formal application for the approval of a mobile home park and merely speculated as to what the town would have done had they filed the same or if they would have applied for a variance. The court also found that assuming the property owners were facially attacking the ordinance, the case had to have been remanded to have permitted them to file a declaratory judgment petition setting forth such challenge.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the arguments and affirmed the conviction. The evidence supported the jury's finding that the defendant, in firing seven or eight rounds at the complainant's car, purposely caused pecuniary loss. The amount of this loss simply established the grade of the defendant's offense under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 634:2, II(a) (Supp. 1992). The State did not have to prove that the defendant intended to cause the amount of pecuniary loss needed to enhance the crime to a class B felony.

There was no prejudice to defendant, estimates had provided the basis for past felony convictions under &sect; 634:2, II(a), and a witness qualified as an expert could provide opinion testimony as to scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge that would assist the trier of fact under N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court had determined that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 500-A:13 did not allow a trial court to retain or recall alternate jurors and reconstitute the jury during the course of deliberations, the state senate passed a bill providing for the substitution of alternate jurors after final submission of the case to the jury. The senate requested an opinion from the court as to whether the procedure set out in the bill was constitutional. The court found that the procedure was permitted by the provisions of the constitution that guaranteed the right of trial by jury in civil and criminal cases, provided that certain procedural safeguards were met. The trial court must make a finding on the record that the alternate juror had not been tainted subsequent to the original panel retiring to deliberate and the remaining jurors must affirmatively state that they would start the deliberations from the beginning. Because the discharge of the juror must be for a meritorious reason, the trial court was required to make findings on the record that established a meritorious reason for the discharge as well as eliminated improper reasons.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded compensation for the town's temporary taking of the right of way.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that developer could pass through the town's existing points of access to the state highway by a deviation because there was no showing that developer's deviation would unduly burden the town. The court found the trial court's finding was supported by competent evidence as developer, as owner of the dominant estate, could deviate from the deeded easement to the extent reasonably necessary to secure an egress to the highway. However, the court vacated the award of compensation because no taking occurred. The developer argued that the town planning board's improper denial of his site plan deprived him of a right of way to certain routes. The board denied the developer's site plan application because the board misconstrued the legal effect of the town meeting vote, in light of a town zoning ordinance. The court found that although the board's mistaken decision impeded the developer's conversion of his property into uses that would generate higher rents, the loss was not compensable as a taking. Thus, the court reversed the trial court's award for lost rents. The court found that the trial court properly denied developer's request for fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motor vehicle collided with another automobile and the driver of the second automobile died.

The trial court dismissed the indictment for negligent homicide relating to the accident. The State appealed and the court reversed. The court held as follows: (1) the state legislature's intent to designate certain traffic violations, such as not stopping for a red light, as civil offenses was demonstrated by the statutory mechanisms created for their enforcement and adjudication; (2) double jeopardy did not attach because the offense of not stopping for a red light was civil and not criminal in nature; (3) the enforcement and adjudication of this violation was not so punitive as to negate the legislature's intention; and (4) the penalties imposed for these traffic violations were not criminal sanctions or punishment, but were essentially remedial in nature, designed to compensate the government for its enforcement and administration of the State's motor vehicle laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for witness tampering arose out of his relationship with a 17-year-old witness, who was identified in underlying indictments charging defendant with obscenity, prostitution, and conspiracy to acquire cocaine.

Plaintiffs in the first suit claimed that a bill did not comply with N.H. Const. Pt. II, art. 44, and in the second, claimed that it violated N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 18-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that the bill lacked the necessary two-thirds vote, and that it was a budgetary bill that established, amended, or repealed non-budgetary statutes. The bill was a large, omnibus appropriations bill that originated in the house, but 40 of its 65 sections had no fiscal impact. The senate passed a substantially amended version, and after a committee review with public sessions, the house and senate both agreed on proposed amendments. When the governor vetoed the bill, 247 of 395 house members voted for overriding the veto, 100 voted against, and 52 were not present and voting. The override was also approved in the senate. In the first case, the court examined early constitutional interpretation and other states' constitutions, and it concluded that the necessary two-thirds required two-thirds of those present and voting, a quorum being present. In the second, the court found that the bill was not a &quot;budget bill&quot; in the basic sense of those words, largely because its passage was not subjected to the overwhelming time pressures associated with the biennial budgets, which was what art. 18-a sought to address.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court opined that the bill, which passed with the necessary two-thirds, was not a budget bill and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient was admitted to the hospital where the nurse worked. The patient became agitated and delusional, and the nurse injured her knee while attempting to restrain him. She brought an action against her co-employees sounding in negligence and in &quot;willful, wanton, and reckless&quot; conduct. Her husband joined a loss of consortium claim. The co-employees moved for dismissal, which was granted on the husband's action and the negligence action, but the &quot;willful, wanton, and reckless&quot; conduct claim remained. The co-employees appealed, arguing the action was for a non-intentional tort and was, thereby, precluded by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281-A:8, I(b) (Supp. 1991) of the Workers' Compensation laws. The court held that (1) the statute was constitutional, thus overruling Estabrook v. Am. Hoist &amp; Derrick, Inc., 498 A.2d 741 (N.H. 1985), which allowed non-intentional torts against co-employees; and (2) there was no allegation the co-employees had a substantial certainty that injury would result from their alleged conduct, thus the action was for negligence and not an intentional tort. Therefore, the action was precluded by the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of the motion to dismiss the &quot;willful, wanton, and reckless&quot; conduct charge because non-intentional torts against co-employees were precluded by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marina was a pre-existing, nonconforming use in a lake district that had been established near the mouth of a river. Permitted uses in that district included small hotels and motels, restaurants, small office buildings, and small multiple-family dwellings. The land trust owned property that abutted the marina. The marina applied for a variance to build an additional boat storage building. The zoning board granted the variance. The land trust and its trustees sought judicial review. The trial court upheld the zoning board's decision. On appeal, the court reversed that decision. In order to obtain a variance under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 674:33(I)(b), a party had to establish an unnecessary hardship, which required proof that application of the zoning ordinance would prevent any reasonable use of the land. In that regard, the marina's existence on the site precluded a finding of hardship. Moreover, the expansion of a nonconforming use had to be evaluated in the context of the zone in which it was located. Because the proposed building would impair the lake district's scenic beauty and recreational opportunities, it was beyond the natural expansion of a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

The worker was injured at the borrowing employer's work site. The worker was paid workers' compensation benefits by his employer. The trial court concluded that the worker was a borrowed servant at the time of his injury and that the worker's suit for negligence against the borrowing employer was barred by the immunity granted in R.I. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281-A:8, I. The court affirmed the summary judgment for the borrowing employer. The borrowed servant rule applied to the facts because the rule applied to the master and servant relation under workers' compensation laws. The worker could be consider an employee of the borrowing employer because the worker consented to the borrowing employer's control. The workers' compensation statute was long considered constitutional and the borrowed servant rule was known at the time the legislature adopted the statute. The borrowing employer complied with the workers' compensation statute. The borrowing employer's contract with the worker's employer provided that the employer would maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover the worker. The worker in fact received such benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Hampshire House of Representatives passed a resolution requesting that the court give its opinion on certain questions of law regarding the constitutionality of a pending bill relative to a furlough program for state employees, which would have required all state employees whose salary was greater than $ 15,000 to take unpaid days of leave, thus relieving some of the pressure on the state budget.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill at issue was a budget-slashing device that would have required certain state employees to take unpaid leave. The court found that the bill was unconstitutional because it violated the Contract Clauses in both U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and N.H. Const. pt. 1, art. 23 by substantially impairing the terms of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) then in effect. The CBA plainly guaranteed a work week of a certain length, with allowances made only for holidays and paid leave for the term of the contract. Forcing workers to take unpaid leave thus violated the contract. Its impact was substantial because it would likely have wrought havoc on the finances of many of the affected workers. In addition, as the power to furlough state officials was the power to remove them from their positions piecemeal, the court found that the bill violated N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:1 and thus substantially impaired the officials' vested rights that were equivalent to contractual obligations owed by the state. Consequently, the bill impaired the officials' contractual rights, just as it impaired the CBA, which in turn violated the Contract Clauses of both the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court responded to the House of Representatives that the pending bill did indeed violate the Contract Clauses of both the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, business owner and sign erector, appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Carroll County (New Hampshire), which upheld a decision by the Conway Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) in favor of defendant town to deny the owners' application to use the readerboard portion of their sign.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to erect a readerboard sign for use at the owner's restaurant in order to change the sign to reflect menu changes and features. The town denied plaintiffs' request because the applicable zoning ordinance limited the use of readerboard signs to businesses featuring live entertainment and movies. Both the ZBA and the trial court affirmed the town's decision. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the zoning ordinance violated plaintiffs' equal protection rights as guaranteed by N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 2, 12. The distinction between businesses featuring nightly entertainment and restaurants clearly was not substantially related to the town's goals of preserving aesthetics and ensuring traffic safety. Restaurant readerboards did not impair the town's aesthetics any more or less than readerboards utilized by theaters or businesses featuring live entertainment. Likewise, readerboards advertising meals had the same impact upon traffic safety as did readerboards advertising live entertainment or movies. Further, businesses featuring live entertainment and movies did not have unique advertising needs to those of restaurants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after a confidential informant bought drugs at his residence. At trial, the State introduced, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:26-a (Supp. 1991), a certificate of chemical analysis to prove the composition, quality, and quantity of the substance obtained by the informant. Defendant unsuccessfully objected to the introduction of the certificate; the trial court found that defendant had not shown specific grounds that the composition, quality or quantity of the substance would be contested at trial as required by &sect; 318-B:26-a(II). Defendant appealed and asserted that the use of the certificate evidence to prove an element of the crime deprived him of his right to confront the laboratory employee who had conducted the analysis and precluded him from attacking the chain of custody. In reversing the conviction, the court held that &sect; 318-B:26-a went too far because it required defendant not only to request the presence of the technician but also to explain why he required it. Defendant's constitutional right of confrontation was violated by the statute, which allowed trial by certificate. The court did not address the suppression issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order of a Merrimack County trial court (New Hampshire), which granted the motion of defendant, state department of revenue administration (department), to dismiss the first bill alleging that the interest and dividends assessed for 1985-87 violated the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the second bill alleging the same claims with respect to the 1988 taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On November 28, 1988, a taxpayer received a department notice, dated November 10, 1988, of a tax assessment for 1985-87. On January 25, 1989, the taxpayer filed a bill in equity appealing the assessment on the ground that the interest and dividends tax violated the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses and &sect; 1983. The trial court granted the department's motion to dismiss the first bill and a second bill alleging the same claims with respect to 1988 taxes. The taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed the dismissal of the first bill because the taxpayer introduced no evidence excusing his failure to file his action within 60 days, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77:25, after the date on the notice. The court reversed and remanded the dismissal of the timely second bill alleging constitutional violations, which was not barred by res judicata because it arose from a different factual transaction and accrued after the first bill had been filed. The court affirmed the dismissal of the second claim for prospective relief under &sect; 1983, which the taxpayer had no standing to assert because he was no longer a resident impaired by the tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's first bill alleging that the tax assessed by the department violated the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses and the first and second bill alleging a civil rights violation.

Defendant failed to produce identification, became verbally abusive of the officer, and was arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. During the arrest defendant's arm was broken. While defendant was being transported to the hospital by ambulance, the officer found the marijuana in defendant's purse. The court held that there was no evidence that any member of the public was disturbed by these events and hence that the conviction for disorderly conduct was improper. Reviewing the legislative history of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 622:2, the court held that there was no public inconvenience as required under where there was no evidence that anyone besides the arresting officer was disturbed. As to the marijuana possession charge, at the time the officer explored its contents, the defendant was not at hand. Because whatever was in her purse could not at that time have posed a threat to the welfare of the officer, aided her in effecting an escape, or been destroyed by her, the common-sense factors underlying the rationale for the search incident to arrest exception were not present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with sexual assault, filed a motion to quash the indictment, arguing that the indictment was deficient because it alleged a course of conduct over an undifferentiated six month period.

The court stated that the indictment was unconstitutionally duplicitous because by alleging a course of conduct involving several incidents of intentional touching over a six-month period, it charged more than one offense in one count. The court stated that defendant was entitled to have a jury of his peers determine his guilt or innocence based on a specific incident, rather than a series of incidents. The court found that evidence of more than one incident was admitted at trial without any indication as to which incident the jury was to focus upon in determining guilt, and noted that it was possible that not all of the jurors had considered the same acts when they voted unanimously to convict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town was operating its sewer system illegally by dumping raw sewage in to a river and the town's governing body voted to discontinue use of the sewer system and to spend funds from the town's capital reverse fund to construct individual subsurface disposal systems for town owned buildings. The property owners filed an action seeking to establish that the defendants' action was an inverse condemnation and they were entitled to just compensation and to prevent the defendants from spending money from the capital reserve fund, from abandoning the sewer system, and to compel the town to construct a wastewater treatment facility. The trial court held that defendants had the authority to discontinue the sewer system, but that the discontinuance was an inverse condemnation, and denied defendants' request for attorney fees. On appeal, the court affirmed that the town had the authority to discontinue the sewer system and denial of the defendants' request for attorney's fees. However, the court reversed the finding that the discontinuance constituted an inverse condemnation because the property owners had no vested rights in the sewer system.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed those decisions. The court held that the PUC's modification of its order was proper. The OCA did not meet its burden under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 541:13 of demonstrating by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the PUC's modification order was unjust or unreasonable. By modifying its prior order, the PUC did not relieve the water company of its obligation to file a depreciation study, but merely extended the period of time in which it was to do so. The PUC's action in no way lessened the water company's burden of proving that it was entitled to the requested temporary rates. The PUC was not prohibited from taking administrative notice of the water company's annual reports. Because there was no evidence of actual bias on the part of the PUC, the PUC staff's participation in both investigative and decisional aspects of the temporary rate proceedings did not deny consumers due process. The PUC's temporary rate order was supported by the evidence. The PUC's reliance on the water company's 1989 annual report was proper.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court also declined to declare binding arbitration void as an unlawful delegation of power to a non-public authority. The court affirmed and held that the city charter amendment was valid, but only applied to future contracts because binding arbitration was lawful when proper safeguards were provided, and the arbitrator did not seek to bind the city on cost items. The court held that the amendment was not preempted by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 273-A:12, which sanctioned such arbitration, because there was not sufficient evidence that the legislature intended to make a comprehensive state mandate. The court also denied the teachers' association's cross appeal and held that another amendment giving the city council final approval for any contract did not conflict with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 273-A:3, II(b) because some review could be properly considered a cost item.

Petitioner was committed to a psychiatric facility for a period of five years under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 651:11-a, I, after a renewal hearing regarding his commitment. Petitioner was originally committed after pleading not guilty by reason of insanity to a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was indicted for a crime. He pled not guilty by reason of insanity and was recommitted twice. During the second renewal proceedings, petitioner stipulated that he would accept a commitment of five years, although he could petition for parole. Prior to petitioner's original commitment, the statute had provided that committal orders were only valid for two years. Petitioner applied for a writ of habeas corpus but the trial court denied it. Affirming, the court held that the date of the insanity plea, not the date of the underlying criminal conduct, governed the determination of whether the application of the five year version of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. 651:11-a, I, was retrospective. The court noted that statutes could not be applied retrospectively under the N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23. The court found that the statute could be applied to petitioner because his insanity plea occurred after the effective date of the statute. The court distinguished cases where the statute was not applied because the insanity plea was not entered before the effective date of the statute or was entered under a more onerous statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the retroactive application and the enforcement of the statutes were unconstitutional and would violate their rights to a trial by jury, equal protection, and due process. The state argued that, if the current statute was unconstitutional, then defendants were subject to the former statute. However, the court found that that former statute did not apply to guilty pleas, but only to jury verdicts of guilty. The court therefore held that, since the law clearly prohibited the retroactive application of legislation, and the former statute did not apply to guilty pleas, the finding of the lower court should be affirmed, with remand for resentencing accordingly.</SPAN></P>

The town sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Rockingham County (New Hampshire), which found that a zoning ordinance was invalid and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A master found that an ordinance adopted by the town hindered the construction of multi-family housing units through invocation of subjective criteria for approval of proposed construction by the planning board, and the trial court adopted the master's recommendation that the zoning ordinance be declared invalid, ordering that the builder be awarded a &quot;builder's remedy.&quot; The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed it in part, holding that the zoning ordinance was an invalid exercise of the power delegated to the town pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 674:16-30 because it did not provide for an adequate range of housing types. Further, the court ruled that the trial court's order effectively rezoning the builder's parcel did not violate the separation of powers provision of N.H. Const. part I, art. 37 because as a successful plaintiff found to be committed to the notion of a multi-family development for low-and moderate-income tenants, he was entitled to a &quot;builder's remedy&quot; in the form of being able to build his development as proposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the builder's remedy and reversed it in part. The court allowed the legislative body of the town, within a reasonable time period, to bring the disputed sections of its zoning ordinance into line with the zoning enabling legislation and with the court's opinion. Thus, the court reversed the judgment to the extent it temporarily allowed the zoning ordinance to remain in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for welfare fraud in violation of &sect; 167:17-b, I(d). The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss and denied the State's motion for reconsideration. Upon appeal by the State, the court reversed the order, holding that &sect; 167:17-b, I(d) was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that a statute could be read in the context of related statutes, prior decisions, or generally accepted usage. If read in a commonsense manner together with N.H. Rev. Stat.

The proposed amendments would limit a municipality's liability for damages arising from hazards caused by snow, ice or other inclement weather and would redefine when a municipality would be immune from liability for damages suffered upon certain classes of highways to public waters, respectively. The court answered the questions in the negative. However, the court determined that to the extent that the proposed amendment to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 231:90, I, III, and &sect; 231:92-a gave municipalities immunity for insufficient sidewalks, they were unconstitutional. The court also determined that the amendment proposed to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 231:92, I(b) was unconstitutional insofar as it might be interpreted to apply only to road agents and street commissioners. The court found, however, that a municipality that followed the provisions of proposed N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 231:92-a would satisfy the city's mandate that no municipality be held liable for an insufficiency unless it has had adequate opportunity to respond to it.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the stockholders had not alleged a direct injury as a result of the Public Utilities Commission's decision approving the rate plan and they did not allege a constitutional violation of their rights that was distinguishable from a violation of the rights of the utility company or its other stockholders. However, the court did find that the ratepayers had standing to maintain an action. The court reasoned that the ratepayers would suffer a direct economic injury as a result of the rate plan. Finally, the court found that the ratepayers had failed to sustain their burden and establish that the decision by the PUC was unlawful or unreasonable. The ratepayers argued that the PUC was constitutionally required to apply the traditional ratemaking analysis and failed to do so. The court rejected this argument based on precedent and held that the methodology used in setting the rate was irrelevant. Instead, the court found that it was the result that was important.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state alleged that defendant sexually assaulted his stepdaughter when she was under the age of 16 years old. She was 16 when she reported the offenses. He filed motions for discovery depositions of the victim. The trial court denied them under the N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 517:13 (Supp. 1986) because the statute barred the taking of a deposition of a victim of an alleged criminal offense if the victim was under 16 at the time of the alleged offense. Upon review, the court found that the statute divided similarly situated defendants into two classes: those whose victims were under 16 at the time of the crime and deposition request and those whose victims were under 16 at the time of the crime but over 16 at the time of the deposition request. The court held that there was no rational relationship between denying him the opportunity to depose a victim now over the age 16 and the stated goal of protecting children from repetitive subjection to interrogation without judicial supervision. The court further held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 517:13 only barred the depositions of those victims and witnesses who were under 16 years of age at the time of the discovery deposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated felonious sexual assault upon a victim less than 13 years of age under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 632-A:2(XI) in the Superior Court of Coos County (New Hampshire) after a video tape deposition of the victim was used at trial in lieu of live testimony. Defendant appealed his conviction on the basis that admission of the victim's videotaped testimony violated his right to confront all witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his confrontation rights were violated because the trial court admitted the victim's videotaped testimony taken pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 517:13-a(II) (Supp. 1989) in lieu of her live testimony without finding that the victim was unavailable to testify at trial. The court reversed the conviction. Before a video tape deposition could be admitted, the trial judge had to make a specific finding at the time of trial that the witness continued to be unavailable to testify at trial. If a defendant properly objected to the introduction at trial of the video tape deposition, the proponent of the video tape evidence had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the witness was unavailable in the constitutional sense of the word, as used in confrontation clause jurisprudence, to testify at trial. Because the record did not provide any evidence either of a hearing on defendant's motion to exclude the video tape deposition or of the requisite showing of the victim's unavailability to testify at trial, the court concluded that the state did not meet its burden and that the video tape deposition was not properly admitted as evidence at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Public hearings were held to determine the cost of decommissioning the nuclear power plant. The Committee issued an order finding that the amount of $ 242,429,000 was a reasonable and proper estimate as to the cost of decommissioning the plant, the four percent annual long-run cost escalation rate was an appropriate rate to adjust for inflation, and the payment schedule a witness submitted detailed a reasonable allocation of decommissioning costs between the taxable and tax-exempt owners of the facility. The association claimed that the Committee's findings were not supported by the evidence and that they are unjust and unreasonable. The court held that the association did not meet its burden of showing that the Committee's findings were either unreasonable or unjust, and it failed to present sufficient scientific evidence to support its claims. The association's argument that its constitutional due process rights as guaranteed by both the State and Federal Constitutions were violated by RSA 162-F:15, II (Supp. 1989) (New Hampshire) was not addressed during the course of the hearing or in the Committee's order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix sought damages for the wrongful death of her husband, a fireman killed while on duty. The chief filed a motion to dismiss based on the statutory bar to negligence suits against co-employees found in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281:12, II (1983). The trial court dismissed, but &sect; 281.12, II was later held unconstitutional. The chief then sought a dismissal based on new case law that held that an employee could not sue a co-employee for injuries resulting from negligence where the co-employee was carrying out the employer's nondelegable duty to maintain a safe workplace. The trial court granted the chief's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the administratrix argued that the chief was barred from using the new case law in his defense because the nondelegable duty position should have been raised as an alternate theory when he filed his original motion to dismiss based upon the then valid statutory bar to co-employee negligence suits. The court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the law of the case doctrine did not apply because the issue addressed in the first appeal, the constitutionality of &sect; 281.12, II, was very different from the issue addressed by the new case law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the employer failed to show prejudice by any of the PELRB rulings. The PELRB complied with regulatory, statutory, and constitutional guidelines in arriving at its decisions. The presiding PELRB officer acted in conformity with the requirements of RSA 541-A:17 (Supp. 1989) (New Hampshire) and the PELRB regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress evidence attacked the authorization to seize &quot;other items used in the commission of the crime&quot; as a &quot;general&quot; warrant in contravention of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. XIX and U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV. The trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing, on the prosecutor's representation that the State would not seek to introduce any evidence seized under the &quot;other items&quot; clause, but would offer only the materials taken under the specific authorization to seize blank checks and carbons of checks issued. Accordingly, only the blank checks and carbon copies were entered as exhibits, subject to objection. On appeal, defendant argued that the general authorization to seize &quot;other items used in the commission of the crime&quot; rendered the entire warrant &quot;general,&quot; as outlawed by the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on issuing warrants without particularly describing the persons or things to be seized, and article XIX's prohibition. There was no question that the blank checks and check copies fell within the warrant's specific description of evidence subject to seizure. Accordingly, the motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions to dismiss.

The court held that probable cause existed based on information provided by an informant, couple with police observations, that defendant removed what appeared to be cocaine from inside the rear door panel of his car and transferred items from that location to under the rear seat. Further the court concluded that exigent circumstances existed because defendant was driving the automobile and appeared to have been heading out of the police officer's jurisdiction. The court held that because there was probable cause, coupled with exigent circumstances, the police properly searched the car without obtaining a search warrant.

The town filed a motion to dismiss claiming that (New Hampshire) provided the town with immunity from actions to recover for personal injuries arising out of the ownership, occupation, maintenance, or operation of public sidewalks, streets, or highways. The superior court granted the motion. Plaintiffs appealed. The court found that the superior court erred in granting the town's motion to dismiss predicated on sovereign immunity. The court explained that RSA 507-B:2, I had been found to violate guarantees of equal protection found in part I, articles 2 and 12 of the New Hampshire Constitution. However, the court affirmed the superior court's judgment. The court reasoned that the error in granting the motion to dismiss was harmless because the superior court was nonetheless prepared to grant the town's motion for a directed verdict.

The trial court found in favor of the workers' compensation fund and declared N.H. Rev. Stat.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:3 (1988). Defendant claimed the conviction violated his right to bear arms under N.H. Const. art. 2-A, &sect; 1and his right of due process under N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previously been convicted of burglary and theft by unauthorized taking. He bought a rifle. The rifle was in his possession when he was charged with violating N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:3 (1988). Upon review, the court affirmed. It found that the state constitutional right to bear arms was not absolute. The court determined that &sect; 159:3 was narrowly tailored to serve the significant state interest in protecting human life and property. The state's interest was narrowly served because the statute only prohibited persons who were likely to be dangerous from possessing dangerous weapons. Thus, &sect; 159:3 was constitutional. The court found that defendant was not entitled to a hearing to determine whether his previous felony convictions rendered him too dangerous to possess a rifle. Defendant had no constitutionally guaranteed right to bear arms because he was a convicted felon. Thus, he had no state constitutional due process claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Hampshire House of Representatives requested an opinion from the New Hampshire Supreme Court on the question of whether HB 412-FN-A would have the effect of impermissibly classifying taxpayers under N.H. Const. art. 5, part I and N.H. Const. art. 12, Part II.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the repeal of the provisions of HB 412-FN-A that effectively provided the deduction for compensation expenses would not result in the unconstitutional classification of taxpayers. The court found that the imposition of a tax on business profits would not violate the equality and proportionality requirement of N.H. Const. art. 5, pt. I and N.H. Const. art. 12, pt. II because the provisions of HB 412-FN-A operated with identical effect on all business entities. However, the court also found that tax credit provisions of HB 412-FN-A would result in a violation of N.H. Const. art, 6, pt, II by creating a discriminatory, unreasonable, or disproportionate system of taxation. The court reasoned that the tax credit scheme resulted in disparate numbers of credits to business organizations without regard to income or aggregate reasonable compensation expenses. The court ruled that any credits against business profits taxes were required to be equally available to every type of business organization paying such taxes, including partnerships.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for violations of two ordinances after he urged people to register to vote in the presidential preference primary and espoused the candidacy of an individual. Defendant challenged both the applicability and constitutionality of the ordinance and argued that it should have been read to prohibit only encumbrances that would have actually created impediments to the movement of people or vehicles, of which there was said to be no evidence, and contended that on any other reading the ordinance would unconstitutionally restrict political speech. The court held that one ordinance had no application to the acts charged against defendant and required such charges be dismissed because that ordinance only regulated commercial activity, not individual political activity of the sort in question. However, the conviction under the other ordinance was proper. There was nothing unduly broad about the ordinance that forbid all attachments of notices, posters and signs to public structures, since the evil to be remedied was the visual pollution caused by the attachments themselves and the city did no more than eliminate the exact source of the evil it sought to remedy.</SPAN></P>

The landowners appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that their property was damaged by a culvert positioned in a public way in such a manner as to cause an accumulation of water on their land. The lower court dismissed several counts of the complaint, finding that the town and selectmen were immune from the suit. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The landowners referred alternatively to both negligent and wanton behavior on the part of defendants. There were insufficient allegations of bad faith to take the claims against the selectmen out of the protection of immunity provided by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31:104. However, the town did not have municipal immunity if it negligently installed the culvert in such a way as to invade an adjoining owner's property rights. The landowners did not properly allege a taking because the complaint did not allege either that the town deprived them of all economic use of their land or that the value of the land was substantially destroyed. Finally, the landowners' affidavits created a dispute of fact only concerning whether the town's agent intentionally damaged their boundary wall, but not whether water was intentionally diverted onto their land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing the landowners' complaint was affirmed in part as to allegations of intentional misconduct or negligence against the selectmen, and reversed as to the negligence claims against the town. The order of summary judgment was also affirmed except for the claim of intentional damage to the landowners' boundary wall.</SPAN></P>

The state police delivered the packages to defendant's apartment, posing as a courier. They later entered the apartment subject to a warrant. They found bags of marijuana, documents that indicated that defendant used an Hawaiian address, and large amounts of cash.

The court affirmed the conviction, by holding that the plant quarantine officer's warrantless search of the packages did not violate defendant's rights under N.H.

Defendant notified the police, but reported that two unknown men had broken into his house and beat him. He then filed a claim with his insurer for the value of the stolen property.

Defendant was convicted in connection with the claim based on the fact that he withheld information that was pertinent to the disposition of property that he alleged to have been stolen. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The trial court did not err by admitting evidence of defendant's sexual relationship with the mistress under N.H. R. Evid. 404(b) because it showed defendant's intent and was not being offered to demonstrate defendant's propensity to commit the crime for which he was charged.  N.H. Rev. Stat.

The hospital asserted that the records were privileged under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 151:13-a (Supp. 1988) because they were prepared for the Infections Committee for quality assurance purposes. The trial court ruled that the two documents were not covered by the &sect; 151:13-a privilege because the Infections Committee was not the hospital's &quot;Quality Assurance Committee,&quot; its activities were not limited solely to quality assurance, and the privilege was to be strictly construed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Hampshire Senate certified a question concerning the interpretation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 80:24 and 80:24-a and the interests in real estate that could be sold at a tax sale, the prospective or retrospective application of recent case law regarding such sales, and the constitutionality of a proposed bill to remedy clouds on title created by that case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A dispute arose over the tax collector's practice of conveying by collector's deed a whole parcel of property even when only a fraction of its value was owed in delinquent taxes. Construing &sect;&sect; 80:24 and 80:24-a, the court upheld a challenge to this practice, ruling that only a proportionate share of the estate could be sold, as an undivided interest in common. This decision had the effect of placing a cloud on the titles of properties that had been purchased at such tax sales in the past, such that many property owners who had a tax deed in their chain of title could not sell their properties or obtain financing. The state senate considered a bill to remedy the situation and asked the court to give its opinion as to whether the bill violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23, which prohibited retrospective laws. In response, the court recognized the unsettling effect its decision had and ruled that it had prospective application only. A section of the proposed bill that sought to affirm the validity of prior tax sales, however, was unconstitutional because it violated the contestability of rights granted by statute. Other sections restating existing law were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court responded, inter alia, that the case law at issue had prospective application only and those sections of the proposed bill reemphasizing existing law would be valid under the state constitution, but one section attempting to legislatively eliminate legal defects over all tax sales would invalidly cut off the existing rights of persons to contest them.</SPAN></P>

(N.H. 1989), which eliminated requirements that the State preserve second samples of blood and breath from blood alcohol tests, violated the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, or other provisions of the United States Constitution or the New Hampshire Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed senate bill, S. 144-FN, sought to amend the implied consent law, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 265:86 (1988), by the elimination of the requirement, in driving while intoxicated (DWI) cases, that the State had to preserve a sufficient quantity of blood for a second chemical analysis of a suspect's blood alcohol content. S. 144-FN also sought to eliminate the Cornelius requirement that the state had to preserve a second sample of a suspect's breath if a breathalyzer was used to determine the suspect was intoxicated. The court held that S. 144-FN violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 because it deprived DWI suspects of the Due Process of Law. S. 144-FN was not fundamentally fair because (1) it did not provide suspects with an adequate alternative means of contesting the State's sample, (2) the technology to preserve the second sample already existed at a reasonable cost, (3) prior case law instructed against it, and (4) the legislative history of the implied consent law indicated that fairness required preservation of the second sample. There was no classifications or distinctions under S. 144-FN that implicated equal protection violations.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 168-A:12 (Supp. 1988) which stated that a proceeding could be commenced even though a paternity action was previously filed and dismissed, if such dismissal was based on a statute of limitations of less than 18 years, would have violated N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the application of the limitations period found in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 168-A:12 was not subject to being tolled. The court held that the previous limitations period would have violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because it failed to meet one of the criteria required to survive equal protection analysis: requiring paternity actions to be brought within one or two years does not provide a reasonable opportunity to those with an interest in illegitimate children to bring suit on their behalf. The court found that a putative father who obtained a judgment based on the running of the statute of limitations had the defense of res judicata, and that a statute which divested him of this defense would violate the prohibition against retrospective laws. The court held that since the proposed amendment would have impaired the putative father's right to assert res judicata as a defense, it would violate N.H. Const. part I, art. 23. The court held that the proposed amendment would not violate U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Hampshire Senate adopted a request to ask the court for its opinion on two questions of law involving the constitutionality of a proposed piece of legislation, S.B. 205-FN-A, as amended, which sought to imbue a state energy authority with the power of eminent domain and to establish administrative procedures for determining &quot;just compensation&quot; for acquired public utility companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Specifically, the court's opinion was elicited on the issues of whether provisions of the proposed legislation violated the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and/or N.H. Const. art. 12, pt. I with respect to &quot;just compensation&quot; for &quot;takings&quot; of public utility property by a proposed state energy authority. The court, which considered memoranda submitted by interested parties, determined that application of a provision of the proposed bill, to be codified at new N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 362-B, &sect; 12, established a conclusive presumption concerning the &quot;highest and best use&quot; of property subject to a &quot;taking.&quot; In so doing, it effectively &quot;capped&quot; the value that could be attributed to the property and, therefore, on the condemnee's award. This was interpreted to be an infringement upon constitutional rights. Further, the court found that a second phrase in the resolution, which would require that the agency or jury awarding damages &quot;in all events&quot; consider the impact of utility regulation on the value of the property, also violated both the state constitutional standard and the standard of valuation established by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the State of New Hampshire's legislative power to engage in economic regulation was not sufficiently plenary to justify the imposition of the two valuation provisions incorporated within the proposed legislative enactment and determined that the proposed valuation provisions, under certain factual circumstances, would be violative of state and federal of constitutional standards of &quot;just compensation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to extend the time for filing notice of their claim against the estate, pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:28. The trial court denied their petition on the ground of culpable neglect. They contended that justice and equity required an extension and their failure to file timely was not the result of culpable neglect. Although plaintiffs had brought suit against the estate within one year of the executrix's original grant of administration, as N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:5 requires, they did not provide the executrix notice of claim within six months, as N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:3 required. The court reversed the judgment and held that the trial court had erred, because a plaintiff who had been injured through tortious conduct was under no duty to notify the tortfeasor of her intention to bring suit within the time allowed by the statute of limitations. The very purpose of &sect; 556:28 was to allow certain claims despite a party's failure to meet other statutory requirements. On remand, the trial court was ordered to determine whether plaintiffs were known or reasonably ascertainable creditors whose claim against the estate was more than conjectural.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that he succeeded to his corporation's rights after the corporation was dissolved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation, as part of a development deal, deeded a strip of property along a road to the city. The deed expressly reserved to the corporation the right to reimbursement from certain abutting lot owners when and if they availed themselves of the improvements made by the corporation. The corporation dissolved, the abutting lot owners availed themselves of the improvements, but reimbursement was not forthcoming. In reversing the judgment for the city and remanding the cause, the court held that the action was not subject to the three-year survival limitation on corporate actions under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 294:98, for the reason that the corporation was not a party, and the shareholder succeeded to the corporation's right to reimbursement. The court next held that the city was the party bound to make reimbursement; this was the logical, if implied intendment of the deed. The action was governed by a six-year statute, and accrued not when the deed was given but when the right to reimbursement arose. The shareholder was not entitled to equitable relief given his remedy at law.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 455-A:2, 455:2, which required applicants for the offices of justice of the peace or notary public to be registered voters, violated the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought an opinion about the recently adopted statutes because they had some applicants who had not been registered to vote for the required period. The court responded that the legislature intended N.H. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 455-A:2 to prohibit the Governor from appointing a justice of the peace who had not been a registered voter in the state for the prescribed time. Because neither statute was attacked on grounds of overbreadth or vagueness, the court did not consider whether they were facially unconstitutional. They considered only whether the statutes violated equal protection mandates. Because the classifications did not address a suspect class, the court used the rational basis test. With regard to the office of notary public, because a notary's duties were clerical and ministerial, the voting registration requirement was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. However, a justice of the peace was a judicial offer of inferior rank; thus, the registration requirement had a rational relationship to the state's purpose of appointing persons with knowledge of governmental processes and who cared enough about the process to at least register to vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court provided an opinion in response to the request by the Governor and Executive Council and determined that although a notary public did not have to be a registered voter, it was permissible to require a justice of the peace to be registered to vote.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant owned undeveloped land in a residentially zoned area. However, a wetland conservation area was overlaid on that residential area and, pursuant to &sect; 409.3(b) of the wetlands ordinance, construction of a single-family dwelling was not a permitted use. In order to sell her land to a homebuilder, the applicant sought a variance from &sect; 409.3(b) and N. Hampton, N.H., Zoning Ordinance art. 4, &sect; 410, which imposed a set-back requirement for septic systems. The request for a variance was denied and the applicant appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the applicant failed to demonstrate an unnecessary hardship, so as to qualify for a variance under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 674:33(I)(b), because there were still uses of the property permitted by the zoning ordinance. That such uses were not economically viable was not determinative in deciding whether a hardship existed. Rather, the uniqueness of the land, not the financial circumstances of the owner, determined whether hardship existed. The wetlands ordinance was not unreasonable and the denial of a variance was not a taking of the applicant's land without compensation in violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12.</SPAN></P>

The developer satisfied the requirement by conveying a three-acre lot to the town. The town granted her an order of approval. The developer neither appealed the order of approval, to the extent that it was conditioned on her conveyance to the town, nor took action to protest the dedication requirement. Two years later, in another matter, the court held that requirements such as the town's were unconstitutional. The developer thereafter requested the town to reconvey the lot, and when the town refused, the developer initiated a declaratory judgment action. The trial court held in favor of the town based upon the ground of laches.

Section 541-B, which granted exclusive jurisdiction to hear personal injury actions to a state board of claims, was not unconstitutional even though it did not provide for jury trials in claims over $ 500. N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 20 excepted from its guarantee of jury trials in actions against the State, nor did it prevent the State from retaining its immunity to suit in courts at the same time it waived its immunity to liability in tort by granting jurisdiction to the board of claims. Likewise, the fact that the members of the board of claims were not appointed by the governor and council did not violate N.H. Const. pt. II, art, 46. Finally, sovereign immunity did apply to bar the individual's personal injury action because it the action arose prior to the effective date of the amendments to N.H. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the duty to have maintained a safe workplace rested exclusively on the employer and not the co-employees. The court found that, in executing that duty, the employer necessarily was required to find employees to carry it out. Thus, the court stated that to charge the co-employees with the same duty as the employer would necessarily have sidestepped the workers' compensation law and held the co-employees liable for breach of the same duty already compensated for through the payment of benefits.

The carrier had conducted periodic inspections of that plant. However, the policy explicitly stated that the inspections were not for the benefit of the employees. The administratrices and executrix commenced personal injury actions asserting that the carrier had assumed a duty to inspect the premises. The trial court dismissed the complaints on the ground that they were barred by &sect; 281:12, I. The administratrices and executrix appealed from that decision, which was affirmed. Section 281:12, I provided that an employee was conclusively presumed to have waived his common law causes of action against his employer's insurance carrier. However, the court stated that the abrogation of a common law right was consistent with due process only if an adequate substitute had been provided. The court found that the workers' compensation law provided an adequate remedy and, therefore, concluded that N.H. Rev. Stat.

Their application for unemployment benefits was denied by the department and the denial was upheld by the trial court. The court decided to rule on their claims that the state unemployment statute violated the Rehabilitation Act (Act) among other protections, even though they failed to preserve the issues at trial. The court ruled that before &sect; 504 of the Act was properly applied to invalidate state action denying a benefit, there had to be evidence that was adequate to support a finding that the handicap was the sole reason for the denial. Proof of an exclusive causal link between the handicap and the denial of benefits was a necessary condition for such a finding. The employees did not claim such a handicap. They only testified that they did not dare work more than four hours a day, presumably because of their age. They also did not claim that old age amounted to a handicap within the meaning of &sect; 706(8)(B)(i). Further, the requirement in N.H. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the imposition of consecutive sentences for first degree assault and the felonious use of a firearm violated the double jeopardy provision of N.H. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1, and that the warrantless search of his apartment violated his due process rights. The court reversed the felonious firearm use conviction, holding that but for his use of a handgun, defendant would have been charged with simple assault, a misdemeanor; hence, to upgrade the charge to first degree assault as a result of the use of a gun and then to impose an additional penalty for the felonious use of a firearm was to punish him twice for the same offense. However, the court affirmed the assault conviction and upheld the warrantless search, finding that the probable cause requirements for a warrantless entry in exigent circumstances were satisfied. There was evidence tracking the defendant to his apartment. That, in combination with the police awareness of the shooting and the swiftness with which the police were able to obtain the evidence upon which they relied, were sufficient to constitute probable cause for a warrantless entry of defendant's apartment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Board's findings were inadequate as a matter of law to support the imposition of penalties under Chapter 318 and under the rulings that the Board cited as the alleged authority for the disciplinary action. Further, the court found that by failing to specify charges against the pharmacists in the manner that was proscribed by the administrative procedure act, the Board failed to conform to the requirements of the administrative procedure act for the conduct of an adjudicative proceeding; for that reason as well, the Board's orders were vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A company, which was constructing a nuclear plant, petitioned the commission for an emergency rate surcharge and a special emergency rate of return.

Ann. &sect; 378:30-a to the fixing of electric utility rates in an emergency rate proceeding. The court remanded. The application of the anti-CWIP law was constitutional and would not have violated either the state or the federal constitutions. The anti-CWIP statute reaffirmed the &quot;used and useful&quot; concept, which required that the direct consequences of investment risk for new plants had to be borne by investors, not ratepayers. Changes in risk allocation were policy matters for the legislature rather than constitutional matters for the courts. The court's interpretation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 378:30-a, 378:9 did not produce an illogical result, but a consistent one.

The Hillsborough County Superior Court (New Hampshire) granted the employer's motion to dismiss based on N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 281:12, the workers' compensation exclusive remedy statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spouse argued that &sect; 281:12 was unconstitutional under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 14 because it eliminated a cause of action previously available to spouses of injured employees without providing an adequate quid pro quo. She noted that a 1971 amendment to the statute had eliminated the then-existing cause of action for loss of consortium. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. It overruled a holding in an earlier case, Estabrook v. American Hoist &amp; Derrick, Inc., 127 N.H. 162, 178, 498 A.2d 741, 751 (1985), to the extent that the holding could be interpreted as requiring that a restrictive amendment to the Workers' Compensation Law must be supported by a contemporaneously enacted provision for a new benefit.

The arrearage arose because the wife had been receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children.

The Governor and Council filed a resolution with the court questioning the constitutionality of the footnotes. The court replied as follows: (1) once an appropriation for the executive branch was made, the requirement of fiscal committee approval of contracts made pursuant thereto by the executive branch was an unconstitutional intrusion into the executive branch; (2) executive powers were inappropriately sought to be conferred on the legislature; and (3) the legislature had sufficient power at its disposal to act as a legislative watchdog without intruding on the executive's discretion for the expenditure of funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the petition for a writ of certiorari, the court was asked to determine whether differential pay scales applied to academic employees depending upon their date of hire deny. The court held that the employees were entitled to retroactive pay for time worked in the class from September 3, 1975, until June 15, 1979. The court held that grandfathering was a practical way of easing the transition to the new pay schedule, and that the classifications at issue were rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Upon close examination of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 98:13, XIII, the court concluded that the tripartite pay schedule created by the director of personnel failed to provide the employees with equal pay for equal work. The pay schedule was not equitably applied to all employees within the same classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the Commission was affirmed in part and reversed in part with an order that employees recover retroactive pay.</SPAN></P>

The officer contended the trial court had no jurisdiction because his only contact with the state was in his capacity as a corporate officer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was killed in an accident on the job. His estate sued the officer, alleging that the officer had a duty of reasonable care to provide a safe plant, that he breached that duty, and that the breach caused the death. While the officer conceded that New Hampshire law allowed the estate to bring an action against a co-employee, he contended that because the corporation was domiciled in another state, he was protected from the application of the long arm statute,&nbsp;N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 510:4, and by the fiduciary shield doctrine, which held that the acts a corporate employee performed in his corporate capacity generally did not form the basis for jurisdiction in an individual capacity. On appeal, the court held that the doctrine was not applicable because his position as safety officer brought him into the state, his duties were such that he knew or should have known that his conduct would have a direct, substantial effect on the employee, and he intended his conduct to have such an effect within the state. Further, the state had a strong interest in providing a forum, and the officer would not be unduly inconvenienced by having to defend himself within the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Hampshire House of Representatives filed a resolution requesting an opinion of the court on the constitutionality of House Bill 70 (H.R. 70, 1987 Leg. (N.H. 1987)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">House Bill 70, if enacted, would prohibit homosexual persons from being foster parents, adoptive parents, or child care agency operators. The court considered only prospective application of the exclusions. The court applied the rational relationship test for both federal and state equal protection analysis because homosexuals were not a suspect class. The court held that the legislature's interest in providing role models for children provided a rational basis on which to exclude homosexuals from participation therein, because it was in the familial context that the theory of learned sexual preference was most likely to be true. However, the court was not satisfied that the theory would provide a rational basis for a blanket exclusion of all homosexuals from being day care center operators or other non-full-time child caretakers. Such cases must be the subject of specific determinations by licensing authorities. The court also held that House Bill 70 would not violate the due process clause of either the federal or state constitution because there was no cognizable liberty or property interest in becoming a foster parent or in adopting a child, and thus no entitlement thereto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">House Bill 70 was constitutional as applied to adoption and the licensing of foster parents, but would be unconstitutional in the day care context. The court declined to answer the question regarding the classification of children. The court answered the remaining questions in the negative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A complaint was filed against defendant, charging him with violating a city ordinance that made unlawful the operation of any musical instrument or device in such manner as to disturb the peace. The ordinance further provided that the operation of any such instrument or device by a commercial establishment in such a manner as to be plainly audible outside of the physical limits of the building or structure in which it was located was prima facie evidence of a violation of the ordinance. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court held that the ordinance was invalid because it exceeded the city's delegated authority under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:17(II). The court found that &sect; 47:17(II) empowered the city to prevent unreasonable noise and disturbance to people who were occupying property in which they had an interest or such other public or private premises as they might lawfully visit, but that it was not intended to empower cities to regulate sound that neither penetrated beyond the boundaries of the noisemaker's own premises nor constituted an unreasonable disturbance to people lawfully on those premises; thus, the ordinance exceeded the city's authority.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the denial of both motions and found that, although defendant could request a videotaped deposition under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 517:13-a (Supp. 1986), he was not entitled to a regular deposition under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 517:13 (Supp. 1986). Between the alleged assaults and his indictment, &sect; 517:13 was amended to prohibit discovery depositions of a victim or witness who was under the age of 16 when the alleged offense was committed, and the court ruled that the superior court had applied &sect; 517:13 properly. The court found that the amendment was not an ex post facto law because it represented merely a remedial or procedural change in the law. Amended &sect; 517:13 did not violate due process, because discovery depositions were not necessarily essential to his adequate trial preparation, and did not violate equal protection principles because it had a rational relationship to the effectuation of a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

The property owners contended that the district's imposition of water rates, fees, and ad valorem taxes was contrary to N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12 and that their voting rights under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 1 were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district imposed the water rates, fees, and taxes after purchasing a water company and a golf course from a private owner. Voting at the district's meetings was limited to the 10 percent of the property owners who resided in the district. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the water rates, fees, and ad valorem taxes imposed by the district did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12. The court found that the district's calculation of the charges and the tax was not arbitrary or unreasonable in relation to the benefits of having the water system in the district. The court further held that the property owners were not deprived of the right to vote in violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 1. The court stated that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 670:30 validly prescribed bona fide residency as among a legal voter's qualifications, and the district was not a &quot;special limited purpose municipal district&quot; in which voting rights would be determined by property ownership rather than residency.

He also participated in and promoted child pornography in which the girls appeared. The police department conducted an investigation that included questioning the girls and defendant. Pursuant to a search warrant, they searched the residence where the girls had stayed for one week after they first ran away and seized an envelope containing photographs that graphically depicted the sexual exploitation involved. Defendant filed pre-trial motions to suppress evidence seized during the search of the residence and for a bill of particulars in regard to the felonious sexual assault indictment. The motions were denied, and defendant was convicted based on the testimony of the girls and two men who paid the girls in exchange for sex. In affirming the convictions, the court found that under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 645:2, I(b), the state was not required to prove defendant received consideration; the testimony of the girls and the men was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the illegal acts; and failure to name a precise date in the indictment was not an error.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 541-A:7 challenging the validity of two administrative rules of defendant, the New Hampshire Air Resources Commission (commission), which prohibited the open burning of waste. A master upheld the rules. The trial court, Merrimack County (New Hampshire) approved the master's recommendations. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State administrative rules prohibited open burning. The towns had conceded that the commission's rules were valid to the extent that they applied to open-burning dumps that emitted &quot;air pollution.&quot; Their sole challenge was to the rules as applied to dumps that did not cause air pollution. The towns alleged in their petition that their dumps did not cause air pollution, but they claimed that the rules would require them to increase their annual expenditures for waste disposal by up to 800 percent. The towns argued that they had standing to challenge the rules as they applied to open-burning dumps that did not cause air pollution. The commission had denied that the towns' dumps did not cause air pollution. That denial created a factual issue on which the towns had the burden of proof. The court vacated the trial court's order and dismissed the petition. The court held that in a declaratory judgment action, where facts had to be ascertained in order to determine the legal rights of the parties, the trial court had to try the factual issues. Therefore, the trial court should have dismissed the petition for declaratory judgment and not ruled on the merits.</SPAN></P>

In his appeal, defendant challenged the statute on state and federal due process grounds and alleged that the element of control in the statute was vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was at work, pursuant to a search warrant, firearms were removed from his residence. The police were informed that the guns belonged to defendant. Defendant was convicted of a weapons offense, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159:3 (1985), which made it illegal for a convicted felon to have under his control a firearm or any other dangerous weapon. Defendant argued that because he was not in the proximity of the weapons when he was arrested, he was not in control of them. The court disagreed. The court held that the statute was sufficiently clear to withstand a facial attack on the grounds of overbreadth or vagueness. The plain purpose of the statute was to impose upon convicted felons prescribed sanctions when they dealt with weapons described by the statute. Significantly, the statute outlawed both ownership and possession, in addition to control. The legislature carefully delineated the prescribed conduct. Because the statute was not lacking in clarity or precision, and was not unnecessarily broad or invasive, it was upheld. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The motor carriers contended that the statute violated the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it discriminated against out of-state businesses by imposing highway use permits on certain out-of-state motor vehicles. The motor carriers sought refunds of all taxes imposed pursuant to &sect; 260:53. The trial court approved an agreement to hold in escrow taxes collected pursuant to &sect; 260:53. The court concluded that &sect; 260:53 violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because it discriminated against interstate commerce and because the taxes it authorized were not fairly related to services provided to out-of-state vehicles by New Hampshire. The court concluded that the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1, did not apply because the common carriers were not citizens. The court determined that the motor carriers were not entitled to any refunds, beyond the amounts held in escrow, because there was no statutory or common law right to such refunds.</SPAN></P>

The department claimed that &quot;gross business profits&quot; under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 77-A:1 (Supp. 1985) included profits paid out by a real estate investment trust (REIT) as dividends to its shareholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an audit on the business profits tax returns of the taxpayer, a REIT, the department assessed an additional tax because the taxpayer had not included the dividends distributed to shareholders in its gross business profits. The director of the audit division upheld the assessment, and the taxpayer appealed for a trial de novo in the trial court. The trial court declared the assessment null and void, and the department appealed. It claimed that the trial court misconstrued &quot;gross business profits&quot; in the New Hampshire business profits tax statute, ch. 77-A, as applied to REITS. The court affirmed the trial court, explaining that it had properly interpreted N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-A:1(III(a)) (Supp. 1975) literally to mean that gross business profits equaled whatever amount appeared on line 28 of the federal corporate income tax form. Line 28 of that form was labeled, &quot;taxable income before net operating loss deduction and special deductions.&quot; Thus, &sect; 77-A:1(III9a)) directed the taxpayer, in preparing its state business profits tax return, to transcribe the amount shown on line 28 of the federal form, and this was what the taxpayer had done.</SPAN></P>

The administratrix appealed from a summary judgment entered by the trial court in favor of the hospital in the administratrix's contract action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an earlier decision, the court held that the administratrix's wrongful death action was barred by the then-controlling two-year statute of limitations, N.H.

Accordingly, the administratrix timely filed a motion for a new trial, which was granted by the trial court. On appeal, the court held that reliance by the administratrix's counsel on the constitutionality of the two-year statute of limitations constituted accident, mistake, or misfortune within the meaning of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 526:1. Therefore, the administratrix was entitled to a new trial in light of the court's ruling that the two-year limitations period was unconstitutional. The court deemed the administratrix's contract claim waived because her counsel had stipulated that there was no need to pursue the contract action if the wrongful death action was permitted to proceed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Concord District Court transferred two questions without ruling: whether a minor charged with a misdemeanor traffic offense could have been prosecuted and, if convicted, incarcerated as an adult under the authority of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-B:32 (Supp. 1985); and, if so, whether application of the statute in such a case offended standards of equal protection or resulted in the imposition of cruel, unusual, and disproportionate punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At age 16, defendant was charged with motor vehicle violations, which were treated as adult misdemeanor complaints under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-B:32 (Supp. 1985) and therefore subject to adult penalties. The staff of the house of correction, which did not contain segregated quarters for juveniles, refused to admit him. A hearing followed in the district court, which treated the county as an intervenor. The county and defendant argued that &sect; 169-B:32 either was inapplicable to motor vehicle misdemeanors or would be unconstitutional if so applied. The state argued for the applicability and constitutionality of the statute. After criticizing the procedural posture of the case, the court considered the scope of &sect; 169-B:32. The court rejected the argument of defendant and the county that the legislature intended minors over 16 to be treated as adults in motor vehicle cases only when charged with a violation that carried no possibility of incarceration. The court held that the statute did not violate the defendant's right to the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by N.H. Const. art. 12, pt. I and by the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the questions posed by the district court. The court held that a minor charged with a misdemeanor traffic offense could have been prosecuted and incarcerated as an adult under the authority of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-B:32 (Supp. 1985). There was no constitutional bar to the application of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-B:32.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the trial court's conviction of defendant, he argued that the trial court erred in denying his request for a continuance, that the phrase &quot;under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life,&quot; in the context of the assault statute was unconstitutionally vague, that there was insufficient evidence to show that defendant acted with extreme indifference to human life, and that the trial court's jury instructions were misleading. Affirming the trial court's judgment of conviction, the court held that it was not an abuse of discretion in denying defendant's request for a continuance for the purpose of jury selection. The delay would have thrown the court calendar in disarray, the public defender had ample time to prepare, and the case was not so complex as to require extraordinary amounts of time to prepare for jury selection. The court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 631 was not void for vagueness. Furthermore, the evidence was sufficient to prove that he acted with extreme indifference to human life because the particular assault actually committed did not have to be life threatening to support such a finding.</SPAN></P>

The driver of the car failed to negotiate a curve and the car overturned. The administrator's daughter died in the accident and the brother and sister were injured. Plaintiffs filed suit against the city, alleging that its officers were negligent for failing to arrest the teenagers. The administrator recovered nothing because the jury found that the decedent was 55 percent at fault. The jury found that the brother and sister were 50 percent and 45 percent at fault, respectively, and reduced their damage awards accordingly. The court affirmed, holding, inter alia (1) the officers were negligent because they had a duty to arrest the teens under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 180:2 and they violated their common law duty of due care, (2) the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the officers' conduct proximately caused the sister's injuries, and (3) N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The third party filed a complaint against the inmate to recover damages for a debt, and the parties stipulated for docket markings. The third party filed a petition for contempt pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 524:6-a (Supp. 1985) to enforce the judgment that the inmate failed to pay. The superior court denied the inmate's motions for appointment of an attorney and declined his offer to submit to a financial investigation. At the show cause hearing, the court imposed the contested order even though the inmate claimed that he secured employment to pay-off the judgment. The court vacated the contested order and remanded the matter to proceed pursuant to the opinion. The superior court was reversed because it violated &sect; 524:6-a in failing to set a repayment schedule for the inmate based on his representations of employment, which denied him due process of law. The court held that the civil contempt proceedings against the inmate occurred pursuant to &sect; 524:6-a. The court decided that contempt in these circumstances was the violation of the court's order under &sect; 524:6-a, not the breach of the stipulation.

That court found that the regulation of speech proposed in the bill was too broad, as it would prohibit mere expressions of a particular point of view. The court concluded that the bill was not a valid time, place, or manner regulation because it discriminated among points of view. The bill was also too vague because it provided little or no notice to an individual of ordinary intelligence as to what activity would come within its proscriptions. Further, critical terms in the bill were left undefined and could therefore be used to sweep whole categories of protected speech into its ambit.</SPAN></P>

The attorney alleged that the board's decision to oppose the tort reform legislation exceeded its constitutional purpose and violated the First Amendment. The court held that, in light of concerns for First Amendment liberties, the phrase &quot;administration of justice&quot; in the bar association's constitution required a narrow interpretation. The court held that the bar association's activities were limited to those directly related to the administration of the judicial system and the regulation of the legal profession, and the board's opposition to tort reform was not within the mandate of its constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before an adjudicatory hearing on delinquency charges, the district court denied the counsel's motion for approval to hire, at public expense, a psychologist as an expert and a court reporter, noting that the counsel could obtain the services of a psychologist from the local community mental health agency and that the hearing would be tape recorded. The counsel used a court reporter and called the psychologist whom he had engaged. The district court dismissed 9 of the 11 charges and rejected the counsel's bill for reimbursement, although acknowledging that the psychologist's testimony was dispositive. The court noted N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 604-A: 6 (Supp. 1983) authorized reimbursement, but that it was not a taking of a defense counsel's financial resources to deny reimbursement for unnecessary or unnecessarily expensive defense costs.The court affirmed in part, holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing the request for expenses for the court reporter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the administrator of the estate of deceased physician and a medical center, filed a motion to dismiss the medical malpractice action brought by plaintiffs, an injured child and her parents, on the grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations and by the bringing of the action against the administrator. The Superior Court of Hillsborough County (New Hampshire) made an interlocutory transfer without ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:11 permitted their action to be brought without being barred by the statute of limitations, and that relief could be provided pursuant to N.Y. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:28 if their claim were considered to be late. In making its review under the interlocutory transfer, the court construed N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:11 to provide that an action could be brought at any time within six years after the death of a deceased party. The court determined that while N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 556:1, :3, :5, were designed to secure the speedy settlement of estates, the administration of the decedent's estate was not yet closed and plaintiffs' claim against the estate had been amended to the amount of liability insurance coverage. The court found that there was evidence that plaintiffs were not guilty of culpable neglect in bringing their action, but that this was a factual issue to be determined on remand. The court held that if the finding on remand were in favor of plaintiffs on culpable neglect, then N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556:28 could be applied to relieve them of the strictures of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 556:1, :3, :5.</SPAN></P>

At his trial for first degree murder, the state introduced evidence that shortly before the attack on the victim, defendant had accosted another woman and stabbed her with a knife. Defendant was convicted of the murder and sought review. The court affirmed. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to show premeditation. The court rejected this argument, finding that defendant had driven to the shopping area armed with a concealed knife, which indicated an intent to kill uncooperative victims. The court stated that although defendant did not have a particular victim in mind, the evidence of a deliberate intent to kill someone was sufficient to sustain his conviction. Defendant next argued that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence of the earlier assault. The court held that the evidence was properly admitted to show proof of motive or intent, noting that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the limited use it could make of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the Commission's findings were deemed prima facie lawful and reasonable, and appellate relief required a showing by a clear preponderance of the evidence that an action was unjust or unreasonable. The court held that the group failed to make such a showing. The court could not conclude that the Commission's findings as to completion cost and resulting total cost, relative economic desirability and technical feasibility of proposed alternatives, the need for power, and the reasonableness of resulting rates were unreasonable. The court found a clear evidentiary basis for calculations. The court held that the failure to consider the lower end of the probable rate range did not warrant reversal because the Commission found the maximum extent of rate base exclusion that would allow avoidance of bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>

The court answered the questions by holding that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 253:56, which addressed the suspension or revocation of a driver's license for cause, was unconstitutional and N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 263:76, providing for an appeal from the revocation or suspension, was constitutional. The court held that N.H. Rev. Stat.

The court also held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 263:76 was constitutional because the elimination of arbitrary and standardless action at the administrative level under N.H. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incorporated association of owners of lots in a subdivision (lot owners) claimed damages after the town refused to lay out certain roads. The lot owners claimed that this refusal infringed upon their rights to equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed by the New Hampshire Constitution. The lot owners argued that an action for damages should lie against a municipality and its officials when those officials have acted under color of law and with discriminatory intent to subject any person to a denial of the equal protection laws. The superior court dismissed the lot owners' action. On appeal, the court stated that a damages remedy was not appropriate because the existing statutory law provided an adequate remedy for the citizen injured by the refusal of the selectmen to lay out roads. The court also held that mandamus relief was not appropriate because the selectmen had not entirely failed or refused to address the lot owners' requests for layout.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence seized by the police incident to his arrest on the ground that the police failed to comply with the &quot;knock and announce rule.&quot; The trial court denied the motion. Defendant then filed a motion to reconsider in which he alleged that his arrest under a preexisting bench warrant was improper since it was a pretext to question him regarding the sexual assault. The trial court also denied this motion. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction because the police officers' failure to announce their identity and purpose fell under a &quot;useless gesture&quot; exception to the knock and announce rule. It would have been useless for the officers to have made an announcement because their knocking failed to rouse defendant, whom the officers could see lying on a couch inside the house, apparently asleep. Furthermore, defendant's arrest on a pre-existing bench warrant was not a sham or a pretext, and the arrest was valid under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19.

He appealed, asserting insufficient evidence, and that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that for the alleged penetration to be criminal, it must have been for the purpose of sexual arousal. The court affirmed. It noted that defendant presented testimony to prove that the sexual penetration occurred accidentally, and the state offered testimony to show that defendant's penetration was intentional. The jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant's penetration of the baby was intentional and for no legitimate purpose. Thus, the court could not say that no rational person could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty as charged. Defendant was not entitled to the requested jury instruction because sexual assault was not a lesser-included offense of aggravated felonious sexual assault. Although the trial court erred in instructing the jury that sexual assault was a lesser-included offense, the error did not require reversal.</SPAN></P>

She based her objection on the ground that the introduction of the evidence of refusal violated her privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Defendant's argument was that her refusal was compelled because the state imposed upon her the obligation to choose between submitting to a test by providing a sample or refusing to do so. Since both alternatives were bad from her standpoint, she argued that her choice was not free but compelled. The court found that the trial court did not err when it admitted testimony about defendant's refusal to submit to the testing. There was no good reason in general constitutional principle, in the particular facts of the testing procedures, or in constitutional history to classify defendant's refusal as compelled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant was convicted for operating a motor vehicle after revocation of his driver's license. The other defendants were convicted for selling drugs to a police informer. Defendants timely appealed their convictions and the court declined acceptance of their appeals under N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 7. Defendants filed motions for reconsideration by the court. The court held that Rule 7 did not violate defendants' rights to due process, equal protection, or the right to the effective assistance of counsel. The court reasoned that all defendants were afforded the same opportunity to have their cases accepted and obtain an adjudication on the merits of the appeal and that under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 14, limitations on access to courts was permissible so long as it was not arbitrary or capricious. The court determined that the limitation to access permitted by N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 7 was not arbitrary or capricious because it was rationally related to equitably and effectively discharging its responsibilities. The court noted that it would have reached the same conclusions under federal constitutional analysis of the issue.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment against defendant in part on the issue of an unconstitutional sentence and remanded the case for sentencing. The court held that a sentence of life imprisonment with a minimum term of 35 years was disproportionate to the offense of second-degree murder under the statute that was applicable at the time the offense was committed. The court affirmed the judgment as to all other issues. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial because he produced no evidence that he was prejudiced by a reference in a prosecutor's opening statement to defendant's name change. The court also concluded that dismissal of the indictment was not required for the state's failure to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. Defendant had waived his right to appeal on the issue and he had not overcome the presumption of regularity that attached to grand jury proceedings.

The court reversed the trial court's judgments. The court held that the provision was unconstitutional, except when liability rested on acts performed by a defendant as the alter ego of a corporate employer while performing a corporate responsibility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant based each request on a 191-day delay in filing the presentence psychiatric report in the criminal case, in violation of the statutory mandate that such a psychiatric evaluation be completed within 90 days from the order requiring it. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 173-A:3, repealed by 1983 N.H. Laws 206:1. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that since the post-conviction psychological evaluation had no bearing or effect on the determination of guilt or innocence, delay beyond the statutory evaluation period did not, without more, have any bearing on the validity of the conviction itself. The court found that since delay likewise had no apparent bearing on the soundness of any conclusions reached in the psychiatric evaluation, delay did not have any effect on the use that the state might make of a report of such an evaluation. The court ruled, thus, there was no reason to vacate an apparently sound adjudication, or to deprive the state and defendant of any value that the examination and report may have in the future.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Strafford County (New Hampshire) entered a judgment against the town. The town challenged the denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), its motion to limit the recovery of damages pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The improper application of handcuffs by a newly hired police officer resulted in the partial disability of the arrestee. The officer received the handcuffs upon entering the police force prior to any training or supervision regarding either when or how to use them. Affirming the trial court's decision denying the town's motion for JNOV, the court held that: (1) the negligence of the police officers was not a necessary legal prerequisite to a finding of negligence in hiring, training and supervision on the part of the town; and (2) the jury charge was adequate to convey the arrestee's theory of negligent hiring and supervision. Reversing the decision denying the town's motion to limit the amount of damages, the court held that, at the time of the motion, the town was without any insurance coverage adequate to satisfy the judgment against it and thus the statutory limit under &sect; 507-B was applicable. The court remanded the award of costs for clarification, finding that an allowance for expert witness fees incurred for pretrial work was not permissible under N.H. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician raised a variety of due process and procedural issues concerning the revocation of the physician's license to practice medicine. The court concluded that the board committed reversible error in considering a complaint over nine years old and in denying the physician an open hearing. The court determined that the nine-year delay prejudiced the physician's ability to defend the accusations. According to the court, the challenged procedures concerned a legally protected interest, the physician's property right in his license to practice medicine, and the procedures did not afford the appropriate procedural safeguards. The court held that the private interest affected by the governmental action was substantial, that there was a risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and that the government's interest did not outweigh the physician's interest. Finally, the court held that the board erred in denying the physician an open hearing. According to the court, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 329:17, X, provided for an open hearing before the board if so requested by the physician.</SPAN></P>

The court answered in the affirmative. The court found that many of the items in the bill were unobjectionable under art. 18-a in that they were provisions establishing, amending or repealing operating and capital expenses for the three branches of government. The court found that they explained the text of the appropriations and operating expenses or constituted financial management of budget entries, without effectuating any changes to general statutory law. The court concluded that art. 18-a was not offended by the use of budget sections to attach certain conditions to expenditures or to make fiscal events contingent upon certain happenings, so long as the sections did not effectuate a change in general statutory law. The court concluded that art. 18-a made clear that the constitutional amendment was proposed to prohibit footnotes or sections altering general statutory law from being inserted into budget bills.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three years after her husband's death, the administratrix filed tort and contract claims against defendants.

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the breach of implied contract claim was, in substance, a tort claim and, thus, was barred along with the other claims, unless &sect; 556.11 did not apply; (2) N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 556.11 (Supp. 1983), which provided a six-year limitations period, did not apply retrospectively to the administratrix's claims because retrospective application would impair defendants' vested right to assert the limitations defense; and (3) N.H. Rev. Stat.

The county attorney filed a petition for the patient's involuntary admission to the hospital. The probate court granted the petition and involuntarily committed the patient pursuant to N.H. Rev.

The court held that the evidence supported the finding that his mental condition created a potentially serious likelihood of danger to himself and others. The patient was diagnosed with atypical bipolar disorder, he suffered from hallucinations, refused to obey the police and instead threatened and assaulted them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner challenged the City's denial of a superstructure permit and the concomitant forced halt to his building plans. The superior court transferred to the court the questions of whether the City violated the constitutional prohibition against retrospective laws pursuant to N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23, or the public hearing requirement of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31:63 (Supp. 1983), current version at N.H. Rev. Stat.

The court found that the City's adoption of the statute was constitutionally and statutorily valid, and answered each question in the negative. The court held that to be retrospective, a statute had to impair a vested legal right, and no rights in the proposed construction vested in the property owner. Furthermore, the court held that because the property owner did not allege that the zoning deliberations extended beyond a reasonable time, &sect; 156:3a, as adopted by the City, was not a zoning ordinance and therefore was not subject to the public hearing requirement of N.H.

Upon review, the court affirmed the department's decisions in part, reversed them in part, and remanded the cases to the department for further proceedings. The court held that a taxable meal was one prepared for human consumption by a restaurant, that the vending machines were restaurants within the meaning of the statute, and that prepackaged meals were not exempt from the tax. The court ruled that the department's policy of taxing prepackaged food purchased from vending machines but not from supermarkets violated N.H. Const. part I, arts. 1, 12; N.H.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their judgments of conviction of driving after revocation by the trial court in Carroll County (New Hampshire). The question presented for review was whether the revocation of a license automatically terminated at the end of the court-ordered period of license deprivation or whether it remained in effect until defendants retained their licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of driving while intoxicated and their licenses were suspended. At the expiration of the suspension period the department of motor vehicles sent notices setting forth the requirements for restoration of their licenses. Neither defendant took the necessary steps to regain his license and eventually both were arrested and convicted of driving after revocation. Subsequent to the trial court's judgments of conviction, they appealed arguing that they could not be convicted of driving after revocation or suspension because the period of license deprivation had expired. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that defendants were adequate given notice of the requirements that needed to be fulfilled in order to regain their license under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 263:64 (Supp. 1983) and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendants also claimed that &sect; 263:64 (Supp. 1983) did not become effective until approximately three months after their arrests and did not apply.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the residents placed a mobile home on their lot without first obtaining a special exception, the town petitioned the superior court to order them to remove the mobile home.

The superior court approved the report. Upon review, the court reversed the decision. The court held that &sect; 4.13 of the town's zoning ordinance violated their equal protection rights as guaranteed by the state constitution. In subjecting the ordinance to a middle tier level of review, the court held that the town's zoning ordinance relating to the location of mobile homes, as it was worded, did not bear a fair and substantial relation to its goal of retaining the rural character of the town.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was interviewed by the police about a murder investigation and was told that he was a suspect. The questions included an inquiry about an airplane accident. Defendant claimed that a former employee was a passenger with defendant at the time of the crash. After the interview, defendant contacted that person and asked him to tell the police that he was the passenger in the plane. Defendant was subsequently indicted for and convicted of witness tampering, contrary to &sect; 641:5, I(a). On appeal, the court affirmed. It declined to consider defendant's estoppel argument because the defense was not raised during the trial. The conviction was not improper just because the person defendant talked to was not a witness or informant. The title appended to &sect; 641:5, I(a), which mentioned witnesses and informants, was not dispositive of its clear meaning. In addition, there was no need for the false information sought to be provided to be material to an investigation and the trial court correctly instructed the jury that proof of materiality was not required. Finally, &sect; 641:5, I(a) was neither vague nor overbroad because of its reference to a &quot;person,&quot; rather than a witness or informant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When her son was seven months old, the mother was hospitalized and the son was taken into custody by the State Division of Welfare. Although the child was briefly returned to the mother, custody was awarded to the division. The mother missed a number of scheduled visits with the child before she was hospitalized a year later and diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia. The mother remained hospitalized more than two years later when the division petitioned to terminate her parental rights. On appeal, the court found that the division satisfied its obligation under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-C:2, II(b) (Supp. 1983) to assist the mother in retaining custody of her son by arranging visits and by relying on a state health facility to undertake treatment of the mother's mental disorder. Testimony at the hearing by two psychologists established that the mother was not capable of caring for her son, that another two years could pass before she would be able to be a parent, and that the son had bonded to his foster parents during the three years he had been in their care. Holding that the mother's illness caused harm to the child, the court affirmed the order terminating her parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the assault indictment alleged that defendant used a &quot;deadly weapon,&quot; the robbery indictment under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 636:1 (Supp. 1983) alleged only that he used a &quot;blunt instrument&quot; during the offense. At trial, evidence was presented that a man with a bag over his head beat a store owner with a piece of wood while demanding money. A police officer testified that, when defendant was arrested, his clothing fit a description given by two bystanders who did not testify. Defendant was found guilty of assault and armed robbery as a class A felony and he appealed. The court ruled that, under the Blockburger test, conviction of both offenses did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Also, the evidence was sufficient to convict. Reversal was required, however, because the bystanders' description of the assailant was inadmissible hearsay and, because it was crucial in linking defendant to the robbery, its introduction was not harmless. Moreover, he could not be found guilty of a class A felony under &sect; 636:1(III) for using a deadly weapon during the robbery because the robbery indictment did not specify the use of a deadly weapon and, thus, charged only a class B felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, the first defendant sought review after he was convicted by a jury in the Hillsborough County Superior Court (New Hampshire) of negligent homicide in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.30:3, II. The second defendant appealed after he was convicted by a jury in the Rockingham County Superior Court (New Hampshire) of negligent homicide in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.30:3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The central question on appeal was whether the State must have proved the elements of criminal negligence as defined by the Criminal Code, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 626.2, II(d), to sustain a conviction under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 630:3, II, a provision of the negligent homicide statute. The court held that the culpability requirement of negligent homicide was satisfied upon proof of the fault element of &sect; 630:3, II, that a person operated a propelled vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. In order to sustain a conviction under &sect; 630:3, II, the State must have established a causal connection between the person's driving under the influence, the subsequent collision, and the resulting death. The court held that &sect; 630:3, II was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The language of the statute gave clear notice that the act of driving an automobile while under the influence, with death resulting as a consequence of the act, was proscribed conduct. In affirming, the court held that the warrantless taking of blood without the second defendant's consent, after he was arrested, was constitutional because probable cause existed to justify the warrantless search.</SPAN></P>
