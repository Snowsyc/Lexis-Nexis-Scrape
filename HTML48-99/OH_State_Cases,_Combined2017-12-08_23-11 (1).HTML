</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sua sponte reconsidered its prior unreported decision interpreting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 in pari materia with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.60 to allow plaintiff driver to petition for occupational driving privileges under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.60 enacted the Driver's License Compact in Ohio, and the court's decision was based on the mistaken belief that Kentucky was also a Compact state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted in Kentucky for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Because Kentucky was not in fact a member of the Driver's License Compact, the court held that its previous decision improperly applied Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4507.60 in this case. The driver had initiated a complaint below to enjoin imposition of his administrative license suspension in Ohio based on his Kentucky DUI conviction. The trial court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 violated the Equal Protection Clause, concluding that there was no rational basis for providing occupational driving privileges to Ohio residents who had been cited for DUI in Compact states, while not providing Ohio residents cited in non-Compact states with the same opportunity. The State failed to point out any rational basis to the court for treating an Ohio resident convicted of DUI in a state not a member of the Compact any differently from an Ohio resident convicted of DUI in Ohio or in another Compact state. The court concluded that &sect; 4507.169 was unconstitutional as applied to the driver in this case because it could not be interpreted so as to allow him to petition for occupational driving privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court. If the driver had yet to serve or was currently serving an administrative license suspension, the trial court was instructed to permanently vacate the suspension.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Greene County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of receiving stolen property in violation of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2913.51(A), sentenced him to 18 months imprisonment, and ordered him to pay a $ 1,000 fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that his defense counsel violated &quot;multiple essential duties&quot; owed to him. As such, defendant contended that he was highly prejudiced by the inadequate representation. In light of the theory set forth by the prosecution at trial, the court found that it was not unreasonable for defendant's counsel to have addressed the issue of theft during the trial. Upon the facts, any motion to suppress would have been without merit. Similarly, a motion in limine would also have been meritless because the prosecution was entitled to explain the circumstances surrounding the inventory search of the vehicle after defendant's arrest. The court could not say that the punishment actually imposed in the case of 18 months imprisonment and a $ 1,000 fine was so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community. Having found valid reason for the greater sentence, and in light of the strong presumption of constitutionality of legislative enactments, the court was not prepared to say that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2929.11(D)(2) was unconstitutional as violative of the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting and sentencing defendant for receiving stolen property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A local option law was passed, which restricted the bar owners' liquor permits so that they could only sell wine. The bar owners sought relief from the trial court to enjoin the department from cancelling or restricting their liquor permits and alternatively, for a writ of mandamus to order the department to compensate them for a taking of their property. The trial court granted a temporary injunction but after a hearing, denied the bar owners' motion for a preliminary injunction and held that the local option law did not deny the bar owners' rights to due process or equal protection, thus they were not entitled to injunctive relief. The bar owners appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that the local option law, which restricted the use of the bar owners' liquor permits to the sale of wine, thus lessening the value of the bar owner's property to the bar owners, did not constitute a taking for which compensation was warranted because a liquor license was not a property right. The court concluded that there was no equal protection violation because the local option law affected all of the liquor permit holders in the state in the same manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Akron Municipal Court of the County of Summit, Ohio, which convicted him of driving under the influence, driving with a prohibited blood alcohol content, and driving under suspension in violation of Akron, Ohio, City Code &sect;&sect; 73.01(A)(1), (3), 71.07(C), respectively. Defendant's motions to dismiss, to suppress, and to declare a statute unconstitutional had been denied by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attacked the constitutionality of the penalty provisions of Akron's laws with respect to prohibited blood alcohol content (OMVI) and the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.91, which permitted the administrative license suspension (ALS) of his driving privileges. He also claimed there no probable cause to arrest him. The court overruled both assignments of error. The court held that defendant was not deprived of his property interest in his driver's license without due process of law by the ALS because the state had a substantial interest in promoting public safety by removing impaired drivers from the highways. Further, the prompt action in impounding his car was justified by the same state interest. The Equal Protection Clause was not violated by the mandatory jail sentence for those convicted of OMVI, the seizure of his car, or the ALS because the state had a legitimate interest in deterring impaired driving. There was no violation of the Eighth Amendment nor were the Akron laws ex post facto. Finally, under the totality of circumstances, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.411(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer obligated itself to indemnify the self-insured employers for losses sustained by the employers because of liability imposed upon the employers by the Workers' Compensation Act of Ohio (the Act) on account of personal injuries and occupational diseases sustained by employees. The trial court held that DWRF payments, made by the bureau, but reimbursed by the employers, fell within the language of the agreements. On appeal, the court held that 1) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.411(C) clearly imposed liability on the employers and was part of the Act; 2) the payments were for injuries or occupational diseases; 3) the employers suffered losses by the payments; and, 4) the payments were &quot;benefits&quot; within the policy language and not assessments. The court construed any ambiguous terms in favor of the insureds and against the drafter and held the insurer could have drafted the agreements to limit its liability. The court further held that the seemingly &quot;retroactive&quot; effect of statutory amendments did not violate either U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or Ohio Const. art. 2, &sect; 28 because the change did not impair contracts and was remedial rather than substantive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital filed a motion for garnishment to collect on the patient's unpaid bill under the general garnishment statute,&nbsp;&sect; 2716.05, that allowed up to 25 percent of the wages, rather than the medical bill garnishment statutes,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2716.021, 2716.051, that only allowed up to 12 percent of the wages. The hospital asserted that the restriction on medical bill garnishment violated equal protection. The municipal court denied the motion. The hospital appealed. The court affirmed. Because the hospital was not a member of a suspect class and a garnishment was not a fundamental right, the medical garnishment classification was subject only to the rational basis level of review. The court found that the stated purpose of the classification was to ensure the provision of health care to Ohio citizens, which was a legitimate governmental interest. Because the limitation under &sect;&sect; 2716.021, 2716.051encouraged citizens to seek out health care by easing the financial burden, there was a rational relationship between the classification and the legitimate government interest.

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1), (4). Defendants sought review, claiming that their convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because they had already been subjected to administrative license suspensions. On appeal, the court consolidated the cases for review. The court determined that to sustain their double jeopardy claims, defendants had the burden of showing that the licensing suspension and subsequent charges were imposed for the same offense and in separate proceedings, and that they were both constitutionally cognizable punishment. The court found that the license proceedings were non-punitive and served the goal of public protection. The court, noting that many jurisdictions had rejected such claims, held that the administrative proceeding was not a constitutionally cognizable punishment for double jeopardy purposes and that there was no double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fatally stabbed one victim in the neck and stabbed the second victim in the chest and shoulder. The surviving victim gave a sworn statement at defendant's former attorney's office, without the presence of the State's attorney. In that statement, the victim stated that the other victim's stab wound resulted during a struggle over the knife. However, at trial, he testified that the stab wound occurred well before any struggle over the knife ensued. Defendant argued that the trial court's instruction to the jury that they were only allowed to consider the victim's prior statement as it related to the victim's credibility, not as evidence of defendant's guilty, deprived him of his right to confrontation. The court found that the victim's statement was inadmissible hearsay and the trial court properly instructed the jury that it could only consider the statement for the limited purpose of determining the victim's credibility. The court further found that the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Deceased was killed while working for employer. Plaintiffs, the executor of the estate and the his survivors, filed a complaint against defendant, the employer's insurer, seeking a declaration of the insurer's liability, and alleging breach of contract and bad faith. The insurer challenged the decision of the trial court, Ohio, which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs and denied the insurer's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer stipulated that that it required the deceased to work under dangerous conditions that were substantially certain to lead to harm. The insurer argued that the employer's acts constituted intentional torts and that commercial general liability policy (CGL) and the employer's liability coverage endorsement policy (ELE) excluded coverage of the employer's intentional torts. After first determining that insuring an employer for its &quot;substantially certain&quot; intentional torts did not violate public policy, the court rejected the insurer's argument. The court found that the ELE did not specifically exclude coverage of intentional torts nor did the ELE specifically state that it incorporated the exclusion in the CGL. Using the relevant rules of construction, the court held that the insurer was required to cover the employer's intentional torts. The court also concluded that even if CGL's exclusion did apply to the ELE, the exclusion only applied to incidents where the insured intended the injury. The court held the decision denying the insurer summary judgment on the claim of bad faith was not appealable because it was not a final order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision granting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and declaring that the insurance policy covered the employer's intentional torts. The court did not rule on the insurer's appeal of the decision denying it summary judgment on the issue of bad faith because the court concluded that the order was not final.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found in favor of the city, and the corporation appealed the judgment. The corporation first argued that the trial court erred when it overruled a motion to dismiss the citations. The court noted that the corporation failed to prove its allegations, therefore, the motion to dismiss was properly overruled. The corporation next argued that the city fraudulently identified the applicable ordinances as criminal statutes that provided for criminal sanctions. The court held that according to the plain language of the applicable ordinances, violation was considered a minor misdemeanor. This was accurately reflected in all documents submitted to the trial court by the city. This assignment of error was overruled. The corporation's remaining allegations were found equally without merit, except for their argument that the fine imposed was excessive. The court agreed that each violation did not amount to an accrual of a separate fine. Therefore, the sum total of the fine was modified, and the judgment as modified was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company applied to defendant city zoning board of appeals (zoning board) for a use permit to expand and remodel its service station and convenience store. The zoning board, in granting the permit to the company, attached some conditions to use of the service station and convenience store. The Montgomery County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) affirmed the zoning board's decision and the company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of its conditions for approval of the proposed use, the zoning board extended normal business hours of the convenience store to 11:00 p.m., allowed tobacco products and petroleum products to be sold after 11:00 p.m., and required that restrooms should be available to the public during business hours from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. The company argued that: (1) the zoning board exceeded its authority by placing the conditions; (2) the trial court erred in affirming the zoning board's ruling that tobacco products could be sold on a 24 hour basis but that convenience products could not; and (3) the trial court erred in refusing to permit the company to present additional evidence as mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03. The court held that (1) the zoning board was only authorized under &sect; 150.458 of the zoning ordinance to place conditions upon the conditional use of the premises and not on the permitted use and (2) there was ample evidence supporting the findings of the zoning board and it was unlikely that additional evidence would have swayed the trial court to overrule the zoning board.</SPAN></P>

He refiled the same action exactly one year later, and appellee sought summary judgment, claiming that the savings statute did not apply to the third complaint. Appellant sought an extension of time to oppose the motion and a protective order, but appellee's motion was granted on the grounds urged. On review, the court found that the first dismissal was a failure of the case otherwise than on the merits, and that the second complaint met the savings statute requirements as filed within one year of that dismissal. The court found that the second dismissal was a similar failure, but that the savings statute could only be used once. The court found that constitutional issues not raised in the trial court were waived, and that the failure to rule on a motion for time not filed under the summary judgment rule or supported by affidavits was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested in Kentucky for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). The driver pleaded guilty and completed the sentence imposed, which included a payment of a fine, completion of a driver's education course, and suspension of his driving privileges. Then, the driver received a notice that the Bureau had suspended his license for six months pursuant to &sect; 4507.169(B), which suspended a driver's license when the driver was convicted of DUI in another state. The driver filed an action seeking to declare &sect; 4507.169(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The driver asserted that he could not petition for occupational driving privileges under &sect; 4507.169 because Kentucky was not a member of the Driver's License Compact. The trial court invalidated the suspension of the driver's license, finding that &sect; 4507.169(B) violated the driver's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that appellants failed to point out any rational basis for treating an Ohio resident convicted of DUI in a non-compact state differently from those Ohio residents convicted of DUI in a state that participated in the compact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a car that was stopped for speeding. After stopping the car, a police officer determined that the driver was under the influence of alcohol. The officer also smelled burnt marijuana. A pat-down search of defendant and an inventory search of the car revealed a small amount of marijuana. As a result, defendant was charged with a minor misdemeanor violation of &sect; 2925.11 for drug abuse. Defendant was convicted. Defendant filed a motion asking the trial court to refrain from imposing the mandatory license suspension in &sect; 2925.11(F). The trial court granted the motion, finding that &sect; 2925.11(F) was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest and that the punishment was grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense. The State appealed. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 2925.11(F) was constitutional even as applied to minor misdemeanor violations. The court explained that defendant was convicted of drug abuse for the possession of an illegal substance. The temporary loss of driving privileges was not so disproportionate to the offense under the Eighth Amendment and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9 as to shock the community's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with resisting arrest. The City made its opening statement, and then defendant sought to dismiss the charges against him on the basis that the City failed to include a culpable mental state in its opening statement. The trial court found defendant not guilty, and the City appealed. The court held that the trial court erred to the prejudice of the City when it dismissed the complaint at the close of the City's opening statement. Because a jury was seated, jeopardy had attached. However, defendant's right against double jeopardy was not violated. The trial court's ruling did not constitute a termination upon a factual finding of insufficient evidence. On the contrary, the trial court erroneously concluded that a statutory offense required the proof of an element which, in fact, appeared as one option under the statute. No evidence was presented at the time in which the trial court granted defendant's motion. Such a conclusion failed to bar a retrial on grounds of double jeopardy, and the city had a right to appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.67(A).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission had conducted an open civil service examination for a technician position for the school district.

In vacating the judgment, the court held that the dictates of Ohio Rev.

The Department denied the application on the basis of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 101-2-47-341, which placed date restrictions on assistance benefits.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed the Department's decision, and appellants sought review, contending that the date restriction on adoption assistance benefits violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. In affirming, the court held that the challenged date restriction was rationally related to the state's interest in conserving public funds, which did not become available to Ohio until the implementation of Pub. L. No. 96-272 in 1980. The date restriction was also rationally related to the state's interest in encouraging future adoptions of &quot;special needs&quot; children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father asked the trial court to determine when child support should have been terminated. The trial court's order required him to continue to pay support until she completed high school, although she had already reached the age of majority and moved out of her mother's house. The court affirmed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.05(E), on which the trial court relied, was not retroactive as applied to the father, although it was enacted after the original support order, because the statute was remedial, not substantive. It provided a remedy for enforcement of the father's duty to support his minor child by extending the jurisdiction of the court to order the relief the age of majority. It imposed no new duty and it impaired no right. The determination that the child was emancipated when she graduated was irrelevant to the father's support duty because she was no longer a minor, and emancipation could only have relieved the father of his duty to support a minor child. The trial court's refusal to find that she was emancipated one year earlier was not a abuse of discretion because it was in her best interest to continue high school for another year to prepare for a cosmetology career.</SPAN></P>

Upon the denial of the application, the builder challenged the validity of Sharon Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution art. X, &sect; 1000-3A.4., which provided that no building was to be erected within 200 feet from any oil or gas well head.The court affirmed the denial of the variance, holding that the zoning regulation did not conflict with the statutory plan embodied in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 1509 and, accordingly, was not preempted by statute. Although the trial court was not required to investigate the motives of the township in enacting the regulation, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that the resolution was enacted for health and safety purposes. Because no house existed on the property before the enactment of the regulation, the builder was not deprived of any vested property rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the owner leased a portion of his property for the storage of equipment, the city sent the owner notice of a zoning violation for maintaining a business in a residential area. Thereafter, the owner was granted a conditional use permit, which was later rescinded, and was also denied a variance following a hearing. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment affirming the board's decisions. Specifically, the court determined that the decision to deny the variance was supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and that the ordinance at issue, Lafayette Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 5, did not unconstitutionally deprive the owner of his property. In support of its conclusions, the court noted that there was no provision in the ordinance permitting residentially zoned property to have been used for commercial purposes by non-residents and that the owner had not been denied the reasonable use of his property since he was still able to obtain rental income from a leased residence. Thus, the owner failed to establish that the property had no value as a residential property and failed to prove that a taking had occurred.</SPAN></P>

In the course of his employment, decedent was instructed to repair a Freon leak. Thereafter, decedent experienced symptoms consistent with exposure to phosgene gas. Decedent knew that he had been exposed to phosgene gas, but he did not recognize the seriousness of such exposure. Subsequently, decedent died at his home. Decedent's wife, and executrix of his estate, filed an intentional tort action against appellee. The trial court found that decedent's wife had not created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellee knew that the decedent's death was substantially certain to result from the conditions of his employment. The court stated that decedent's evidence of inadequate safety procedures and OSHA violations did not show that the injury was a substantially certain to occur. Therefore, appellee could not reasonably be imputed with knowledge, to a substantial certainty, that decedent was performing repairs in an unsafe manner. Decedent was apparently aware that phosgene gas was a dangerous byproduct of Freon but he did not protect himself from that danger by purging the refrigerant line before brazing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a regulated company, sought review of a decision in favor of appellee, Ohio State Board of Pharmacy, by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) in an action to require the Board to retract its statement that the company's medication dispensing equipment was not in compliance with Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4729-9-04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the Board's licensees inquired whether unused medication dispensed by the company's equipment could have been re-dispensed to other patients. When the Board replied by letter in the negative, the company demanded that the Board retract its decision. The Board replied by letter that the machinery did not meet the requirements of &sect; 4729-9-04. The court held that the Board acted properly. The Board did not exceed its authority when it stated by letter that the machinery did not meet the requirements of &sect; 4729-9-04 because that was part of its authority to regulate the practice of pharmacy. The court reasoned that without the responses, the licensee could have illegally returned the unused medication. The Board properly defined &quot;unopened&quot; in &sect; 4729-9-04 because its decision was an interpretation and not an expansion of the term without a rule-making proceeding. The definition did not require a prior determination that the product was tamper-evident. There was no violation of the Commerce Clause because the regulation applied to all companies doing business in Ohio and, thus, its decision did not discriminate against the company in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction for drug trafficking, the State filed a motion for forfeiture of defendant's ownership interest in his home on the ground that he had used his home to facilitate drug transactions. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant argued that the trial court's finding that the used his home for drug transactions was contrary to law and that the forfeiture constituted an excessive find under the U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court held that the trial court correctly found that defendant used his home to facilitate drug transaction because his actions clearly fell within the definitions of &quot;use&quot; and &quot;facilitate&quot; as provided by Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2925.42(A)(1)(b). The court reasoned that as a situs for the sales, the property &quot;facilitated&quot; them by permitting them to be conducted in atmosphere of relative privacy. Applying the proportionality test, the court held that the trial court did not err when it determined that the forfeiture did not constitute an excessive fine. The court considered defendant's culpability, the relation of the property to the crime, and the harshness of the forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's neighbors complained of hearing a loud bang and discovered a bullet lodged in a wall of their apartment. Defendant later admitted to firing a gun accidentally and was indicted for improperly discharging a firearm at or into a habitation, and having a weapon while under a disability along with the specification of having a firearm. He was convicted of the latter offense and sentenced accordingly along with the firearms specification. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the specifications of a prior conviction for a violent offense. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence, holding that imposition of his indefinite sentence did not result in additional or cumulative punishment because the State and trial court complied with the procedural requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2929.11and 2941.143. The court concluded that the terms of Ohio Rev.

The ordinance required that all manufactured homes be located within manufactured home parks. The ordinance also provided that any lawfully existing manufactured home on an individual lot could not be replaced with another manufactured home. The trial court dismissed the village's action because it found that the ordinance conflicted with the general law of Ohio, specifically Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 713.15. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the ordinance conflicted with &sect; 713.15 because it did not provide for the substitution of the nonconforming use. Section 713.15 provided that a use that existed and was lawful prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance, and which was made nonconforming by the ordinance, had to be allowed to continue. Accordingly, the court held that under Ohio Const. art.18, &sect; 3, the ordinance was invalid because it conflicted with the general laws of the state.</SPAN></P>

In response to a petition signed by the residents of the area, the district was organized. The court determined that the district was properly formed and operating pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court determined that the clear language of the statute contemplated the possibility that some parcels of property within the district would receive more or less benefits than others, and that those parcels should have been assessed a greater or smaller proportion of the costs. The court determined that not only was there a total failure on the part of the Board of Appraisers to fulfill its obligations, but the trial court allowed the imposition of the costs of implementing the official plan without any appraisal or notice to the property owners. The court found that the trial court erred in interpreting the statute to require only consideration of the benefits to property. The court concluded that the complete neglect of the appraisal process and the arbitrary uniform-rate allocation of the costs of operating the district could not have been considered harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Ohio appealed from a judgment of a trial court (Ohio), which granted defendant's motion to suppress because the police had violated the knock and announce requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.12 resulting in an unconstitutional search by warrant of defendant's home. Defendant had been indicted for drug abuse and trafficking in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.11, 2925.03(A)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three marked police vehicles pulled into defendant's driveway. Two were clearly marked. About 10 police officers shouted many times &quot;deputy sheriff, search warrant.&quot; The officers were also wearing clearly marked uniforms and accessories. While continually shouting, one deputy sheriff pounded on the casement of an outer storm door. Hearing no response from the occupants, the deputy found the door locked and pried it open. After the deputy pounded on the main wooden entry door while shouting his notice, he used a &quot;battering ram&quot; to open the door. The deputy acted upon a constructive refusal to admit. The State contended that the trial court erred to the substantial prejudice of the State by granting defendant's motion to suppress evidence. Upon review of the trial court record, the court held that sheriff's department under the facts and circumstances of the case did precisely what was required to be done as a pre-condition to entry as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.12. Accordingly, the State's assignment of error was well taken, and the judgment of the trial court granting defendant's motion to suppress was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 451.19(A)(3) for operating a vehicle with a concentration of .10 of one gram or more per weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his breath. At the time of defendant's arrest, his driver's license was placed under an administrative license suspension pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 411.191. Defendant contended that his criminal conviction after his license suspension violated his rights against double jeopardy and argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the criminal charge. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for the trial court to enter judgment of dismissal for defendant as to the criminal conviction. The court found that the sanctions imposed pursuant to both statutes were for the same offense, were imposed in separate proceedings, and constituted punishment. Thus, the subsequent criminal hearing subjected defendant to double jeopardy. Upon remand, the court ruled that the trial court could reimpose the balance of defendant's administrative license suspension, pursuant to his status as a first-time offender who submitted to, but failed, a breathalyzer test.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the record contained sufficient evidence for the trial court to, within its discretion, find beyond a reasonable doubt that the owner was in contempt of its prior order and that the owner, when given the opportunity, failed to purge himself of that contempt. The court also found that the $ 1 million bond ordered by the trial court was intended to secure the owner's future compliance with its order and was not in the nature of an excessive fine or a forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by an Ohio municipal court of driving while under the influence of alcohol, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19(A)(1). The trial court sentenced defendant to 15 days in jail with 12 days suspended, a fine of $ 200 plus court costs, and suspended his driver's license for one year with occupational driving privileges and credit for the pre-trial suspension period. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a written plea of not guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss that driving charge on the grounds that portions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4511.19, 4511.99, and 4511.191 were unconstitutional due to the mandated sentencing, denial of equal protection, excessive penalties, ex post facto legislation, violation of &quot;home rule,&quot; denial of due process, the primacy of court rules, and violation of the separation of powers. A second motion to dismiss was filed in which defendant claimed that the subsequent prosecution for the underlying driving offense following the administrative license suspension (ALS) was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clauses of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Because there had been no appeal from the trial court's denial of defendant's ALS appeal, which was a final, appealable order, the court had no jurisdiction to consider the ALS issues raised by defendant. Also, a mandatory, three-day jail sentence for a first violation was not so disproportionate to his driving offense as to violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court affirmed the county board's decision to deny a petition for annexation of acreage in a township park to a city. On appeal and cross-appeal, the court found that the proposed annexation was not significantly adjacent to the city. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.02 provided that the owners of real estate adjacent to a municipal corporation could, at their option, cause such territory to be annexed thereto, in the manner provided by &sect;&sect; 709.03 to 709.11. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.02 clearly required that any land that was annexed to a city had to be adjacent to that city. In the case at bar, the land was not sufficiently adjacent to the city so as to comply with the concept of a municipality as a unified body. Further, the court found that the county board's decision was not unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. Although the trial court erred in deciding that the county board could consider a resolution from the city, adopted after the date of the public hearing on the proposed annexation, the court held that no reversible error was committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant creditor challenged the judgment of the Wayne County Municipal Court (Ohio), which denied its motion to vacate an earlier order that the trial court would not have permitted a garnishment of an amount greater than 12 percent of appellee debtor's wages when the creditor was a health care provider attempting to collect a debt incurred for providing health care services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor, a hospital, sought to collect against the debtor for unpaid medical services. The trial court had ruled that the creditor was limited to garnishing 12 percent of the debtor's wages, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court affirmed the judgment and held that &sect;&sect; 2716.021, 2616.051 survived constitutional challenge under the rational basis scrutiny. The statutes rationally related to the state's interest in protecting the health of its citizens by easing their financial burdens and encouraging them to seek out medical treatment. By limiting the amount of garnishment a health care creditor could have collected, the statute protected those with limited resources by avoiding the sometimes pernicious consequences of attempting to collect an inordinate sum from those who were seriously ill, by encouraging people with limited resources to seek out medical care, and by protecting those persons who faced only two options, treatment or death, because of their illness. The court noted that the statutes did not relieve the debtor of his obligation to pay.</SPAN></P>

First the court determined that the evidence supported the finding of the aggravated circumstances of which defendant was found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, the court independently weighed all the evidence disclosed in the record and determined that the aggravating circumstances of attempted rape outweighed the mitigating factors that defendant proved during the penalty phase of the trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant policemen sought review of an order of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied their motion for summary judgment based on the defense of qualified immunity in appellee arrestees' action brought for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and for state tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestees were all African-American citizens, stopped by the policemen for minor traffic violations and then apprehended for failure to possess a driver's license. The arrestees claimed that the policemen conducted warrantless searches of their persons and vehicles, and only upon completion, checked to determine if the arrestees were licensed drivers. The arrestees alleged that the policemen were government officials acting under color of law that deprived them of federally protected constitutional rights and that intentionally inflicted emotional distress against them. The trial court denied the policemen qualified immunity because it found a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether police officers of reasonable competence could have disagreed that the apprehensions were unlawful. The court held that although the trial court applied the wrong standard in determining whether the affirmative defense of qualified immunity was available, it did not err in denying summary judgment. The court found that the arrestees' &sect; 1983 claims sought only declaratory and injunctive relief, and that such claims were not barred by qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that denied the policemen summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that petitioner's claims of error made by courts superior to the trial court were not cognizable in postconviction proceedings under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2953.21.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed the judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which adjudicated defendant a delinquent and committed him to the custody of the Department of Youth Services after defendant had entered an admission to a charge of possession of a counterfeit controlled substance, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.37(A), in exchange for a dismissal of a resisting-arrest charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in entering an adjudication of delinquency on the basis of an unconstitutional statute. He argued that &sect; 2825.37(A), combined with the definition of &quot;counterfeit controlled substance&quot; in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.01(P)(4), was vague and overbroad. Section 2925.01(P)(4) defined a counterfeit controlled substance as any substance other than a controlled substance that a reasonable person would believe to be a controlled substance because of its similarity in shape, size, and color, or its markings, labeling, packaging, distribution, or the price for which it is sold or offered for sale. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant had not raised the constitutional issue in the trial court and thus the waiver rule applied. The court concluded that the issue of whether an intermediate court of appeals had discretion in a criminal case to have heard a constitutional issue that was not raised below remained unresolved. The court urged counsel wishing appellate review of constitutional issues to ensure that they were raised at the trial level in the first instances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian filed a complaint on behalf of her child for birth abnormalities. The doctors and the medical center filed a motion to join the ODHS as an intervening plaintiff. The ODHS filed a complaint in intervention asserting a right of subrogation pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5101.58 to recover the $ 64,312 it expended for the child's care. The guardian filed a motion to dismiss the intervention complaint and cross-claim, which the trial court granted. The guardian dismissed the claims against certain doctors. The case proceeded to trial before a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the guardian and the child as to liability. The parties subsequently reached a settlement as to the damages, and the case was dismissed. Reversing and remanding, the court held that the last sentence of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.27 allowed subrogation of the medical claim because it was expressly provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5101.58. The court observed that the record contained no evidence verifying the claim that the guardian and child were barred from recovery for past medical expenses by the statute of limitations, or that the ODHS was similarly barred as a subrogee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed suit against appellees, seeking either a judgment that &sect; 4731.15 did not eliminate mechanotherapy as a limited branch of medicine or a declaration that the elimination of mechanotherapy as a limited branch of medicine was unconstitutional. A referee recommended judgment for appellees. The trial court adopted the referee's report. The court concluded that &sect; 4731.15 did not violate any appellant's due process rights. The legislature did not outlaw mechanotherapy; it merely increased the minimum qualifications for practitioners to those required for chiropractors, as was within its police power. No prospective practitioner or patient was deprived of any right cognizable under the Due Process Clause. The grandfather provision, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4731.151(B)(2), did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Unless fundamental rights or suspect classifications were implicated, a classification needed only to be rationally related to achieving a legitimate state purpose to survive equal protection scrutiny. Section 4731.151(B)(2) did not violate the Equal protection Clause because it was not irrational to conclude that practical experience enhanced competence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motions, defendant pled no contest to the DUI charges, and the court affirmed on appeal. The court found that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress because the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop defendant based on the way he was driving. The license suspension procedures in &sect; 4511.191 did not violate due process because they advanced the State's interest in removing drunk drivers from the roads. The &sect; 4511.191 provision that an appeal of an ALS did not stay the ALS did not violate the principle of separation of powers. Defendant was not prejudiced by the no stay provisions. Further, &sect; 4511.191 did not violate defendant's equal protection rights because any distinction between those who refused a test and those who took and failed the test and pled no contest to DUI was rationally related to the State's interest of encouraging licensees to consent to testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil company filed two applications for the permit, both of which were denied, and then filed administrative appeals; the bowling alley filed an administrative appeal. The lower court remanded the cause to the Commission for entry of conclusions of fact instead of taking additional evidence. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal because the trial court's judgment was not a final order. Upon receipt of the Commission's findings, the lower court reversed the Commission's decision, ruling that the decision was not supported by the evidence and ordered the Commission to issue the permits; the lower court dismissed the bowling alley's appeal for lack of standing. The court concluded that the lower court erred in its ruling that the performance of its duties under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03(A)(5) would violate the doctrine of separation of powers. The lower court's remand of the case to the Commission was without statutory authority. The lower court's action was not harmless error because the Commission was prepared to produce testimony of various officials that the proposed use would conflict with the criteria set forth in Mentor, Ohio, Code of Ordinances &sect; 150.704.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an insurance coverage dispute related to plaintiff employee's intentional tort claim against her employer, the employee appealed a decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted summary judgment to defendant insurer and denied it to the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a robbery, the employee sustained a shotgun blast at point blank range, resulting in severe injuries to her face. The employee sought damages from the employer on, inter alia, an intentional tort theory. The insurer refused to defend or indemnify the employer on the basis of a lack of coverage, and the employer confessed judgment in the employee's favor. The employee then sought a declaratory judgment that the insurer had a duty to defend and indemnify the employer. The trial court granted summary judgment to the insurer and denied it to the employee. On appeal the court held that 1) an endorsement to the insurance policy extended coverage to the employee's intentional tort claim to the extent that it exceeded the employer's liability under the workers' compensation law, 2) public policy did not preclude an employer from insuring itself against liability for &quot;substantially certain&quot; intentional torts against employees, and 3) the employer's umbrella policy, which was also issued by the insurer, did not cover claims for injuries expected or intended from the standpoint of the employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment with respect to the employer's general liability policy, but affirmed it with respect to the employer's umbrella policy, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Ohio Department of Liquor Control sought review of a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted appellee social club's motion to suppress evidence seized in a warrant less search and to dismiss a petition for forfeiture. The State claimed that the trial court erred in considering the constitutionality of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-79 and by finding &sect; 4301:1-1-79 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The social club held a liquor permit issued by the State. State liquor agents conducted a warrantless search of the club pursuant to Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-79 to investigate a complaint of gambling. The state liquor agents seized gambling paraphernalia and cited the social club for possession of the paraphernalia under Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53. The State filed a petition for forfeiture under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.43. The social club filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search and to dismiss the forfeiture petition. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the petition finding Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-79&nbsp;unconstitutional. The State appealed, claiming the trial court erred in considering the constitutionality of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-79 and by finding it unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed without addressing the constitutional argument. The court found that in a prior decision it had determined that gambling paraphernalia seized by liquor agents in a warrantless search must be excluded at a forfeiture proceeding, and therefore there was no reason for the court, or the trial court, to reach the constitutionality issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first trial, resulted in a mistrial due to prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant contended that a second trial was barred by double jeopardy. Defendant claimed that he did not point the gun at the victim, but unintentionally pulled the trigger while the victim was standing in front of him. Witnesses indicated that defendant waved the gun around just prior to the shooting and boasted that he could shoot someone and get away with it. Defendant admitted at trial that he killed the victim. The only element of the crime upon which conflicting evidence was presented was defendant's mental state at the time of the killing. Sufficient evidence existed to support the trial court's decision to instruct the jury on the offense of involuntary manslaughter with the underlying offenses of felonious assault and assault. The gun specification applied to the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, and imposition of this sentence was not a violation of double jeopardy. Evidence that defendant purposely shot the victim with prior calculation and design was sufficient to create a jury question. Negligent homicide was not a lesser-included offense of aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>

Defendant stated that he only meant to shoot the victim in the shoulder. On appeal, defendant's argument focused mainly on his inability to make a voluntary statement due to his diminished capacity brought on by two days of heavy drug and alcohol abuse, lack of nourishment, fatigue, and lack of intellect. The court affirmed the convictions. In doing so, the court held that (1) the detectives' failure to conduct a mental examination and failure to record defendant's statement did not constitute coercion to render the confession involuntary, (2) defendant's gaze was not unsteady, he had no trouble walking, he had no trouble following directions to sit down, in reading or in talking, and there was no indication that defendant was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, (3) the record established that defendant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to trial by jury because he signed a written waiver, and (4) because defendant's other siblings had grown up as law-abiding citizens, the mitigating nature of a disruptive or chaotic childhood was reduced for purposes of sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sought to assert its reversionary interest and quiet title in a tract of land on the basis that the land was not being used for school purposes. The board of trustees filed a counterclaim asserting that the corporation breached its agreement by retaining a reversionary interest. The trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The court affirmed. The counterclaim was bifurcated and had not proceeded to trial. Thus, the trial court's decision denying the corporation's motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim was not a final, appealable order. Based on the trial court's language and analysis concerning the abandonment issue and complete lack of reference to laches, the court found that reference to the timing of the action was merely dictum. Thus, the court held that the corporation could not appeal from that statement. Witnesses established that the property was being maintained in anticipation for a future school building. No other tract was suitable as a future school site. The court found that the trial court's finding that the school board intended to place a building on the property was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner challenged an order from the Ross County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granting summary judgment to appellees, a city, a compliance officer, and an engineer, on two counts and dismissing a third count for lack of jurisdiction. Counts one and two sought damages for an alleged wrongful demolition of a building. Count three sought a declaratory judgment ruling that Chillicothe, Ohio, City Code &sect; 1705.04, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's building was uninhabitable due to fire damage. The officer mailed a notice to the owner and also posted a copy of the notice on the property, indicating that the city would demolish or repair the building unless the owner repaired or demolished the building within 30 days. The notice also informed the owner of her rights to appeal, which she never exercised. After inspecting the building and finding no repairs, the officer had the building demolished. On appeal, the owner argued that the trial court committed prejudicial error in dismissing the complaint, in finding demolition of the building was a governmental function, in finding that the claim for wrongful demolition did not state a constitutional claim, and in finding no bad faith. The court held that: (1) pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12, the trial court properly dismissed the action because the owner failed to serve the Ohio Attorney General with notice of the declaratory judgment proceedings; (2) this defect, which was jurisdictional, precluded the trial court's review; and (3) pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(F), the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the owner's motion for a continuance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that there were reasonable grounds for the appeal, affirmed the judgment from the trial court, and ordered that appellees recover costs of the owner. The court also ordered that a special mandate issue out of the court directing the trial court to carry the judgment into execution, and terminated any stay previously granted by the court as of the date of the entry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landlord filed a complaint seeking forcible entry and detainer, monetary damages, and equitable relief against the tenant on the ground that the tenant was operating an adult entertainment facility on the leased premises in violation of the Washington Township zoning ordinance and in violation of their lease. The court ruled that the order staying the writ of restitution was the functional equivalent of a reconsideration and repudiation of the trial judge's statement about non-appealability and that that error was harmless. The court further held that because the tenant agreed to be bound by local zoning ordinances, without regard to their constitutionality, its only defense to the forcible entry and detainer action based would have been to demonstrate that the entertainment did not fall within the ordinance's definition of adult entertainment. The court found that the tenant did not present any evidence to that effect and that the trial court's decision not to allow the tenant to present a defense based upon the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance did not violate the tenant's statutory or constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The police officer smelled alcohol and performed field sobriety tests on defendant. Defendant passed the tests and the police officer told him that he was free to go. Thereafter, the police officer asked defendant for consent to search the van, which defendant provided, and the contraband was found. Defendant was convicted after he pleaded no contest. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of the search of his vehicle and the trial court erred in imposing three 180-day operator's license suspensions. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and license suspensions. The police officer did not seize or stop defendant when he approached defendant's van and questioned him. The court concluded that the police officer was free to attempt to engage in consensual interrogation with defendant after the police officer told defendant that he was free to go.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Licking County (Ohio), which denied the employer's motion to intervene in appellee employee's negligence action against appellee lumber company arising out of the employee's on-the-job injuries that were incurred when the employee tripped and fell while attempting to get out of the way of a towmotor driven by a lumber company employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employee successfully filed a workers' compensation claim against the employer for his injuries, the employee commenced a negligence action against the lumber company. The employer moved to intervene in the proceedings under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.93(D). The trial court denied the employer's motion to intervene, finding that &sect; 4123.93, which did not become effective until after the accident, did not apply retroactively. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 4123.93 could not be applied retroactively because the statute did not expressly state that it retrospectively applied to actions, causes of action, or pending litigation and the word &quot;claim&quot; in H.B. 107, &sect; 7 (Ohio 1993) was restricted to those matters pending with the Bureau of Workers' Compensation; (2) &sect; 4123.93 was inapplicable because the employer was not a member of any group intended to have subrogation rights under the statute; and (3) &sect; 4123.93 was also inapplicable because the statute did not permit an employer to recover the costs incurred as a result of increased workers' compensation premiums. Thus, the court determined that the trial court properly denied the employer's motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the employer's motion to intervene in the negligence action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' complaint sought a declaration of rights under Ohio Rev.

The trial court granted the coroner's motion to dismiss, and the parents sought review. The court affirmed, but the supreme court reversed, holding that the parents stated a justiciable claim for relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.19 and that the coroner's motion to dismiss under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12.6 was improvidently granted. On remand, the trial court dismissed the amended complaint. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court's consideration on remand of the statute's constitutionality did not violate the supreme court's decision that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 313.19 was unconstitutional, and the law of the case doctrine did not compel the denial of the coroner's motion to dismiss the complaint on that basis. The court held that the judicial-review provision of &sect; 313.19 was void for vagueness, the state supreme court had not yet addressed the issue, and the parents had not provided a reason to revisit the question.</SPAN></P>

What the parties termed a &quot;restrictive covenant&quot; requiring that purchasers in the subdivision seek annexation when legally possible was to be included by the developer in any conveyance deeds, but in fact such covenants were not included in subsequent deeds. The trial court found that the agreement constituted neither a common-law covenant running with the land nor an equitable covenant. In reversing the trial court's judgment, the court determined that although the covenant in the agreement was not one running with the land, it was nonetheless enforceable as an equitable servitude or obligation. The court found that the circumstances surrounding the agreement indicated that the developers, as promisor, manifested an intention that its successors in title were to be bound as they had been bound.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's fourth conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol within a five-year period, the trial court ordered that the motorcycle he was driving at the time of the offense be forfeited. Claiming that the value of the motorcycle exceeded the maximum fine that could have been imposed for the offense, defendant argued on appeal that the forfeiture order violated the Excessive Fines Clauses of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. The court affirmed the order. The court held that in actions involving in personam forfeitures, courts were required to apply a &quot;proportionality&quot; test, comparing the amount of forfeiture with the gravity of the offense, in which property value was only one factor. Deciding that issue as a question of law under a de novo standard of review, the court held that defendant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the forfeiture was excessive. Because defendant could have caused a serious accident resulting in property damage, bodily injury, or death, and because the motorcycle was a substantial instrumentality in the offense, the court held that the forfeiture was not so grossly disproportionate as to constitute an excessive fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A principal found two tobacco cigarettes in the student's jacket in his locker. On this appeal, the student argued that the mere possession of the cigarettes was not included in the list of offenses in the student code for which a five-day suspension could be imposed. The school board argued that such suspensions were within its discretion. The court held that &sect; 3313.661 was clear and unambiguous. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3313.661 stated that a school board must adopt a policy that specified the types of misconduct for which a pupil could be suspended, and that no student could be suspended except for violation of one of the specified offenses. The court rejected an argument that the offense was inherently so serious as to justify a suspension under a general provision of the student code. The court emphasized that the case was being decided on statutory grounds, not on an abuse of discretion standard, which would have applied if the offense had been listed. The court held that the school board could not suspend the student because it had not adopted a policy that listed the offense as one that could merit a suspension.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3113.215 that the trial court complete a standard child support worksheet was constitutional, despite the lack of a provision in the worksheet to check whether the support order violated the Act, because whether the amount of support withdrawn from an obligor's paycheck violated the Act was a matter that had to be left to the employer to determine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On October 22, 1993, the judges of a racetrack issued a ruling in which they suspended the horse owner and trainer from racing for 30 days, imposed a $ 100 fine, and ordered him to return any purse money earned on August 28, 1993. On November 3, 1993, the judges issued a ruling in which they assessed a fine of $ 250 and suspended the horse owner and trainer from racing for a period of 60 days. The horse owner and trainer appealed both cases to the Ohio State Racing Commission, contending that the racetrack judges lacked the jurisdiction to issue the rulings. The Commission affirmed the October 22, 1993, ruling, but modified the November 3, 1993, ruling by assessing a $ 500 fine and a 120 day suspension from racing. The trial court reversed the suspension and the fine, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 3769.091 was fatally flawed, depriving the horse owner and trainer of the right to have his actions judged by a statute that was clear, unambiguous, and definitive, and not unconstitutionally vague. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that the trial court reached the right result, albeit for the wrong reason.</SPAN></P>

The board again voted to revoke the doctor's license. The doctor filed a notice of appeal and a motion for stay of revocation with the trial court. The trial court granted the stay, but affirmed the revocation of the doctor's license. The doctor then filed a motion with the board for remand to a hearing examiner so she could present evidence in mitigation of the sanction, which the board denied. The trial court again affirmed the revocation of the doctor's license. In affirming the trial court, the court held that the doctor had no cognizable due process interest in having another opportunity to be heard. The board, the trial court, and the court had already considered the question of doctor's guilt, and the remand to the board was for the sole purpose of reconsidering the sanction. Thus, the board's denial of the doctor's requests to present additional evidence did not violate the doctor's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that Monroe Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution art.

The vehicle was not equated with the term &quot;junk&quot; as that term was defined in the zoning ordinance beyond the mere fact that it was unlicensed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of drug abuse under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred by overruling his Ohio R. Crim.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that a reasonable trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the State presented sufficient evidence to prove that defendant possessed cocaine. The record indicated that police officers found a rock of crack cocaine in defendant's proximity. While mere proximity did not constitute conclusive evidence of possession, it did constitute competent evidence on the issue of possession. Additionally, evidence adduced at trial revealed that defendant made movements toward the floor area of the car both at the time the police arrived and when a police officer asked him to place his hands in her view.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), defendant was convicted of aggravated trafficking, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(2). As part of his sentence, the court of common pleas suspended defendant's driver's license, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(M). Defendant appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated trafficking and drug abuse. When defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated trafficking, the drug abuse charge was dismissed. On appeal, defendant contended that the court of common pleas erred in suspending his driver's license as part of his sentence and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(M) was a violation of his constitutional right to due process because it allowed for the suspension of his driver's license even though he did not use a motor vehicle in the commission of a drug offense or operate a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court examined precedent, finding that many courts had upheld similar driver's license suspensions in cases where defendants were either convicted of trafficking or were drug offenders who did not use motor vehicles in the commission of any offense. The court held that the suspension of defendant's driver's license did not violate his right to due process because &sect; 2925.03(M) was rationally related to the State's legitimate interests in punishing drug offenders, deterring drug abuse, and impeding the distribution of illegal drugs.</SPAN></P>

It was abundantly clear that the guardian received notice of the action, and he could not demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the state's failure to formally join a party that could have been permissibly joined. While probate courts were permitted to exercise their jurisdiction and plenary power to resolve all issues before it when the probate court had asserted jurisdiction, the probate court in appellant's case chose to not exercise any jurisdiction. It was the state's obligation to request that the probate court order the guardian to pay the judgment because granting permission or requiring the guardian to pay such an award was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court. The trial court did not err when it did not dismiss the case for failure to join the administrator of veterans' affairs because such joinder was permissive only. However, the trial court did err when it did not dismiss those portions of the complaint, which were time-barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the pleas court's decision as to the assignments of error relating to the failure to grant appellant's motion to dismiss for lack of capacity to be sued, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, failure to join the veterans administrator, and a due process violation. The court reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with its opinion with respect to the assignment of error regarding the six-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the indictment for possession of criminal tools was void, as it failed to specifically allege the criminal purpose with which he possessed the shotgun. The court reasoned that the indictment tracked the language of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.24, stating that defendant possessed a 16-gauge shotgun, with purpose to use it criminally. The court held that this language was sufficient to charge an offense. Defendant further contended that he should have been sentenced for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, menacing, or aggravated menacing, rather than possession of criminal tools. Defendant contended that the State unconstitutionally elevated the charge to a felony by charging him with violation of a general statute rather than a specific statute. The court rejected this contention, holding that prosecution pursuant to a general statute was inappropriate only when the elements of the offenses corresponded to such a degree that the commission of a specific crime necessarily resulted in commission of the general crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of Ohio, challenged a judgment of the Fairfield Municipal Court (Ohio), which held that the mandatory license suspension provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.11(F), 4507.16(D)(2) violated constitutional principles of due process, equal protection, and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest and was found guilty of drug abuse under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11. Besides a fine and a suspended jail sentence, the trial court suspended defendant's driver's license under &sect;&sect; 2925.11(F), 4507.16(D)(2). The trial court subsequently vacated the license suspension, concluding that &sect;&sect; 2925.11(F), 4507.16(D)(2) violated both the state and federal constitutions. The court reversed. The legislature could have concluded the prospect of losing one's driver's license was necessary to deter a potential drug user from experimenting and committing that first drug offense. Accordingly, it bore a rational relationship to the state's legitimate interest in deterrence, the punishment of drug offenders, and highway safety, and did not violate due process. The punishment imposed was not so greatly disproportionate to the offense as to shock the sense of justice of the community. Therefore, the punishment did not violate due process and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Where individuals were not similarly situated, dissimilar treatment did not violate equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. 3702.53(A)(3). On appeal, the hospital argued that the lower court erred in determining that the certificate of need application was approved by operation of law because it was not in accordance with the law. The court agreed with the hospital. The court pointed out that the lower court's order was not in accordance with the applicable law. The court found that the amended version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3702.53(A)(3) was a remedial statute. Therefore, it applied to the competing hospitals' application for a certificate of need, as no appeal had been taken nor had a hearing been completed when the amended statute became effective and, thus, the project had not been deemed approved as required by law.</SPAN></P>

First, when issues of law in capital cases had been considered and decided, and were raised anew in a subsequent capital case, it was proper to summarily dispose of such issues in the subsequent case. Because defendant's issues of law regarding the death sentence had been considered and overruled, the court held that such assignments of error had no merit. Second, defendant's conscious decisions to remove his girlfriend, strategically position another, and to continue to shoot his victim after he had fallen, proved that he acted with prior calculation and design. Third, the court concluded that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Fourth, the court found that the death sentence was appropriate, proportionate, and not excessive when compared with other cases in which there was a prior conviction for a purposeful killing, within the meaning of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the resident argued that the trial court erred in upholding the village's ordinance as it was based on aesthetic considerations instead of as part of a comprehensive zoning plan; in failing to apply the standard of strict construction applicable to the quasi-criminal statute; in failing to rule that the ordinance was void due to the repeal of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4501.01(1)'s definition of the trailer the resident possessed; and in granting summary judgment to the village. In rejecting each argument raised by the resident, the court held that the village was empowered under Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 to enact the ordinance that was passed for sanitation, health, and safety purposes and that the resident's failure to comply therewith authorized it to seek the injunction. Further, the village could bring either a criminal action for the ordinance violation or a civil one, thus the trial court's strict construction in the civil case was proper. Finally, &sect; 4501.01(1)'s amended term &quot;manufactured home&quot; included &quot;house trailers&quot; and provided fair notice of what the law required.

Defendant's conviction, which was based upon the officer's experienced identification of the marijuana pipe and the marijuana residue located thereon together with defendant's statement, was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor was assigned a credit card debt incurred by the decedent. The creditor's main office was located in Michigan. The decedent died and notification of her death and the allowance of claims was published in accordance with applicable statutes.

The creditor appealed the judgment contending that it met the time requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2117.06(A) in that the creditor filed a timely certificate of judgment. The court noted that &sect; 2117.06 and the subsequent interpretations thereof, that had provided for other than strict compliance with the statutory language, had been based upon the executor having actual notice of the claim in hand through some other means.

Code Ann. &sect; 901.51, and punitive damages. The trial court dismissed appellants' claim for treble damages because appellees had not been convicted of recklessly cutting down trees in violation of &sect; 901.51. The trial court also limited damages to the greater of the commercial value of the cut timber or the diminution in value of the land. The jury found that appellants' land had not been damaged, that punitive damages were not warranted, and that appellants were entitled to the value of the timber. On appeal, the court agreed that treble damages could not be imposed pursuant to &sect; 901.51 where criminal liability had not been established. The court reversed the damages award and remanded for a retrial because appellants were entitled to seek restoration damages which exceeded the diminution in fair market value where the appellants used the property as a weekend retreat and the restoration cost was not grossly disproportionate to the value of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee land developer sought approval from the appellee City of Bexley to build a restaurant. The court held that relevant zoning ordinance was clear and unambiguous and provided that an eating place was a permitted use in the district. The board of zoning appeals granted requests for variances from the zoning code's requirement with respect to an on-site loading place and parking spaces. The trial court held that traffic impact evidence was relevant and that both boards failed to give proper considerations to traffic concerns. The court held that evidence of increased traffic, standing alone, was insufficient to justify the denial of an otherwise permitted use. Next, the court found that substantial evidence supported the board of zoning appeals' determination to grant the area variances. The essential character of the neighborhood would not be altered. Also, the trial court erred in its reversal in part of the environmental review board's approval of the plans and specifications for the restaurant. The court held that the trial court engrafted a traffic volume requirement to the relevant zoning ordinance that was not part of the existing code.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court entered a default judgment against appellant after it denied his motion to dismiss based upon both incorrect venue and lack of jurisdiction.

Appellant sought review and the court declared all proceedings against appellant in the county court a nullity and, pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 12(B), vacated the judgment and dismissed appellee's action. The court concluded that the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1901.19(A)(4) existed as a geographic limitation on the subject-matter jurisdiction of municipal courts and did not relate to venue. Accordingly, the county court did not have jurisdiction of the matter because appellant resided within a municipal court jurisdiction and there was nothing in the record to indicate that the subject matter of the action was located within the territory of the county court. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1907.01 the county court's jurisdiction was superseded by the municipal court district in which appellant resided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board granted the applicants a variance from the side-yard setback requirements of the township zoning resolution by permitting them to build an addition to an existing garage that would be 11 feet from the property line instead of 50 feet. The Board found that because of the irregular shape of the lot the applicants would encounter practical difficulties in finding an alternative location for the larger garage. The owner appealed and the trial court affirmed. The owner sought further review and the court affirmed the decision, finding that the owner failed to meet his burden of proving that the Board improperly granted the variance. The evidence indicated that the walls of the existing garage were already in violation of the side-yard setback and that the addition authorized by the variance allowed an extension of those walls. The trial court considered the factors required in considering the area variance sought by the applicants and properly concluded that the owner failed to establish that the decision of the Board was unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, among other things, claimed that the trial court erred when it failed to quash the indictment due to irregularities in the selection of the grand jury and that the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court affirmed the judgment and sentence. Defendant did not show that he was prejudiced by the grand juror selection process. The evidence tended to prove defendant planned the events, even going to the extent of sketching a diagram of the crime scene, provided the guns, gloves, handcuffs, and duct tape, created the plan to gain entry to the house and subdue each of the four victims. Most importantly, three witnesses testified that defendant, using one victim's revolver, shot each of the four victims. The evidence provided by the State was sufficient to convince the average mind that defendant, acting with prior calculation and design, purposely killed the victims. There was no mitigating evidence in his behalf and the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The death sentence imposed was not disproportionate to the death sentences imposed in other capital cases decided by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee argued that the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the revocation and in finding that the administrative search of the premises was not illegal. The licensee argued that Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-79 was unconstitutional because it was not enacted within the proper time period after a previous statute was found unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that even though the regulation was not enacted within the prescribed time, it was still constitutional because it established time, place, and scope limitations on warrantless administrative searches. Although the trial court orally ruled upon a motion to suppress, there was no requirement that such an order be in writing. The court held that the search was lawful because the Commission relied upon the regulation, and thus it did not have to meet one of the exceptions for a warrantless search. There was enough evidence to show a violation of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-53 because the testimony established the presence and use of gambling devices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was found lying in her backyard dead from a gunshot wound, but the coroner determined that her death was a suicide. The executor of the decedent's estate filed a suit against the coroner, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The trial court entered a judgment for the executor, but on appeal, the coroner challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 313.19. The court rejected the coroner's contentions holding that because the action was brought pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act, the legislature's failure to list who may bring such a suit did not make &sect; 313.19 void for vagueness. The court further held that &sect; 313.19 was not per se unconstitutional simply because it failed to identify when a plaintiff may contest the coroner's ruling. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the executor had presented competent and credible evidence that the decedent had not committed suicide.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4506.07 was unconstitutional, and to compel defendant director of motor vehicles to issue a commercial driver's license, found that the action was barred by res judicata and sustained the director's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had previously filed an action in a federal district court that sought injunctive relief to compel various state officials to issue a commercial driver's license to him without requiring him to provide a social security number. The district court dismissed the action and after that dismissal the driver filed the within action in the court of appeals, which was also dismissed. The driver then filed the underlying action, which was transferred due to improper venue. On review the court found that the district court specifically declined to rule on the driver's state claims and the trial court erred in granting the director's motion for summary judgment on the basis of res judicata. The issue was whether the judgments in the federal action and the mandamus action were decisions on the merits. The court held that a motion to dismiss based on Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6) tested only the sufficiency of the complaint, was procedural in nature, and was not a judgment on the merits. The court held that the mandamus action was not res judicata to the declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the driver's assignment of error, reversed the common pleas court's order and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of breaking and entering. Defendant stipulated to a prior conviction specification for assault, a first-degree misdemeanor. The trial court sentenced defendant to an indefinite term of three to five years in prison. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on accomplice testimony. There was no indication that a particular witness was an accomplice or co-conspirator. The court further found that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser offense of conspiracy. Defense counsel did not request a conspiracy charge in writing as required by Ohio R. Crim. P. 30. Finally, the court found that defendant was never afforded a fair hearing on the issue of selective prosecution. A review of such a constitutional challenge required more than a mere listing of cases and a stapling of cases to the trial court record. Accordingly, the court held that defendant was entitled to a full evidentiary hearing on his claim that the State selectively prosecuted under the prior conviction specification provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.143.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence from the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County (Ohio) for aggravated assault, with a specification that he did cause physical harm to the victim, following a negotiated plea of guilty to that charge as a reduction from the original charge of felonious assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence for aggravated assault. He contended that the trial court participated in the plea bargaining process to an impermissible extent, thereby undermining the voluntariness of defendant's plea; that the trial court, in the sentencing proceeding, improperly asked questions of the victim, who was not under oath, and refused to permit defendant to cross-examine the victim; and that the trial court abused its discretion by imposing an indefinite sentence of not less than two, nor more than five, years' incarceration. In affirming, the court held that trial court did not interject itself in plea negotiations in any manner that would have affected the voluntariness of defendant's plea; that the trial court did not err when it permitted the victim, at the sentencing hearing, to make an unsworn statement, and asked the victim a question, but denied defendant the opportunity to cross-examine the victim; and, finally, that the sentence imposed was not an abuse of discretion. By entering his guilty plea, defendant forfeited his right to confront and cross-examine the victim.</SPAN></P>

She pled not guilty to this charge and the trial court granted her motion to dismiss on the ground that the license suspension provisions of &sect; 4511.191 were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court noted that it had previously determined that the administrative license suspension statutes did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and with the exception of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital obtained a default judgment against appellees, the mother and the father of a minor patient, for health care provided to the patient. The hospital attempted to collect the judgment by garnishing the wages of the father but was unable to garnish at the usual allowed rate of 25 percent provided to creditors under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2716.05 because of the 12 percent rate limitation on health care providers under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2716.021, 2716.051. The hospital filed a motion for a declaratory judgment that the statutes were unconstitutional because they violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The trial court denied the motion, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court noted that the statutes were presumed constitutional and found that the limitation on the rate of garnishment fell within the legislature's goal to provide Ohio citizens expanded access to affordable health care. Because the hospital failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the statutes beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial court properly denied the motion for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

The parties stipulated that the intoxilyzer was maintained and the test was conducted in accordance with Ohio Admin. Code ch. 3701-33. The trial court refused to allow defendant to submit evidence that his particular test was not accurate. Defendant pled no contest and was convicted. On appeal, the court found that the administrative license suspension imposed by the police officer was not a separate punishment and did not amount to double jeopardy. The failure of the police to warn defendant of the consequences of the test, and his ability to have someone of his choosing perform an additional test, did not require suppression of the test because the violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 were statutory and not constitutional. Defendant did have the right to challenge the accuracy of his specific test, and the court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The employee filed an action against the employer alleging that her injury was the result of the employer's intentional removal of the safety guard on the machine that injured the employee. The trial court found for the employee. The employer filed a notice of appeal with the supreme court. While the appeal was pending, the Ohio Supreme Court declared Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4121.80&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court overruled the employer's motion to dismiss and remanded the action for a hearing on damages. On appeal, the employer challenged the trial court's deciding both liability and damages. The court held that even though the trial court's denial of the employee's request for a jury trial was predicated upon the bifurcation required by &sect; 4121.80, the employer's jury demand was not timely filed. Moreover, under the remand order, the trial court was required to decide the damages issue. The court upheld the award of punitive damages and attorney fees, finding that the trial court correctly inferred malice from the employer's conduct.</SPAN></P>

The common pleas court rejected the Board's claim that it was justified in discharging the custodian for failing to list a prior conviction on his employment application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time he was hired as a five-hour custodian at an elementary school, the custodian was informed that his employment was conditioned upon a criminal records check by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation. The criminal records revealed that the custodian had been convicted of public indecency. The Commission affirmed the Board's discharge because of his prior conviction and for failure to list the conviction on his application. The common pleas court found that the custodian was not responsible for the care, custody, or control of a child for purposes of Ohio Code Ann. Rev. &sect; 3319.39. The sole issue was whether the lower court erred in holding that the custodian was not responsible for the care, custody, or control of a child within the meaning of &sect; 3319.39. The court held that a preponderance of the evidence supported the Commission's decision that the custodian was subject to discharge pursuant to &sect; 3319.39. He had responsibility for the care, custody, or control of children because he regularly had contact with children and could have been entrusted with their care during an emergency. The Commission's determination therefore should have been affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim of a robbery spent three minutes with the perpetrator in a bus stop before being robbed of money and jewelry at about 12:30 a.m. After being robbed, the victim called the police, and they apprehended defendant within 30 minutes after the robbery. Currency matching that taken from the victim was found on defendant. The victim was permitted to view defendant at a show-up that occurred very shortly after defendant was apprehended, and the victim testified at trial that he was 100 percent sure that defendant was the robber. Upon appeal, defendant's conviction and sentence were upheld. The court held that identification testimony was to be excluded only where identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Thus, because the victim's identification was sufficiently reliable, defendant's due process rights were not violated. The court further ruled that no right of defendant was violated because his sentence was enhanced based upon his status as a repeat offender; the statute of limitations did not any apply to the prior offense that caused the enhanced defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had placed the child in temporary custody with the private child placement agency. The mother could not take care of her daughter and she had declared that the father was not a suitable parent. The court found in part that the father waived his right to appeal as to the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.33 and Ohio R. Juv. P. 13. He did not timely raise these claims. The trial court was not required to adhere to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.419. The child was not removed from the home of her biological parents. She was committed to the temporary care and custody of the private placement agency pursuant to a court order lawfully made in compliance with Ohio R. Juv. P. 13. There was no merit to the father's argument that, in determining whether to commit the child to the temporary custody of agency, the trial court was required to place the child's best interest secondary to his rights. Pursuant to both Ohio R. Juv. P. 13 and Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellee juvenile, appellants, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles and its Registrar, sought review of a judgment from the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 violated the equal protection provisions of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol and the Bureau suspended his driving privileges for six months. The suspension arose under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169. On appeal, the Bureau argued that (1) the trial court should have dismissed the juvenile's complaint because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; and (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 did not violate any constitutional equal protection provisions. Upon review, the court agreed with the Bureau's second assignment of error. If the juvenile had reasonable concerns that the Bureau could not or would not have provided a fair and adequate hearing before his license suspension was to take effect, it was imperative that he preserve the record before the trial court in that regard. The juvenile did not make the record in the instant case. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 had to be read in pari materia with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4507.60, 4507.16 to allow a licensee facing a suspension under that provision to petition for occupational privileges. The juvenile failed to introduce evidence that the provision was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision finding that the statute was facially unconstitutional on equal protection grounds was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After processing at the police station, defendant was taken behind a partition where he recited a statement that an assailant uttered to one of the crime victims during the robbery. Law enforcement staff told the victim that she was about to hear a suspect's voice. Defendant was not formally charged at the time of the voice identification procedure; thus, he had no constitutional right to the presence of counsel during that procedure. The procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; however, the likelihood of misidentification was not very substantial because the assailant who spoke during the robbery was directly beside the witness who identified defendant's voice. Moreover, the victim was the person spoken to by the assailant, rather than a casual observer, and the identification procedure was conducted within a few hours after the robbery. Moreover, the victim identified defendant's voice immediately and unequivocally, and the reliability of that identification was corroborated by a considerable amount of other evidence. In view of the overwhelming evidence that identified defendant as a perpetrator, admission of the victim's pretrial identification did not constitute plain error.</SPAN></P>

The corporation contended that the trial court committed reversible error in granting defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court determined that summary judgment was appropriately granted on the corporation's procedural due process claim because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 6117 provided adequate procedural safeguards consistent with the requirements of procedural due process. The court explained that ch. 6117 was complied with because there were four public hearings held by the county upon due notice. The court noted that because the corporation conceded that its members' properties would have received an increase in property value, it could not have claimed that the improvement violated the substantive due process rights of its members. The court concluded that there was no competent evidence in the record to support the corporation's allegations that the improvement would not have conferred special benefits to their properties.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order.

The court determined that the trial court's remedy was not unconstitutional. The court ruled that the officers could not benefit from a successful appeal by a police association because they did not participate in the appeal and their rights were not interwoven with or dependent upon the rights of the association's members. The court held that the officers were not entitled to a jury trial because they sought equitable relief and the case was submitted to the trial court upon undisputed facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee drunk driver pled no contest to new drunk driving charges. As a recidivist offender, she was subject to a mandatory term of confinement, license suspension, and immobilization of the vehicle she drove. She filed a motion to declare the mandatory sentencing statute unconstitutional, and the court granted that motion, striking the law. Appellant state government took an appeal. The court reversed all but one small portion of the trial judge's order, and remanded the case for resentencing. In so ruling, it rejected, one-by-one, appellee's claims that the mandatory sentencing statute violated due process, equal protection, the prohibition on ex post facto laws, the prohibition on cruel punishments, the prohibition on excessive fines, and the separation of powers doctrine. In some instances, the court held that appellee lacked standing to challenge certain provisions of the mandatory sentencing statute since they were inapplicable to her (she not having reached the number of prior convictions triggering those provisions). The only part of the trial judge's order that was upheld was the complete bar on judicial stays of administratively-issued license suspension orders.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then jumped up and continued running. After they caught defendant, the officers found two bags of powdery substance, later determined to contain cocaine, in the bushes. After his arrest, defendant told the police officers that the drugs belonged to the other suspect, who was a drug dealer. A forensic scientist testified that one bag contained 4.81 grams of the powdery mixture and the other bag contained 27.90 grams of the powdery mixture. The forensic scientist also testified that both mixtures contained cocaine. Defendant was convicted of possessing cocaine in an amount equal to or exceeding three times the bulk amount, which was ten grams.

Code Ann. &sect; 707.11 prohibited opponents of a proposed incorporation from challenging an order of incorporation through an administrative appeal. In order to resolve the conflict between the specific remedy under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 707.11 and the general right to an administrative appeal under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.01, the court looked to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.51. The court thus held that the general provisions of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The psychologist had given the patient psychological counseling for her feelings of regret over giving up a child for adoption. The psychologist and patient then began a sexual relationship, and the psychologist pronounced her &quot;cured.&quot; Thereafter, office visits consisted only of sexual encounters. The patient then claimed that all memory of the relationship was repressed for 25 years, until a more recent therapy uncovered the memories. Affirming the trial court, the court held that the patient's claims based purely upon acts of sexual assault were governed by the one-year statute of limitations pertaining to assault and battery, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.111, even though she also pleaded negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Her claims for psychological malpractice were subject to the one-year limitations period set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.11. The discovery rule applied, but the patient failed to file her complaint within one year of discovering the abuse. The court rejected the patient's claim that the statute should be tolled under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16, because there was no evidence that the patient was of &quot;unsound mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the ordinance was presumptively valid and found that defendants had not rebutted that presumption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), for menacing by stalking, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.211, contending that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that trial counsel was ineffective, that his conviction was based on insufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In examining appellant's challenge to the anti-stalking statute's constitutionality, the court held that the pattern of conduct was sufficiently defined, the language was simple and easily understood, one incident was insufficient to invoke the statute, and ambiguity in defining a time frame was a question for the factfinder. The court held that the scienter requirement, that the offender must be aware that his conduct would probably cause the victim to expect physical harm or mental distress, vitiated any claim that the statute's purported vagueness could mislead the average person into misunderstanding what was prohibited, and the statute criminalized conduct only when taken with the requisite mental state. The court held that the statute established sufficient guidelines for its enforcement, narrow in scope but explicit enough for law enforcement guidance, and the state had a compelling interest in protecting citizens from this behavior. The court found the statute neither vague nor overbroad, and the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to prove the elements of menacing by stalking beyond a reasonable doubt, with appellant as the perpetrator. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which convicted appellant for menacing by stalking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign corporation contended that the trial court erred in refusing to hold a proper post-attachment hearing, that the statutory scheme authorizing the ex parte attachment of assets was unconstitutional, and that its motion to vacate the order of attachment was wrongly denied. However, the appellate court rejected the foreign corporation's arguments and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The procedures employed by the trial court during the post-attachment hearing complied with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2715.043(B) and 2715.045(D). The attachment order issued by the trial court in this case did not violate due process principles.

The licensee sought review of that order and the court reversed the decision and certified the cause to the Ohio Supreme Court pursuant to Ohio Const. art.

The court held that the decision constituted a final appealable order because the inquiry constituted an independent judicial inquiry totally separate from the criminal charge against the licensee for driving under the influence of alcohol. The arresting officer's right to automatically suspend the licensee's driving privileges prior to a hearing at her initial appearance before the trial court was an unconstitutional violation of her right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by a police officer failing to use his left turn indicator while making a left turn and veering into the oncoming lane of traffic, arrested, and administered a breath alcohol test at the police station. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress the results of the breath alcohol test on the basis that the initial stop of his vehicle was without probable cause. The court determined that the police officer's observations of defendant's aberrant driving constituted probable cause. Further, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.20 did not provide defendant with a right to counsel prior to taking a breath alcohol test and that, in any event, there was no basis for finding defendant was denied the right to private communication with his attorney. However, the court reversed the trial court's judgment because there had been a failure to substantially comply with Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3701-53-02(C) app. H, which required a radio frequency interference survey of the police station's base radio where, as here, the antenna had been within 30 feet of the device used to administer the breath alcohol test to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county board of commissioners heard testimony concerning the annexation of the property as proposed by the owners and denied the annexation. The trial court affirmed the decision of the commissioners. On appeal the court held that the trial court erred in affirming the decision of the board of county commissioners where there was no substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the record to support the board's conclusions. The lower court erred as a matter of law by not overruling the finding of the board of commissioners that the general good of the territory sought to be annexed would not be served by the annexation. In addition, the board's opinion that the general economic condition and tax rate would not benefit the territory sought to be annexed was not supported by any evidence in the record. The urban acquisition of property was strongly favored in Ohio and one of the intentions of the legislature in enacting statutes governing annexation was to give an owner of property freedom of choice as to the governmental subdivision in which he desired his property to be located.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A captain's vacancy existed in the city's fire department and was filled when the fire chief requested and received a voluntary demotion to that position under City of Parma, Ohio, Civil Service Commission Rules and Regs. R. IX, &sect; 6 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.31. The remaining captain was promoted to chief and that captain's position was filled by the first lieutenant on the promotion list. The lieutenant, who was second on the list, requested that the commission also appoint him as captain. The commission refused and the lieutenant filed an administrative appeal and a declaratory judgment action to determine his rights under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.45, 124.46. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees and the lieutenant appealed. The court affirmed, finding that &sect;&sect; 124.45, 124.46 would normally supersede Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 124.31, which permitted the chief's voluntary demotion, because the former statutes were more specific in requiring promotions to fill vacant ranks.

The corporation filed a complaint, seeking a declaration of the rights of the parties, a temporary restraining order, and a mandatory injunction that required the Department to evaluate the corporation's original application. The court of common pleas dismissed the action on the ground that it was without jurisdiction to hear the claims. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the court of common pleas erred in dismissing the action on jurisdictional grounds because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.31 conferred jurisdiction upon the court of common pleas whenever a party sought declaratory or injunctive relief. The court stated that the Department could be sued for such relief in cases other than those involving real estate leases or contracts, and that exclusive jurisdiction over such cases rested with the court of common pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the trial court erred in holding that the employee was not entitled to be paid for his accumulated vacation upon his retirement. The employee's argument in support of his assignment of error was predicated upon the trial court's finding on remand that the employee had until a certain date to use his vacation time. On appeal, the court did not address the merits of the employee's argument as the court concluded that the trial court exceeded the scope of its authority in revisiting this issue on remand. The court held that absent extraordinary circumstances, such as an intervening decision by the Supreme Court, an inferior court had no discretion to disregard the mandate of a superior court in a prior appeal in the same case. The court held that the fact was established on remand that the employee did not take his accumulated vacation time prior to the end of 1989. In accordance with the court's prior decision, the unused accumulated vacation time had been forfeited as a matter of law.

The Board concluded that the general good of the entire area would not be served when only a majority of the property owners in the northern half of the area supported the annexation. The trial court correctly affirmed the Board's decision to deny appellants' annexation petition. The court overruled appellants' assignments of error. The trial court understood the scope of its review and applied the correct standard of review under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506. The Board correctly considered the general good of separate areas within the annexation territory. The court found that appellants' contention that municipal service delivery would be qualitatively different throughout the annexation territory was not supported by case law. The court found that none of the cases involved a large number of property owners opposed to annexation and distributed primarily within a distinct portion of the territory. The court decided that the Board had discretion under Ohio Rev. Code. Ann. &sect; 709.033(E) to decide whether annexation served the general good of the territory that would have been subject to annexation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Ohio) convicting her of trafficking in marijuana and sentencing her to one and one-half years incarceration, which was suspended, five years probation, and suspension of her driver's license for six months. Defendant's conviction was entered on her plea of no contest. Defendant's appeal was limited to the suspension of her driver's license, ordered pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925-03(M).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's claim of error on appeal was that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(M) was unconstitutional in that it the means chosen by the legislature, namely motor vehicle license suspension, was not rationally related to the goal of the legislature at issue; the safe operation of motor vehicles. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A)(1) provided that the trial court had to either revoke defendant's driver's license or suspend it for at least six months. The terms of the statute were mandatory and the court noted that the statute had previously been held to be constitutionally valid. Defendant also argued that her participation in the crime was limited in that she admitted to assisting a drug dealer with whom she and her two children were living by scooping out a portion of the marijuana that he was preparing to sell to an undercover agent because his hand injuries prevented him from doing it himself. The court held that her motivation of helping someone who had been helping her did not excuse the commission of the crime, though it may have resulted in leniency when punishment was imposed. The requisite mental culpability was that she had acted &quot;knowingly,&quot; which she admitted that she had.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio), which upon his plea of no contest found defendant guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs (OMVI). Defendant pled no contest after the trial court denied his motion to dismiss the charge on the grounds that the administrative license suspension (ALS) statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was impounded when he was arrested for OMVI, an ALS was imposed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 because he refused to take a breath test, and his vehicle and license plates were seized pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.195 because he had two prior OMVI convictions within five years. Defendant claimed both statutes were unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 was constitutional for equal protection purposes because the right to drive was a privilege and ALS was rationally related to the legitimate interest of protecting the public from repeat offenders and those who refused to consent to a test. The court found that a provision prohibiting any court from staying an ALS violated separation of powers, but was severable. The court concluded that because an illegal act had to occur after their effective dates, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 and 4511.99 were not ex post facto laws and that the state could punish recidivists more severely. The court applied the three-pronged Mathews test and determined that due process did not require a pre-ALS or pre-seizure hearing.</SPAN></P>

The zoning board denied the variance. The city had previously filed declaratory judgment actions against two other appellees, applicants who had installed dead-end lines. The first applicant's appeal was consolidated with the declaratory judgment action. The city argued that dead-end lines would not provide sufficient pressure to other hydrants when one hydrant was open. The applicants argued that the city failed to show that the non-looped system was yielding inadequate water pressure. The trial court determined that the city ordinance was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further review, holding that there was insufficient evidence to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality of the ordinance and that the applicants did not sustain their burden of proof to show the ordinance was unreasonable and not necessary to the health, safety, and welfare of the city's residents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Licking County (Ohio), which convicted defendant of trafficking in marijuana, sentenced him to a 12-month sentence, a fine, and suspended defendant's driving privileges for one year. Defendant subsequently filed a motion for shock probation and requested occupational driving privileges. Both requests were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of trafficking in marijuana. On appeal, defendant challenged the appropriateness of a stop conducted by state troopers, the reliability of an informant, and the applicability of the &quot;fellow officer rule&quot; to the case. All of the factors of the case, taken as a whole, supported the stop by state troopers at the request of the city police. Therefore, probable cause existed to conduct a Terry stop of defendant and his constitutional rights were not violated. The city officers had a right to rely on the informant since the officers knew her and she had been reliable in the past. At least part of the information provided by the informant was immediately verifiable at the scene. Defendant argued that the &quot;fellow officer rule&quot; could not be used to cure an otherwise illegal stop. However, the city police had probable cause to stop defendant. Therefore, a radio broadcast to the state highway patrol was an adequate foundation for the state trooper to conduct a stop of defendant. The one-year suspension of defendant's driver's license was not inappropriate. Finally, there was no error in the denial of defendant's motion for acquittal.</SPAN></P>

It applied equally to all prospective bidders and did not require any contractor to become a union employer. It simply required any person or entity to agree to be bound by the same rules and restrictions as all other similarly engaged. While the agreement required contractors to use local union facilities for selecting applicants, it was required to do so on a non-discriminatory basis. The agreement did not conflict with the purposes underlying competitive bidding statutes of enabling a public contracting authority to obtain the best work at the lowest possible price while guarding against favoritism and fraud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and was sentenced to a prison term of two years. In addition, the trial judge ordered that his driver's license be suspended for a period of five years. Defendant appealed, claiming that the suspension statute was unconditional because it violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The court affirmed. The court noted that all laws were presumed constitutional. The court held that a driver's license was not a fundamental right. Therefore, the appropriate level of scrutiny was the &quot;rational basis&quot; test. The court found that suspending the license of a convicted drug offender was reasonably related to the legislative goal of impeding the transportation and distribution of illegal drugs, and the suspension did not violate defendant's due process rights. The court opined that a suspension of a drug offender's license rationally furthered the interest in reducing the sale and distribution of drugs. The court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee appealed the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which directed a verdict in favor of defendant city, defendants police chief and detective, and defendant officers in her action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for an unannounced forced entry into her apartment to execute a narcotics warrant. The officers, who were not named in the original complaint, cross-appealed the denial of their motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police entry team broke down the arrestee's door without knocking and restrained her. The arrestee brought her action and named the city, police chief and one detective but designated the remaining defendants as &quot;unknown officers.&quot; An answer was filed on behalf of the defendants. The arrestee amended her complaint to name the officers after the statute of limitations ran but never served the newly named officers. On appeal, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.12(A) codified the common law rule prohibiting unannounced intrusions into a dwelling, known as the &quot;knock and announce&quot; principle, and that unannounced entries violated the Fourth Amendment absent exigent circumstances. The court rejected a blanket rule that narcotics warrants involved exigent circumstances per se, and required police to establish a particularized need for an unannounced entry. The court further held that while Ohio R. Civ. P. 3 allowed an additional year to perfect service on previously unidentified parties, the failure of the arrestee to serve the officers under Ohio R. Civ. P. 15(D) and the lack of a general answer in their names resulted in a lack of personal jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court that directed a verdict against the arrestee because there were questions of fact as to whether her Fourth Amendment rights were violated by city customs or policies. The court also reversed a denial of the previously unnamed officers' motion to dismiss and ordered a dismissal with prejudice as to them. The court remanded for proceedings against the city, police chief, and named detective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment enjoining the director from operating her preschool because she was in violation of the city zoning ordinance as she had employed a non-family member to work at her preschool which was operating from her home. The court rejected the director's claim that the city ordinance was in conflict with the general law. The court noted that the party claiming conflict must have affirmatively demonstrated that the state regulatory scheme was intended to totally eclipse municipal regulation within the same subject area. The court held that the state and municipal regulations presented dual conditions to the operation of a home business in the city and in the absence of an express state legislative intent to preempt such it was permissible. The court noted that the director was still able to use her property as a home. The court rejected the director's claim that the city was equitably estopped from enforcing its zoning ordinances against her property because the director failed to establish that the city made a misleading representation. Therefore, the facts that the city gave her a license and that she operated for two years were without consequence.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, and each filed a motion to dismiss the underlying charges on the grounds of double jeopardy. On the consolidated appeal, defendants argued that the trial court erred in overruling their motions to dismiss. The court, in affirming defendants' convictions, disagreed. The court applied a three-pronged test and found that defendants' claims satisfied only two of the three prongs. The court noted that the claims satisfied the &quot;same offence&quot; and the &quot;separate proceedings&quot; elements of the double jeopardy test but that they did not satisfy the &quot;punishment&quot; element of the test. The court held that an ALS imposed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191, for failure to submit to a chemical test or for testing above the prohibited alcohol concentration, was non-punitive and remedial in nature and thus did not constitute punishment under the double jeopardy clause of either Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas of Stark County (Ohio), overturned two resolutions by the Board of Stark County Commissioners to deny petitions by a city and a village to annex overlapping territories pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.02. Appellant village challenged the city's attempt to annex territories in violation of the statute. Appellant township, which had been annexed, argued that reversal of the Board's decision was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.02 required that a majority of landowners in a territory petition for annexation. The city wanted to annex a territory but did not have the support of a majority. It added separate, unconnected territories to its petition to obtain enough landowner signatures to constitute a majority in its application to the Board. The village, which sought to annex much of the same land, argued on appeal that to permit the city to annex territory in that way was reversible error. The court agreed. Although &sect; 709.02 was intended to encourage annexation, the process was designed to meet the annexed landowners' needs and desires. The court held that the city's &quot;bootstrapping&quot; violated the spirit and purpose of the annexation code. In its appeal, the township argued that the trial court abused its discretion by overturning the Board's decision to deny annexation. The Board had found that the annexation was for the general good of the territory pursuant to &sect; 709.33 but that the petition lacked sufficient signatures; after the signatures were obtained, the Board denied the petition. The court agreed with the trial court that the Board's action was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision to overturn the Board's resolution and to permit annexation by the city. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to overturn the Board's resolution and to permit annexation by the village. The court remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the common pleas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the neighbor did not file the notice of his appeal of the grant of the certificate in the place that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2505.04 mandated. The court also held that, if the common pleas court had jurisdiction over the action, it would have been possible to treat the administrative appeal that the neighbor filed several weeks before there was a signed final administrative order as premature per Ohio R.

The court rejected this contention, holding that the evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of menacing by stalking. Defendant next contended that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to challenge the constitutional validity of the stalking statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev.

On review, the court found no error because the lien holders were not entitled to intervention as of right under Ohio R. Civ. P. 24(A). The court concluded that the disposition of the case, which resulted in an order to sell the property, did not impair the owners' ability to protect their interests. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in not allowing a permissive intervention under Ohio R. Civ. P. 24(B). The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to vacate the entry confirming the sale pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(A), (B) because that rule applied only to parties. The court concluded that the trial court was not required to conduct a hearing and that it correctly held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5721.18(C) was constitutional. Under the statute, the purchaser of the property took his interest subject to lien holders without notice of the sale.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a couple who won the Ohio lottery, filed an action against appellees, the State Lottery Commission, the Ohio Department of Taxation, and state officials, in which the couple sought a declaratory judgment that state taxation of their winnings breached a contract and that the statutes imposing the tax were unconstitutional. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) granted summary judgment for appellees. The couple appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988, after winning the Ohio lottery twice, the couple moved to Florida. In 1989, Ohio amended Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5747.02 to provide that lottery winnings would be subject to Ohio income tax. Thereafter, under Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3770.072 and 5747.062, the couple had their taxes automatically deducted from their lottery installment payments. The court rejected the argument that the tax violated due process. The couple were residents of Ohio when they purchased and redeemed their winning tickets, and they could enforce their rights to receive the proceeds in the Ohio courts. Thus, a sufficient nexus with Ohio had been established to permit Ohio to tax the installment payments. The fact that the couple received the income in Florida did not deprive Ohio of its jurisdiction to tax. Next, the court held that Ohio had not breached its contracts with the couple. There was no contractual provision that the lottery winnings would be exempt from Ohio income tax. Finally, because the taxable event was the receipt of income in a particular year, taxation of the lottery installments under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.02 did not constitute a retroactive application of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had granted declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive relief to appellee estate administrator on his complaint that challenged the constitutionality of a city housing ordinance. The trial court determined that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied against appellee, and permanently enjoined appellant city from prosecuting him for not complying with the ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed the declaratory judgment for appellee and remanded for determination on whether it was barred by appellant's affirmative defense of res judicata. If it was not barred, then the determination needed to be on whether appellee met the exception for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and whether he was an owner under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 93.02 that was authorized by a probate court under Ohio. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2113.311 to manage the real property. Finally, the court vacated the permanent injunction against appellant because a court of equity could not intervene in a criminal prosecution unless the ordinance was found unconstitutional and its enforcement infringed upon vested property rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one count of attempted aggravated trafficking and one count of drug abuse. Her conduct did not involve the use of a motor vehicle. Upon her plea of guilty to the count of attempted aggravated trafficking, the drug abuse count was dismissed. In sentencing defendant, the court of common pleas suspended her operator's license. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.11(F)(1), 4507.16(D)(2), as the statutes mandated the suspension of driving privileges for those found guilty of certain drug offenses. Specifically, defendant contended that the mandatory license suspension bore no rational relationship to the charged offense and, as such, violated her rights to due process and equal protection. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence on appeal, the court held that defendant failed to prove that the challenged statutes were violative of her constitutional rights.

The husband did not request a continuance of the hearing but did voice his objection to not having a jury trial and not having discovery. The wife testified that the husband had threatened her. The court held that: (1) the husband was entitled to a continuance where he did not request one; (2) the husband's argument as to the unconstitutionality of Ohio Rev.

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found any error the trial court may have committed when it dismissed a portion of defendant's motion to suppress was cured when the trial court reversed itself and scheduled a hearing. The court held the trial court did not error by failing to uphold defendant's motion to suppress that was based upon defendant's arrest allegedly being a pretext arrest where defendant's act of driving off of the paved roadway gave the police reasonable suspicion to believe defendant was driving under the influence. The court determined defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings at the time that he was initially stopped by the police where defendant's freedom of movement was not restrained to such an extent that he was in custody. The court concluded it was not unconstitutionally coercive to allow the police to use an administrative license form to secure a breath test where there was nothing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(C) that required the police to specifically inform an arrestee of criminal penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's license was suspended pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4511.191 because he refused to submit to a chemical test when he was arrested for driving under the influence. He filed a notice of appeal with the trial court, claiming that he was unable to take such a test because of injuries sustained in an accident. He also filed a motion seeking driving privileges to and from his chiropractor. The trial court dismissed the notice of appeal and motion for driving privileges. On appeal, the driver's counsel, who was not the same person as his trial counsel, filed a document entitled &quot;statement of the record,&quot; which did not comply with Ohio R. App. P. 9(C) and alleged events in support of the driver's claim that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of his constitutional rights. The court found that it was bound by the record, which did not contain any facts that supported the driver's claims. The court held further that it would be a grave injustice to all the parties who had properly complied with Ohio R. App. P. 9(C), and a gross violation by the court of its own rules, to accept the &quot;statement of the record&quot; and base a decision thereupon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Champaign County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied his pro se petition for post-conviction relief. He was represented by counsel at his criminal trial and by different counsel in his unsuccessful appeal. He contended, in part, that he was denied due process during his trial because his counsel failed to ensure that prejudicial information was redacted from fingerprint cards submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based, in part, on fingerprint identification. At trial, the State introduced fingerprint cards. Because the cards also included information regarding his parole violation, the trial court ordered that information redacted before the cards were given to the jury. The redacted cards were also put into evidence. On appeal, the court held that defendant failed to meet his initial burden of submitting evidentiary documents to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel. As his only evidence was a copy of cards taken from his attorney's file, he did not prove what was submitted to the jury. The trial court could rely on its own memory that only the redacted cards were given to the jury. Defendant's affidavit to the contrary was self-serving and could not be used to satisfy his initial burden. Defendant did not have a constitutional right to appointed counsel for the post-conviction hearing. Further, by not meeting his initial burden of proof, he was not entitled to such a hearing. His argument that a statute was unconstitutional was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, because he could have raised the argument at trial or on direct appeal, but did not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the suspension of her operator's license pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 2925.11 was unconstitutional, and a second suspension imposed was not authorized by the city ordinance upon which it was based. The court found that the suspension of an operator's license for violation of the drug laws was constitutional. No suspect classification was involved so there need only be a reasonable relationship between the law and its intended purpose. The court noted that the legislative exercise of the police power would be valid if it had a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public and if it is not unreasonable or arbitrary. The court deferred to the legislature's judgment on the relationship to public health, safety, and morals and found the statute constitutional. The court reversed the second suspension imposed for violation of the city ordinance against possession of drug paraphernalia, however, because that penalty was not authorized by the ordinance in question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the trial court (Ohio), which convicted him on one count of vaginal rape, one count of attempted vaginal rape, two counts of oral rape, and one count of gross sexual imposition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the statements made to police were involuntary. This argument was based in part on defendant's testimony that he had requested to speak to his attorney. However, that evidence was not presented to the trial court in connection with the motion to suppress. The court held that the motion to suppress was the exclusive remedy for improperly obtained evidence under Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(B)(3). Therefore, defendant could not present new evidence at trial and then base his appeal on that additional evidence. The court agreed with defendant that his rape convictions should be merged, however. All of the penetrations occurred within a relatively short period of time and did not subject the victim to any new or additional risk. Therefore, the vaginal rape charge merged with the charge of attempted vaginal rape, and the two counts of oral rape merged into one. The conviction for gross sexual imposition remained separate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but found that the multiple convictions for oral rape were merged and that the convictions for vaginal rape and attempted vaginal rape were merged. The sentence was unchanged because the trial court had already ordered that the sentences for multiple offenses be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patrolmen's association asked the State Employment Relations Board, to recognize it as a collective bargaining unit. The board found that the association was not a public employer within the meaning of Ohio Rev.

The trial court affirmed the board's decision, as did the court, which found that the trial court's statutory interpretation of &sect; 4117.01(B), was supported by substantial evidence pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 119.2. Although the association asserted that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 4117.01(B), violated the Equal Protection Clause, Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, the court found that the classification of public employers in fact bore a rational relationship to a state interest. Further, the court found that &sect; 4117.01(B), was constitutionally uniform under Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26, because it operated equally upon all state employees. No employees in the State of Ohio that were situated in the same position as the association were permitted to bargain collectively. Finally, the court found that the definition of public employer provide for in &sect; 4117.01(B), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the chiropractor was not required to arrive at a diagnosis or to make a report of findings because there was no physician-patient relationship. The potential patient did not intend to become a patient, but only took advantage of the free examination. The court held that the agency lacked standing to appeal the trial court's judgment because the trial court did not rule on a question of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. On review, the court affirmed. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in failing to suppress certain evidence. The court found that observation of a traffic violation, such as speeding, was sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion to support a routine traffic stop. The police officer credibly testified that he visually observed defendant speeding, and that the radar device confirmed that defendant was traveling approximately seventeen miles over the speed limit. A seventeen-mile excess was not a &quot;minor&quot; speeding violation, but, rather, was a substantial violation. Further, the officer testified that he observed defendant pass two cars at a high rate of speed. Under these facts, the court found no persuasive reason to deviate or carve an exception to the general rule that observation of a traffic violation by an officer was sufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandmother challenged a decision of the Warren County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division (Ohio), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, a bank trustee and individuals as next best friends on behalf of her grandchildren, two minors, and ordered a hearing for a determination of frivolous conduct. The grandmother's lawsuit alleged that she was entitled to the minors' trust funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother of the two minors died in a car accident. Upon settlement of a wrongful death action, the trial court created an irrevocable trust pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.03(A)(2), under which the funds were placed in trust for the minors for the distribution to the minors when they turned 25 years old. After their mother's death, their uncle and aunt, with their natural father's consent, adopted them. The grandmother's lawsuit alleged that pursuant to the Ohio adoption statute, the minors had become the children of someone else and no longer had any legal right to share in the trust funds. The trial court refused to terminate the trust and found that when the wrongful death action was settled, the minors were proper beneficiaries and that their subsequent adoption had not affected their beneficiary status. In affirming the judgment, the court agreed with the trial court and also found that the contingency language in the trust agreement that purported to transfer the minors' trust funds to the grandmother as next of kin, in the event both children died without issue, was invalid and against public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in part, which was entered against the grandmother with respect to her lack of entitlement to the minors' trust funds. The court also dismissed the trial court's summary judgment in part and deferred ruling on the appellees' request for fees and costs, for a period of 60 days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action involving the suspension of the driver's license of appellee driver, appellant Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) appealed a judgment of the Butler County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which found Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was convicted in Kentucky with driving under the influence of alcohol. The BMV notified the driver that pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 his Ohio driver's license would be suspended for six months as a result of his Kentucky conviction. The driver lost an administrative appeal, but the trial court granted his request for an order suspending execution of the BMV's order. The driver claimed that he already served the suspension ordered pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169 and the appeal was moot. The court found that even though the driver had served his suspension, the case fell within the &quot;public rights&quot; exception to the mootness doctrine. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. It held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2507.169 did not violate the equal protection provisions of either the Ohio or United States Constitutions when read in pari materia with the Drivers License Compact, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4507.60 and 4507.16, which allowed a motorist whose license was suspended to petition the municipal or county court where the motorist resided for occupational driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

The trial court suspended the terms of incarceration and suspended part of the fine. Defendant was placed on inactive probation and ordered to perform community service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attended a meeting of the city council. At the close of the public portion of the meeting the city council announced they were proceeding to an executive session. The public was asked to leave, and everyone save defendant complied with the request. Defendant indicated that he would rather be arrested than leave. The police who were present at the scene requested that defendant leave and advised him that he would be arrested if he persisted in his refusal. Defendant was then placed under arrest because his refusal to leave council chambers prevented the city council from continuing with their executive session. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not err in its interpretation that the word &quot;lawful&quot; as used in the ordinance indicated a formal meeting as opposed to an informal gathering. Because the trial court heard testimony that just such a meeting was conducted, sufficient evidence was presented to support defendant's conviction. Defendant's argument that the city failed to present evidence that the disruption of the meeting was substantial was also not well taken because the ordinance made no requirement that a disruption be &quot;substantial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The employer filed a motion to intervene in the action pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 24. The employer argued that Ohio Rev.

The trial court denied the employer's motion to intervene. The court affirmed and determined that the trial court properly denied intervention in the case. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.93, as amended, did not apply because it did not exist on the date of the employee's slip and fall. The court concluded that the statute could not be applied retroactively. The court found that the trial court had correctly refused to apply Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.93 to the action because the employer failed to demonstrate an interest in the litigation as required by Ohio R. Civ. P. 24(A). The court determined that the employer had no basis to complain that an inadequate record was presented because the trial court provided a statement of the proceedings, which set forth its reasons for denying the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' demand in their original complaint did not include a specific dollar amount.

Defendants admitted liability, and the trial of this case was limited to the issue of damages. Following the verdict, and without seeking leave from the trial court, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in which they increased their demand. The trial court granted defendants' motion to strike, denied plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint, and granted defendants' motion to reduce the verdict. The court held that: (1) the Ohio Supreme Court recognized that Rule 54(C) acted in concert with Ohio R. Civ. P. Rule 8(A), which required plaintiffs to specify an amount in their original complaint; (2) although amended Ohio R. Civ. P. 54(C) took effect when the case was pending, application of the amended Rule 54(C) would not have been feasible; and (3) plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they would have been unable to discover the extent of the passenger's injuries prior to trial through the exercise of due diligence.</SPAN></P>

However, a special statutory proceeding, post-conviction relief pursuant to &sect; 2953.21, was available to the prisoner. Because the prisoner had an adequate remedy under &sect; 2953.21, he was not allowed to seek declaratory relief. Thus, the trial court properly granted appellees' motion. The prisoner argued that he was unconstitutionally denied access to the jail library and free copy service while attempting to prosecute the instant action. The prisoner's complaint was dismissed on the legal basis that an adequate remedy existed. The court held that the prisoner had not demonstrated a violation of his constitutional rights because he had not alleged or demonstrated that the outcome in the instant action would have been different if he had been provided photocopy and library services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted her of theft, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for one count of theft of property under &sect; 2913.02 and one count of trafficking in food stamps. Defendant moved to dismiss the theft count based on the contention that she should have been charged with either falsification under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921(A)(4) or fraud in the Aid to Dependant Children statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5107.04 as opposed to theft. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, and defendant entered a plea of no contest to the theft count. Defendant was found guilty of theft. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that from the clear language of the statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5107.04 was not a criminal offense but rather a civil remedy. Section 5107.04 defined &quot;erroneous payments&quot; and provided for the recovery of such payments. Unlike Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02, nowhere did Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5107.04 state a positive duty or enjoin a specific duty. Accordingly, the elements of both provisions did not constitute allied offenses of similar import. Thus, the trial court did not err in its application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.51 or in its denial of defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and remanded the cause to the trial court for execution of sentence.</SPAN></P>

The property owners sought review of the city council's decision in the trial court, and argued that the ordinance conflicted with the Ohio Const. art. XVIII &sect; 11.

Upon review, the court found that the trial court did lack jurisdiction, reversed the judgment, and dismissed the appeal. The court held that the city council's decision to adopt the Board's recommendation was not a result of the exercise of the city council's quasi-judicial authority, but was rather an exercise of the city's council's legislative authority, and thus was not subject to review in an administrative appeal.</SPAN></P>

The Marion County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) found that the common law negligent design claim was eliminated by the Tort Reform Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.71 et seq., and granted summary judgment to the manufacturer on the claims of defective design, inadequate warnings, and the affirmative defense of assumption of risk. The press operator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The press operator argued that the press lacked adequate warnings, that the press was defectively designed, and that the negligent design claim was not statutorily abolished. Further, the press operator argued that assumption of risk was not available as an affirmative defense because his injury arose in the employment context. The court rejected the arguments of the press operator. The court applied the two tests in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.75 and found that the press was not defectively designed under the consumer expectation test or the risk utility test. The court held that the warnings supplied by the manufacturer were adequate as a matter of law. Moreover, the court found that the press operator knew more about the particular product than any warning could ever provide. The court concluded that the legislature codified all product liability claims against manufacturers in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2307.71-.80, and a common law cause of action for negligent design was no longer viable in Ohio. Further, the affirmative defense of assumption of risk, codified at Ohio Rev.

Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169&nbsp;unconstitutional under the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. Appellee licensee had been convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) and had filed an action that sought to enjoin appellants from suspending his driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was convicted of DUI in Kentucky. The BMV notified him that based upon his conviction in Kentucky, it was suspending his driver's license for six months. The licensee filed an administrative appeal and filed an action in the trial court to enjoin appellants. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.169(B) mandated that the BMV suspend the license of any resident of Ohio who was convicted under any other state statute that was &quot;substantially similar&quot; to Ohio's DUI provision. Although &sect; 4507.169 did not specifically provide that the licensee was allowed to petition the trial court for occupational driving privileges, &sect; 4507.169 did not unambiguously preclude Ohio courts from granting occupational driving privileges to an individual whose license had been suspended under that section. It simply did not address the matter. The court read &sect; 4507.169 in pari materia with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.16 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.60 to allow a licensee to petition the municipal or common pleas court in which that licensee resided for occupational driving privileges.

Defendant was convicted of carrying an oversized knife in violation of Akron, Ohio, City Ordinance &sect; 137.02(A). The court reversed. Defendant's conviction was vacated because the provision of the ordinance under which he was convicted was an unreasonable exercise of the police power in violation of substantive due process. The knife provision criminalized an unreasonable amount of inherently innocent activity, and prohibiting so much innocent activity had no rational connection to protecting the public from the violent use of knives.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to beginning his shift, an officer was told that defendant's vehicle was parked all day at a bar. The officer knew that defendant's license was suspended. The officer saw defendant driving his vehicle. The officer noticed a crack in the windshield, so he pulled the car over. The officer administered field sobriety tests, which defendant failed. He was arrested and submitted a urine sample.

In affirming the convictions, the court found that the officer had reasonable suspicion that defendant was violating the law when he was stopped based upon the known license suspension, the cracked windshield, and the spotting of defendant's car at a local bar. There was no evidence that the officer badgered defendant to submit a urine sample. The jury was in the best position to determine the officer's credibility, and the disparity in statutory punishments for felonies and misdemeanors did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which convicted him of drug abuse and possession of drug paraphernalia and, as mandated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.11(F)(1) and 2925.14(H), suspended his drivers license for a period of one hundred and eighty days for each offense to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the mandatory license suspension imposed by the legislature in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2925.11(F)(1) and 2925.14(H) bore no rational relationship to the offenses charged and, therefore, violated his right to due process and constituted cruel and unusual punishment On appeal, the court disagreed. Because the criminal violations subjected the offender to only a small fine, the legislature could have concluded that the prospect of losing one's driver's license was necessary to deter a potential drug user from experimenting and committing a first drug offense. At the very least, the potential user might think twice and consider the loss of his or her license and its effect on employment and transportation prior to committing a drug offense. Accordingly, the statutes bore a rational relationship to the state's legitimate interest in deterrence, the punishment of drug offenders, and highway safety. Moreover, the court failed to see how the punishment prescribed by the statute or the punishment actually imposed was so greatly disproportionate to the offense as to the shock the sense of justice of the community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and driving under license suspension. Appellant's vehicle and license plates were seized pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.38(B)(1). The charges were dismissed, and appellant sought an order directing that her vehicle be released from impoundment and that such release be without cost. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, appellant contended that the trial court erred in failing to order the release of the automobile. The court held that: (1) the trial court was required to enter an order for the release or return of appellant's vehicle once the charges against her were dismissed; (2) appellant should not be required to pay storage and impound expenses in order to obtain the release of her vehicle; (3) the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4507.38(D)(1)(c) at the time of the proceedings against appellant required unequivocally that the automobile be released once the charges were dismissed; and (4) because the vehicle was in the hands of a third party towing company, the recovery of expenses would be a matter of contract law between the State and the company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher instructed the student to close some windows, and one shattered, injuring the student's wrist.

The student appealed, contending that the trial court's holding that &sect; 2744.04(A), which provided the statute of limitations with respect to political subdivisions, was not tolled by a minority was unconstitutional. The court stated that it had previously held that: (1) &sect; 2744.04(A) was the applicable statute of limitations for personal injury actions brought against a political subdivision; (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16, which was the tolling statute, did not operate to toll the running of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04(A); and (3) &sect; 2744.04(A) was not unconstitutional as applied to minors because the constitution only protected access to the courts for claims recognized at common law and the right to bring suit against a political subdivision was statutorily created.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed from the Akron Municipal Court, Summit County (Ohio), judgment finding the knife provision in Akron, Ohio, Codified Ordinance 137.02(A) unconstitutional on its face and granting defendant's motion to dismiss the charge against him. Defendant contended that the knife provision unreasonably impinged upon his constitutional right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was the subject of a traffic stop, he had a decorative knife on the floor of his car. The knife was inside a case but not concealed. The blade exceeded two and one-half inches in length. He was charged with carrying an oversize knife in violation of city ordinance. His motion to dismiss was granted. The knife ordinance was held unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court affirmed the unconstitutionality but on another basis, limiting review to the language that: No person shall carry on or about his person a knife having a blade two and one-half inches in length or longer. This provision was not unconstitutionally vague and, as it did not implicate any First Amendment rights, the overbreadth doctrine did not apply. But because the city had criminalized so much inherently innocent, harmless, and useful conduct, the knife provision was unreasonable in its scope. It clearly prohibited a substantial amount of inherently innocent activity without any element of criminal intent or a sufficient number of exceptions to reasonably define its scope. The knife provision was therefore an unreasonable exercise of the police power and was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding the knife provision of the city ordinance unconstitutional was affirmed. It was not vague and it did not implicate the overbreadth doctrine. But it criminalized a substantial amount of innocent conduct and such a prohibition had no rational connection to protecting the public from the violent use of knives, so it was an unreasonable exercise of the police power in violation of substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allen County (Ohio), which dismissed his petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21. Petitioner had pleaded guilty to an amended indictment of grand theft with a prior offense of violence specification. The appellant did not directly appeal his final judgment of conviction pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 4(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner contended that the trial court unconstitutionally applied Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.143, which permitted a trial court to impose an indefinite term of incarceration pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.11(B)(6) or (7) where an accused had been convicted of a prior offense of violence. The court held that petitioner's constitutional challenge was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court noted that the Supreme Court of Ohio had held that constitutional issues could not be considered in postconviction proceedings under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21 where they had already been or could have been fully litigated by the prisoner before his judgment of conviction or on direct appeal from that judgment. The court held that petitioner's contention that imposing an additional penalty based on a previous conviction was an ex post facto law could have been raised on direct appeal; thus, he was now precluded from raising the issue in a petition for post conviction relief. Petitioner's failure to raise his assertion that the indictment was defective in his petition for postconviction relief served as a waiver of the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the indictment violated the constitutional protection against double jeopardy because both the criminal nonsupport charge and the findings of contempt by a domestic relations court were based upon his failure to provide support for his daughter. The court disagreed finding that the record indicated that both of the judgment entries sentencing the father for contempt contained purge clauses, which would have allowed him to avoid imprisonment simply by complying with the support order issued by the domestic relations court. The court concluded that the contempt proceedings brought by the Child Support Enforcement Agency against the father were therefore civil and not criminal in nature. Therefore, the court concluded that the constitutional protection against double jeopardy did not prohibit the state from prosecuting the father for criminal nonsupport.

The court agreed that the statute imposed such liability, but held that it was compelled to follow the Ohio Supreme Court's ruling that the operation of swimming pools was subject to sovereign immunity. The court held that there was therefore no genuine issue of material fact and that summary judgment in the City's favor was proper. The court also held that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marshal was appointed, and he was required to establish residency within the village under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.15. The marshal had a residence in a city and maintained a secondary residence in the village. The trial court determined that the marshal was not precluded from maintaining the second residence and that the only method by which he could have been removed from office was through the procedures articulated under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.171. The court affirmed, holding the trial court's conclusions were supported by the evidence. The court held that a person had only one domicile but that a person could have more than one residence. Thus, there was sufficient evidence that the marshal was a resident of the village and a city and satisfied the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.15. The court also held that the marshal was not required to be an elector under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 737.171. Further, the court found the marshal was not required to be on call 24 hours a day which necessitated his presence in the village at all times. The court denied the marshal's cross-appeal because he moved from the village and forfeited his position.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the Maumee Municipal Court (Ohio), which granted defendant's motion to suppress following his arrest on charges of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The trial court held that a township police officer who also had been sworn in as a township constable pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 509.05 did not have extra-territorial jurisdiction to stop and arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of the irregular township boundary lines, the officer was a half-mile inside an adjacent township when he observed and stopped defendant. On appeal, the court noted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.03(E)(2) extended a constable's authority to make an arrest to locations outside his township and provided in part that a township constable could arrest and detain, until a warrant can be obtained, any person found violating Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 on the portion of any street or highway that was located immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the unincorporated territory of the township. The court found that the location of the arrest was not immediately adjacent to the officer's township and held that the officer had no authority to make the arrest. The court rejected an argument that the more general Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 509.05 extended a constable's jurisdiction. The court also held that the exclusionary rule applied when the arrest was unlawful because all of the relevant acts took place outside the officer's territorial jurisdiction, so that there was a seizure in violation of defendant's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that suppressed the State's evidence. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it permitted the State to present evidence of other acts independent of the crime for which defendant was on trial, which acts indicated that defendant committed a crime wholly independent of the offense for which he was on trial. Defendant alleged that said evidence was untimely, immaterial, and inadmissible under Ohio R. Evid. 608(B), 404(A), 404(B), and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59, thereby violating defendant's right of due process and confrontation under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 16. The court stated that it was not convinced that the trial court's admission of an officer's hearsay testimony as to what defendant's stepdaughter reported to an investigating officer was harmless error, or that the other admissible evidence, standing alone, constituted overwhelming proof of guilt. Thus, the court could not say with certainty that defendant would have been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, based solely upon the unsupported and vague testimony of a victim/witness, absent the introduction of the improperly admitted hearsay testimony. Based upon its ruling, the court found defendant's argument about his sentence to be moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the venue, the admission of and the sufficiency of evidence, the jury charge, prosecutorial misconduct, effectiveness of counsel, the death and solitary confinement sentences, two homicide convictions for one death, and the constitutionality of the Ohio death penalty. The court affirmed except for the solitary confinement. The trial delay and extensive voir dire abated the effect of pretrial publicity. The court was not persuaded that identifications were unreliable. The evidence of the capital specification of attempted rape was sufficient based on the strength of testimony and the finding of the victim completely nude. The admission of exhibits was proper. The prosecutor's comment on defendant's unsworn statement was not misconduct. The introduction of nonstatutory aggravating circumstances was harmless error. The jury instructions were accurate, or any error was waived. There was no showing of prejudice from ineffectiveness of counsel. The two homicide convictions for allied offenses were proper because defendant received only one death sentence. Regardless of the brutality of defendant's crimes, the solitary confinement sentence was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested and charged with assault, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.13(A), resisting arrest, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.33, and disorderly conduct, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2917.11. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence of his conduct after he was stopped by the police. The trial court denied his motion and the trial court's jury found defendant guilty of assault. The court found that the officer's request that defendant remain in the car for a brief investigatory stop was reasonable and did not violate his U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. The court held that even if the initial stop and detention had been unlawful, the exclusionary rule would not have applied to exclude evidence of defendant's conduct after the stop.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the landowner gave it an option on his property, a company inquired about building a bank there. The board of zoning appeals determined that the property was zoned as an office district and a bank would violate the intent of the planning commission. Thereafter, the village council passed an ordinance sustaining the determination that a bank was not a permitted use in an office district. Without seeking a use variance or taking an administrative appeal, the landowner filed an action for declaratory relief that a bank could be built in an office district under the village zoning code. The common pleas court ruled that a bank was financial office and, thus was a permitted use. The village appealed. In reversing, the appellate court ruled that the common pleas court lacked original subject matter jurisdiction to consider the landowner's action absent a constitutional challenge. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2506, the landowner was required to exhaust his administrative remedies by a direct appeal from the village's decision. Moreover, his argument that he lacked standing to pursue an administrative appeal meant that he also lacked standing for a declaratory action.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04(A). Affirming, the court found that that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 did not modify the statute of limitations set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.04(A) so as to toll the statute of limitations for minors because &sect; 2744.04(A) was not identified in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while under the influence after a police officer observed defendant driving erratically and turning left through a red light. The officer testified that, after he had pulled over defendant's car, he noticed a moderate to strong odor of alcohol on defendant, that defendant's eyes were watery and bloodshot, and that defendant's speech was slurred. At the police station, defendant was given his Miranda rights and another officer administered a blood alcohol content (BAC) verifier test and three physical sobriety tests. Defendant blew a .097 on the BAC test and failed two of the sobriety tests. All tests were recorded on videotape. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the BAC test result without eliciting testimony explaining the test result when the charge of operating under the influence was tried alone. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the results of the chemical test without expert testimony to explain it. The prosecution did not introduce the test results to prove that defendant was under the influence; rather, it introduced the evidence to prove that defendant had consumed alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated. Defendant was driving a car owned by his company. Defendant took a breath test which resulted in a finding of intoxication. Defendant's drivers' license was suspended for one year pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. Defendant filed a motion in the criminal case to dismiss the suspension, an appeal of the suspension, and a motion to stay the suspension pending appeal. The company filed a motion for return of the car, which had been impounded. The trial court denied the motions and dismissed the appeal. Defendant and the company appealed. The court held that defendant had a property interest in his license and was entitled to due process on the suspension. The court held that the opportunity to appeal after the suspension was adequate due process. Section 4511.191(H)(1)'s prohibition on municipal courts and courts of common pleas from granting stays of the suspensions did not violate due process because appellate courts had the authority to issue a stay. It was error to dismiss the appeal because it was not filed under a separate civil cause number. The seizure of the car did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance shifted all the funding of the city's present recreation system from the general public to the developers and purchasers of new construction. Thus, it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. The court held that by requiring only new construction purchasers to shoulder the burden of the recreation program, the charges imposed could not be said to equal the cost of the service as a result of the development.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State inspectors investigated defendant's property and found household garbage, commercial garbage, and demolition debris. The inspectors made videotapes of their visit, which were later shown to the jury out of the presence of the trial judge, with the audio portions played over defendant's objection. Defendant contended that the statutory definition was vague and overbroad because the terms &quot;unwanted,&quot; &quot;garbage,&quot; and &quot;debris&quot; were undefined. The court held that the statute was valid because it gave warning to the ordinary citizen of what was required, precluded arbitrary and capricious enforcement; and ensured that constitutionally protected rights were not unduly impinged. However, the court reversed the conviction and held that the admission of the audio portions of the videotaped evidence constituted prejudicial error because several statements either exceeded the scope of a present sense impression, were irrelevant to the charges pending against defendant, or had more prejudicial impact than probative value. The court ruled that the statements should have been excluded and that the trial court's curative instruction was insufficient to remedy the error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that he did not have a full understanding of the sentencing consequences of his plea and that his decision to enter the guilty pleas was induced by his expectation of a four and one-half year maximum sentence. The trial court questioned defendant at length as to whether he was aware of his right to have a trial, whether he was satisfied with his legal representation and as to the consequences of his guilty pleas. When the trial court asked defendant if he understood that he could be subject to the indeterminate sentences he said that he did. Thus, the court found that defendant was informed of his constitutional rights and that he knowingly and voluntarily entered his guilty pleas. Defendant also asserted that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because he was wrongfully advised of the maximum sentences he faced and his attorney failed to move the trial court to withdraw his guilty pleas upon discovery of the possibility of indeterminate sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property abutted certain property owned by a trust, which was administered by the bank. The corporation, which apparently had an option to buy the trust property, filed and withdrew an application with the township's Zoning Commission to change the zoning classification of the trust property. The bank subsequently filed two similar applications. The bank's first application was deemed null and void, but the bank's second application was approved. The owner filed an administrative appeal and a civil action challenging the decision, and both actions were consolidated. On appeal, the court held that appellees were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law under Ohio R. Civ. P. 56 because the owner failed to raise any issues of material fact. Even if a Board member had a conflict of interest under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 102.03, the proper remedy was to notify the Ethics Commission. The court found no violation of the Ohio Sunshine Law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 121.22 or the public records law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 149.43.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative child requested to disinter the body of the decedent for the purpose of conducting a deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, test. The probate court entered a judgment finding that the putative child was attempting to bring a parentage action in the probate court and held that it lacked jurisdiction over such an action. On appeal, the court agreed because a probate court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to determine a legal father-child relationship in an action commenced against the estate of the father after his death. The court concluded that, although not designated as such, the putative child asked the probate court to determine his parentage under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Chapter 3111, the only method available in Ohio for establishing a legal father-child relationship for inheritance purposes. Therefore, under well-settled law, the probate court properly found that it lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to determine the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer and appellee employee sought review of judgments by the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that granted employer's summary judgment motion to dismiss employee's wrongful discharge claim, that denied employee's motion for prejudgment interest, that denied employer's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and that reduced the jury's punitive damage award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employee was fired by employer when an audit of his hours on the road as a truck driver for the employer revealed that he had exceeded the amount permitted by Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4901:2-5-02(A). The employee, who claimed the employer told him to exceed the hours, brought a wrongful discharge action against the employer. The jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages to the employee. The trial court reduced the punitive damage award, denied the employer's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial, and denied the employee's request for prejudgment interest. The court affirmed all rulings except the punitive damage reduction by the trial court. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the employer's liability for emotional distress and any inconsistencies in the jury's findings were waived by the employer. The court also held that the wrongful discharge against public policy claim was properly dismissed because &sect; 4901:2-5-02(A) was not a &quot;sufficiently clear public policy&quot; prohibiting the discharge of an employee. Finally, the there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying prejudgment interest under &sect; 1343.03(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the wrongful discharge in violation of public policy claim by summary judgment to the employer, the denial of the motion for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict brought by the employer, and the denial of prejudgment interest to the employee. The court reversed the trial court's reduction of punitive damages for the employee and reinstated the punitive damage award by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bar sought review of a decision from the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which upheld a decision by appellee liquor control commission citing the bar for permitting gaming or wagering on a game of skill. The bar contended that the trial court erred in failing to rule that the entry and search of the bar by the commission's investigators was unlawful and in finding that the commission's decision was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission's officer entered the bar behind an unidentified woman. When he sat at the bar, he noticed two poker machines. He was ultimately asked to leave because he did not have a membership card. After identifying themselves in their official capacity two officers were admitted and cited the bar for permitting gaming or wagering on a game of skill on electronic video machine. The trial court affirmed the commission's decision finding a wagering violation. In reversing on appeal, the court held that: (1) there were no allegations of fact to support any of the recognized exceptions to the prohibition against warrantless searches, in particular the plain view doctrine, where there was a locked door with a buzzer that denied access to the bar to non-members and the commission's officer entered behind an unidentified woman and there was nothing in plain view until the officer actually passed through the door; (2) thus, the search was unlawful and all evidence obtained pursuant to the search was inadmissible; and (3) where the search was unconstitutional, the court declined to rule upon whether the bar did more than merely possess the gambling devices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision from the trial court, which affirmed the commission's citation of the bar for violating the commission's gaming regulation. The court remanded the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the car manufacturer's motion for directed verdict, granted the driver a separate trial, suppressed evidence, granted a protective order, awarded attorney fees, and dismissed the seatbelt manufacturer. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An accident victim was injured when an individual struck his vehicle from behind. In a second accident, the driver struck another vehicle driven by the accident victim. The accident victim and his wife alleged that the seat belt mechanism in the vehicle involved in the first accident was defective. The trial court ultimately granted the car manufacturer's motion for a directed verdict. On appeal, the court held that: 1) because the claim against the driver was for negligence arising out of a separate accident, the trial court did not err by granting the driver's motion for severance; 2) the trial court did not err by granting a protective order regarding evidence of fuel system integrity crash tests; 3) The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the automobile manufacturer's motion to suppress certain evidence because the sanction was appropriate to the seriousness of a discovery abuse; 4) the accident victim and his wife could not prove the essential elements of a design defect products liability case; and 5) even though the trial court erred in applying a two year limitations period to the seat belt manufacturer, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an employer and its principal, appealed a settlement agreement entered into with plaintiff employee in the employee's action for breach of contract and fraud against defendants. The settlement was reduced to a judgment by the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's case was based on defendants' breach of an oral contract that the employer would provide the employee with health care coverage. A settlement was reached after it was shown that defendants fabricated evidence against the employee in support of their counterclaim that the employee had embezzled money from the employer. The court affirmed the settlement judgment, holding that (1) the employee's claim was not preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act because the trial court had concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts to award benefits due under the terms of the employee's benefit plan, and the trial court did not apply Ohio law in deciding the case; (2) defendants were not entitled to relief under Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B) because defendants did not demonstrate a meritorious defense to the settlement and there was no showing that enforcement of the settlement would be unjust; (3) there was no manifest miscarriage of justice in the case that would require application of the plain error doctrine; and (4) the trial court properly enforced the judgment through a contempt proceeding when defendants failed to make an initial settlement payment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment entered as a result of the settlement agreement between the employee and defendants.</SPAN></P>
