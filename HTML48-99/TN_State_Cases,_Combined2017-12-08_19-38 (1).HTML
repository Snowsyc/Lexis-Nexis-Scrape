<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee, at Davidson, upheld defendant's convictions for armed robbery and assault and battery. Defendant appealed the judgment sentencing him for armed robbery, which enhanced the sentenced to life imprisonment following a jury verdict that he was a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A hearing on defendant's habitual criminality charge occurred after the jury had returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of armed robbery. The State called a deputy clerk of the trial court and introduced into evidence certified copies of convictions of a person bearing the same name as defendant for four previous felonies, which were the same offenses alleged in the third count of the indictment. None of the minute entries, which were filed as an exhibit, recited the date of the offense for which defendant was convicted. The clerk testified that none of the indictments showed the date of the offenses. However, the clerk was permitted to read from the official arrest warrants, which established that each of the four offenses occurred on different dates. Defendant objected to the testimony as hearsay. The appellate court held that the information adduced by the State was admissible. On appeal, the court held that the dates of the offenses shown on the warrants were sufficiently reliable to justify their admission entries in the official record as evidence of a date of an earlier offense for which defendant had been convicted. Therefore, the court upheld defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment but remanded the case to the trial court for the purpose of fixing a sentence on the assault and battery conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Davidson Criminal Court (Tennessee), which convicted him of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and which imposed an enhanced sentence under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403 based on defendant's prior DUI conviction. The trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the sentence enhancement in the indictment, ruling that it was an unauthorized collateral attack on the prior conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's sentence as a second DUI offender was upheld by the appellate court. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that defendant's first conviction in a general sessions court was facially valid, presumably regular and final, and could not be attacked in the second proceeding. The court rejected the claim that the first judgment, consisting of the warrant entering the conviction, did not show a valid waiver of counsel because it was not entered by a court of record, ruling that the waiver properly appeared on the warrant. Defendant's only means to attack the judgment was a post-conviction petition and, although defendant was not in custody, he could file a petition because he still suffered under a direct or concomitant disability due to the conviction's penalty enhancement effect. The court noted that, if defendant proved in a post-conviction action that his waiver of counsel in the first proceeding was invalid, he would also be entitled to relief from the sentence in the second offense. The court concluded that a petition could not be filed in the convicting court as generally required because a general sessions court could not hold an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's decision upholding the trial court's judgment and declined to stay the enhanced sentence imposed on defendant, noting that defendant was entitled to take all steps necessary to challenge his convictions in a post-conviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court did not pass on the quo warranto proceeding to determine the reasonableness of the annexation ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence by the Shelby County Criminal Court (Tennessee). He was convicted of first degree murder in the perpetration of a robbery and was sentenced to death based upon three aggravating circumstances: He was previously convicted of felonies involving the use or threat of violence to a person; the murder was committed while he was engaged in committing robbery; and a mass murder aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, rejecting his multiple challenges to the verdict. The court found that defendant's confession that he robbed and killed the victim was admissible. The trial court made express findings of fact, all contrary to defendant's contentions, and those findings had the weight of a jury verdict and included material evidence to support the trial court's findings. Defendant was not entitled to a change of venue for newspaper coverage of his prior murder trial. The jurors selected who had any knowledge of the publicity about the prior murder trial all testified that they could decide the case entirely on the evidence presented in the current case without reference to any prior publicity. The admission of a photograph of the victim had little probative value but was not prejudicial to defendant. The testimony of an accomplice that defendant failed to complete two robberies immediately prior to the killing of the victim was relevant to the issue of whether the killing was accidental or intentional. The mass murder specification should not have been applied to defendant but the other two aggravating circumstances supported the death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judge was found guilty of committing a felony and alleged to be disqualified to hold the office of judge due to the suspension of his law license. The judge challenged the jurisdiction of the lower court to take any steps leading to his removal or impeachment on the ground that such proceedings were constitutionally vested exclusively in the legislature. The court agreed that the legislature could not delegate the power to remove a judge to the executive or the judicial branches of government, and there was no delegation of that power. However, the judge was convicted of practicing fraud upon an office repeatedly, over a period of years and of realizing personal profit as a direct result of those fraudulent and illegal acts. The court found that he committed acts that sought to obstruct justice and lied to the federal grand jury. Consequently, he failed to observe the highest standards of conduct that necessary to preserve the integrity and independence of the judiciary. The court recommended that the judge be removed from office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial judge granted defendant's motion for a new sentencing hearing for error in advising that jury that the first jury had imposed the death penalty. The State relied upon two aggravating circumstances pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2-203(i)(2), (i)(6): previous conviction of one or more felonies that involved the use or threat of violence to the person and commission of the murder to avoid, prevent, or interfere with the prosecution of defendant for another offense. The third jury's verdict expressly found that defendant had previously been convicted of murder in the second degree and aggravated assault constituting the proscribed aggravating circumstance described in &sect; 39-2-203(i)(2). No mention was made of the other aggravating circumstance. The court held that the jury's failure to find that the State had not proven the second aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt did not affect the sentence of death. The court found that the trial court correctly excluded proffered testimony of a witness because it was only relevant to the issue of guilt or innocence and not relevant as essential background information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">McKenzie, Tenn., Code &amp; 2-231 limited the issuance of permits for the sale of beer to regularly established grocery stores. There were two criteria for qualification as such a store: an applicant had to derive a majority of its gross sales from the retail sale of groceries and the applicant had to have been in such business for at least 12 months. The applicant appealed the denial of its permit application. The trial court upheld the denial, and the court affirmed. The court noted that, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-5-108(a)(1), a municipality had extremely broad power and discretion in the regulation of and control over the sale of beer within the municipality's limits, provided that they complied with a fundamental principle of fairness and did not exercise their power in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner. The court concluded that the ordinance in this case was reasonably related to the promotion of public safety and to the reduction of law enforcement expense. Further, the applicant failed to carry his burden of showing that the ordinance was not reasonably related to those protectable interests or that it was arbitrary or oppressive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Tenn.

Because medical malpractice victims were not a suspect class, the court held that the contiguous state limitation was reviewed under the rational basis test. The court also noted that in a medical malpractice action, a plaintiff was required show that defendant failed to act with ordinary and reasonable care when compared to the customs or practices of physicians from a particular geographic region. The court found that it was conceivable that the risk of inaccurate assessment of defendant's conduct in relation to customs or practices in a similar community were reduced if the expert was from Tennessee or a contiguous state. The possible reduction in inaccurate expert testimony was reasonably related to the legitimate state interest in ensuring fair trials. Accordingly, the statute was upheld as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, state department of revenue and its commissioner, sought review of a judgment from the Chancery Court of Marion County (Tennessee), which applied the Financial Records Privacy Act (FRPA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 45-10-101, et seq., to limit the records that respondent bank had to produce in response to the commissioner's investigative summons regarding intervenor bank customer and to tax the commissioner with the costs of production.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner petitioned the chancery court to enforce his investigative summons, which sought records from the bank regarding its customer, the subject of an ongoing investigation. The bank challenged the scope of the summons under the FRPA. The chancery court agreed with the bank, ordered the commissioner to pay the reasonable expense of production, and restricted the summons to bank accounts and records for which the customer had signatory authority or on which his name appeared. The commissioner argued on appeal that the chancery court erred and incorrectly dismissed his petition for contempt. The court held that the state legislature had effectively amended, by implication, the Tax Enforcement Procedures Act (TEPA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-1-14-1, et seq., when it passed the FRPA because the FRPA's procedures for obtaining records from a bank were more exacting and restrictive. The court held that the chancery court properly narrowed the scope of the commissioner's summons and taxed him with costs under the FRPA and that his petition for contempt was properly dismissed because the bank and the customer were within their rights to challenge the summons under the FRPA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the chancery court to limit the records to be produced by the bank in response to the commissioner's summons and to tax the commissioner with the reasonable cost of producing the records. The court held that the chancery court properly dismissed the commissioner's petition for contempt and taxed the costs of appeal to the commissioner.

At trial, defendant's testimony revealed that the homicide was the result of careful and deliberate planning after having warned his estranged wife and her family of his intentions. The aggravating circumstance relied on the prosecution and found by the jury to warrant the death penalty was that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of mind. On appeal, defendant contended that the evidence in support of the aggravating circumstance was not sufficient to outweigh the mitigating circumstances upon which he relied. The court found that defendant's deliberate execution of his wife was corroborated by a number of eyewitnesses who saw or heard all or part of the shots being fired. The court found that the wife or her manager had twice called the police to try to prevent the unprovoked homicide. The court also found that the wife was terrified by defendant's conduct and threats before he murdered her.

The court rejected this claim and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court found that &sect; 29-28-103 was similar to the statutes of repose applicable to medical malpractice actions and to actions involving persons engaged in the construction or improvement of real property. The court further found that the injured parties presented almost identical state and federal constitutional issues as those issues that were rejected in cases dealing with these two other statutes. The court held that it agreed with the analyses in those other cases and upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 29-28-103 on the same grounds. The court further held that &sect; 29-28-103 was rationally related to the stated purposes for its enactment, that it reasonably furthered those purposes, and that it represented a reasonable balancing of the conflicting interests and concerns with which the legislature had to deal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commissioner assessed general corporate excise taxes in 1982 against the banks, who paid under protest, and with interest earned on the federal obligations. The court affirmed the contested decree and remanded the action to continue the proceedings pursuant to law. Costs were taxed against the commissioner. The court held that a controlling, apposite precedent mandated its decision in this action. The court found that 1982 tax was calculated based on the definition of net earnings in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-2704, which was held discriminatory in the apposite precedent on the use of the definition to calculate a local bank tax. The court rejected as inapposite the precedent asserted by the commissioner, which employed a formula that would have excluded the interest that accrued on the federal obligations to reduce the banks' recovery. The court distinguished the commissioner's inapposite precedent because it concerned a state's exemption of federal obligations, not a discrimination issue, and it involved a property tax instead of a non-property tax. The court held that allowing the banks to recover the 1982 taxes did not involve a retroactive application of the apposite precedent.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to death for the murder and received 125 years imprisonment for the robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court held that there was no error in the failure to instruct the jury on lesser-included homicide offenses because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt on the greater offense. There was no merit in the contention that the jury had started deliberations prematurely just because they asked for information and the trial court had not unfairly restricted voir dire of the jury. Questionable evidence of prior acts was admitted but the error, if any, was harmless. There was no error in a failure to compel the prosecution to disclose a witness's criminal record, and the trial court had not erred when it refused to sever a co-defendant whose confession provided interlocking evidence of the time, location, and plan of the crime. The jury was properly instructed on aggravating and mitigating circumstances and on unanimity, and there was no error in restrictions on philosophical arguments against the death penalty, which the court refused to consider.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was found dead in a field, the vagina of the victim having been torn by a foreign object. Following defendant's arrest in Alabama for another crime, Tennessee authorities went to Alabama and obtained a confession. During defendant's trial for the victim's rape and murder, defendant filed: (1) a motion to suppress the confession; (2) a motion for mistrial because of surprising testimony from the State's pathologist; and (3) a motion for expert fees under &sect; 40-14-207(b). Following the denial of the motions and defendant's conviction, review was sought. In rejecting defendant's claim that the right to counsel was misunderstood during the confession, the court held the credibility issues had been resolved against defendant. The court also rejected defendant's claim of surprise because the State had not violated its disclosure duty. Furthermore, court held the pathologist's testimony had been non-prejudicial because the testimony was not the only evidence that the victim had been alive at the time of penetration. Finally, in light of other psychiatric reports and the trial court's own observations, the court held defendant had not been entitled to expert fees.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there were six factors to be considered in determining whether preprinted advertising supplements were a component part of a newspaper to be exempted from the tax: ownership, preparation, regular feature, privity of contract, &quot;supplement to&quot; followed by &quot;gang logo,&quot; and distribution. The court determined that the taxpayer's preprinted advertising supplements were not integral parts of the newspapers. The court found that such advertising supplements were not exempt from the use tax. The court held that the selection of subjects for tax exemption was a legislative function, not a judicial function. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's judgment and affirmed the revocation of the license. The court held that the trial court erroneously placed the burden on the beer board of proving the reasonableness and validity of the city's rule regarding the amount of alcohol that could have been sold. The city's ordinance provided that 51 percent of an establishment's sales must have come from food. The court determined that the license holder did not demonstrate that there was no basis in reason for the ordinance. There was nothing in the ordinance to indicate that a licensee's actual noncompliance with the 51 percent rule was to have been excused either by its efforts to make sufficient food items available for purchase or by its efforts to promote its food line. Because the license holder failed to comply with the ordinance and also permitted minors to loiter or congregate about the premises and sold alcohol to minors, the revocation of its on-premises beer permit was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant Secretary of State of Tennessee appealed a declaration from the chancery court (Tennessee), that Lincoln County was divided to a greater extent than was necessary to meet the federal constitutional requirements, and accordingly declaring unconstitutional and void those portions of 1984 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 778, &sect; 2(d), which pertained to the 62nd and 65th Districts, in an action brought by plaintiff officials of two counties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officials in effect admitted that at least one county of the four counties comprising the two districts was required to be divided in order to comply with federal constitutional principles, but insisted that the legislature did not make a good faith effort to draw the lines, with the result that the division of two counties violated the provisions of Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 5. On appeal of the trial court's decision finding the portions of the statute unconstitutional, the court held that the proof was insufficient to warrant the action taken below. The officials offered no evidence to demonstrate bad faith by the General Assembly or to establish deliberate gerrymandering. The two districts involved were but two out of 99 districts, and the two counties which were divided under the statute were but two of 29 counties which were so divided. The general plan had been held to meet federal constitutional standards and on its face it met the guidelines set forth by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court which found portions of the statute unconstitutional, and dismissed the suit at the cost of the officials. The court ordered the cause remanded to the trial court for collection of costs accrued there and for any further orders which might be necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue on appeal was whether a privilege tax on the occupancy of hotel and motel rooms violated the free exercise or establishment clauses of the First Amendment or the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when applied to a church which rented motel rooms solely for religious worship and instruction. Affirming, the court held that the privilege tax imposed was not a tax on tithes and offerings. It was a tax upon the secular activity of occupying a hotel or motel room. Because it had not limited any religious practice, the court concluded that the free exercise rights of the church had not been violated. The court found that that the privilege tax neither advanced nor inhibited religion. The tax was imposed upon the occupancy of space in a hotel or motel and not upon any religious function. Since the religious use of the rooms was irrelevant to the imposition of the tax, and since the operator was responsible for remitting the tax, there was no risk of excessive government entanglement. The tax did not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it applied uniformly to all parties who chose to make use of hotel or motel rooms.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received consecutive life sentences for armed robbery and rape. In a separate hearing, the jury returned a verdict of death on the murder conviction. On appeal, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial court's exclusion of a potential juror for cause on the State's motion, the admission of evidence, the State's argument in both the convicting and sentencing phases of the trial, and the court's instructions to the jury. Defendant also argued that the sentencing provision of the Tennessee Death Penalty Act (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, finding no reversible error. The court held, among other things, that the evidence, although circumstantial, was legally sufficient to sustain the convictions. Also, the court found no prejudicial error in the admission of evidence. Finally, the Act did not unconstitutionally penalize defendant's exercise of his right to a jury trial because defendant was subject to the risk of receiving a death penalty whether he pled guilty or chose a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

He expressly reserved his right to appeal the constitutionality of the Act. Defendant asserted that the Act was unconstitutionally vague. Affirming and remanding, the court held that the Act was constitutional. The court held that the vagueness or lack of vagueness of the order had no effect upon the vagueness or lack of vagueness of the Act. Moreover, the fact that the Act made it optional whether or not a habitual offender applied for reinstatement had no effect whatever on the clear mandate of the Act that the suspension of driving privileges would remain in effect until a reinstatement petition was filed and approved.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Bradford Act, 1984 Tenn. Priv. Acts 240, and the Gibson Act, 1984 Tenn. Priv. Acts 241, levied property tax increases in the school districts (districts). However, &sect; 2 of the Bradford Act provided that the acts would become only upon the approval of the majority of voters in the effected school district. &sect; 3 of the Gibson Act contained a similar provision. Also, both statutes contained severability clauses. The trustee for one district refused to effect a tax increase without a referendum. In an action for a declaratory judgment upholding the tax increase and rendering the referendum requirement null and void by the districts, the trial court found that the Bradford and Gibson Acts were constitutional. On review, the court reversed and remanded. Because there was no express provision of the Tennessee Constitution permitting the legislature to delegate its taxing power to voters of a special school district and no sanction by immemorial usage of such a delegation of the taxing power, the legislation in question was unconstitutional. However, the doctrine of elision applied and the legislation could be given effect without regard to the unconstitutional sections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant revenue commissioner appealed a judgment of the Shelby Chancery Court (Tennessee), which granted plaintiff taxpayer recovery of certain sales taxes that it paid under protest. The commissioner claimed that the repairs done by the taxpayer for its customers constituted taxable repair services under the sales and use tax law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-6-101 et seq., and that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause or &sect; 67-6-313.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the taxpayer's action to recover sales taxes, the trial court ruled that the units repaired by the taxpayer were exempt from taxation. In the commissioner's appeal, the court reversed the judgment below, ruling that exemptions had to appear clearly in the statutory language and that they were construed against the taxpayer. There was no exemption or any degree of repair in &sect; 67-6-102(13)(F)(iv). Under the statute, all repairs on any tangible property were taxable. The court also rejected the taxpayer's argument that the statute violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, agreeing with the commissioner that the taxable event was the performance of repair services within the state. The tax on that service imposed under &sect; 67-6-102(13)(F)(iv) was a permissible exercise of the state's taxing power under the Commerce Clause and &sect; 67-6-313. The four-part test focused on the sufficiency of the nexus between the state and the activity and the tax's consequences on interstate commerce. The court ruled that the imposition of sales taxes on services performed within the state on products later placed into interstate commerce did not violate the Constitution or &sect; 67-6-313.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the constitutionality of Ordinance 56-1981-82, &sect; 307.4, finding that it was not vague or overbroad. The vehicle in question was an abandoned vehicle as defined in Clarksville, Tenn., Ordinance 56-1981-32, &sect; 201.2. The words of Clarksville, Tenn., Ordinance 56-1981-82, &sect; 307.4 were sufficiently precise to put the owner on reasonable notice concerning the conduct which was prohibited, and the words set out sufficiently distinct boundaries for the courts to fairly administer the law. The court held that the owner did not have standing to raise the issue of the vagueness and overbreadth of Ordinance 56-1981-82, &sect; 307.4 as applied to other situations. Nor did the city attempt to deny the owner of the economically viable use of his property without just compensation, as the law of eminent domain did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney was appointed by the judge of the Circuit Court of Coffee County to represent an indigent defendant charged with armed robbery and felony murder, and he also performed services on appeal. The appointing judge agreed that the 500 dollar fee was inadequate, but denied the attorney's request for additional fees for lack of authority to exceed the statutory maximum. The court noted that a party dissatisfied with a trial court order awarding compensation could appeal as of right, and held that a chancery court in another county did not have jurisdiction of an independent action seeking payment, regardless of the basis for the action. Likewise, no independent cause of action against the State of Tennessee could be pursued by a lawyer dissatisfied with the award of a fee for representing indigent defendants in the appellate courts. In the criminal cases such a claim had to be timely filed wherein the services were rendered. Review of an award of the Court of Criminal Appeals had to be sought pursuant to Tenn. R.

On appeal, the bank and the county government argued that mandamus was an inappropriate remedy because a dispute existed as to whether the alley was public or private. While conceding that mandamus was inappropriate to ascertain or adjust doubtful claims, the court affirmed the holding below because the right asserted by the owner was not doubtful. Not only was the police department not vested with discretion to determine whether a particular alley was public, but the county's argument that it was not public did not render the right doubtful so as to prevent the remedy of mandamus. Further, the facts and circumstances implied an intent to offer the alley for public use, the reasonable inference to be drawn from the public use of the alley following its dedication was that it was public, the city adopted an official street and alley acceptance and maintenance map which showed the alley as a public alley, and no taxes were assessed on the alley.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a earlier trial, defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and a death sentence was imposed for the killing of the victim, his ex-wife.

In the re-sentencing hearing, evidence was introduced which showed that the victim had killed another person, and that defendant was indicted in that killing for first-degree murder and as an accessory before the fact. A jury fixed defendant's sentence at death by electrocution. The jury found that two aggravating circumstances existed and that there were no mitigating circumstances that were sufficiently substantial to outweigh the aggravating circumstances. The court held that: (1) the use of an incident where a loaded gun was found underneath a seat in a truck defendant sat in late at night was proper for impeachment of defendant's character witnesses; and (2) the use of defendant's conviction as an accessory to the earlier murder after his nolo contendere plea could be used for enhancement of punishment in the same manner as a conviction that followed a not guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence was sufficient to convince any rational trier of fact of the guilt of defendants of the murder of the clerks in the perpetration of armed robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. Assuming defendant one did not fire either of the fatal bullets, there was evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he attempted to kill and employed lethal force and there was strong circumstantial evidence that he intended to kill. Therefore, defendant one's death sentence was proper. The court found that the jury instructions were proper. From an examination of the jury instruction as a whole, and the context in which the presumptions were stated, the court concluded that no reasonable juror would interpret the presumption as conclusive or as shifting the burden of persuasion to defendants. However, even if the instructions were erroneous, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court found that investigators or news reporters would not be subject to an indictment under the statute. In addition, none of the indicted spectators asserted that he or she was engaged in any such activity. The statute was also clear that it only prohibited spectators from unlawfully, knowingly, and intentionally being at the exhibition of a cockfight, as a result of which, courts would not sanction prosecution of a farmer who happened upon two animals fighting. The statute was a valid exercise of the police power and did not improperly infringe upon freedom of association, mobility, or any other constitutionally protected right. It was also reasonably related to the legislative purpose of discouraging and prohibiting the cruel practice of animal baiting and fighting.</SPAN></P>

The State sought review of an order from the appellate court, which found a charge constitutionally defective and reduced the offense to aggravated assault.

The court concluded that no reasonable jury could have interpreted the challenged instruction, which stated that the use of a deadly weapon raised a presumption of malice unless rebutted by other facts and circumstances to the contrary, as mandatory or conclusive or as shifting to defendant the burden of persuasion on the element of malice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it overruled his objection to the use of a prior conviction for manslaughter for impeachment purposes. The court ruled that under Fed. R.

Here, the court held that balancing the probative value against the prejudicial effect produced a very close result and the court was unable to say that the trial judge abused his discretion. In addition, defendant argued that the trial judge erred during the sentencing hearing when it allowed the State to introduce police reports of his misdemeanor arrests during the cross examination of a defense expert. The court ruled that although a record of arrests could be admissible in some instances, there was no valid basis for the introduction the arrest reports here because the expert had not based his testimony on the scope of defendant's criminal activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During negotiations with the teachers' union, the board unilaterally decided to cease making insurance premium payments for the teachers. The board also notified the teachers that it would no longer make payroll deductions for dues in the teachers' union. During the litigation, the board held two private meetings with its attorney and its negotiator. At issue was whether the jury's verdict at the trial was advisory only, whether the board's closed meetings violated the Act, and whether the board had negotiated in bad faith. The court held that the attorney-client privilege was waived by the legislature when it passed the Act. However, ethical considerations on the disclosure of confidential client information by attorneys created an exception to the Act for meetings between a public body, its agents, and attorneys regarding current or pending litigation. The trial court erred in taking the verdict from the jury because the verdict was not advisory. However, the issue of the board's good faith negotiation was one of law and the trial court's decision that the board did not negotiate in good faith as to the dues and insurance premiums was correct.</SPAN></P>

The state attorney general intervened, and the trial court held that the statute was not unconstitutional and awarded the $ 10,000 benefit. The parents appealed, and the court noted that the classifications created were covered employees who died with dependents and those who died without dependents. Reviewing the case under the rational basis test, the court found that it was rational and entirely reasonable to make available additional death benefits to the dependents of a deceased worker.

Priv. Acts 568 was a violation of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8 and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 in plaintiff applicant's action challenging the constitutionality of the Private Act, which prohibited the sale of fireworks in the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action was initiated by the applicant challenging the constitutionality of the Private Act. The applicant's application for a license to sell fireworks was previously denied. The conflict between The Private Act and the general law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 68-22-116, was in the fact that the general law allowed pyrotechnics to be sold during certain periods of the year and the Private Act made such sale in the county a misdemeanor throughout the entire year. The trial court held that the Private Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the Private Act was passed before &sect; 68-22-116. Thus, the Private Act was upheld because it conferred special benefits and imposed special burdens on the citizens of one county, when there was no general statute, and when before the Private Act, there was only common law. The court was satisfied that the Private Act related to a matter in respect of which a difference in population could furnish a rational basis for diversity of laws. The likelihood of injury resulting from the use or misuse of fireworks was greater in a thickly populated county than in a county with a small population.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife was awarded a 1/4 interest in the husband's company stock. Because the stock was closely held, the trial court awarded her other property and cash equivalent in value to and in lieu of her 1/4 interest on the husband's stock. Accordingly, the final decree divested the wife of her interest in the stock, reinvesting it in the husband. The wife appealed and, subsequently, filed a motion under Rule 14 contending that the company was sold for a much higher value than was determined by the trial court. The court of appeals granted her motion for determination of facts in regard to the alleged sale of the company. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals that granted the wife's Rule 14 motion. The court found that the rule 14 motion was an attempt to relitigate the issue of value, a purpose outside the scope of the rule. The court held that the court of appeals erred in granting the wife's motion.</SPAN></P>

The court found the trial court did not err when it allowed the introduction of his conviction for first degree murder in another case as an aggravating circumstance in this case. The court also found the lower court did not err when it allowed the introduction of the victim's dental records because he was not denied his right to confrontation even though the dentist who created the records did not appear.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Tennessee General Assembly passed 1982 Tenn. Pub.

Code Ann. &sect; 13-20-205(a)(2). The specified population bracket was for counties having a population of not less than 275,000 nor more than 325,000 persons according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census. Only Hamilton and Knox Counties fell within that provisions. Knox County challenged the provision as a violation of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8. The trial court found the provision unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that where the provisions of an act that was either local, or local in effect, contravened such a general law, however, the provisions of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8, came into play, and there must have been some reasonable basis for the special provision.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contested his conviction and sentencing on numerous grounds. The court affirmed the trial court's conviction and sentencing of defendant. The court held in part that (1) the statement given by defendant to the police officers after his arrest was admissible, as the evidence indicated that he had suffered no material injury in his escape and capture, and the hospital records indicated that he was alert and oriented; and that (2) the lineup identification of defendant was proper, as the fast food restaurant's employees supplied law enforcement officers with an accurate and detailed description of defendant, the lineup was held only a few hours after the crime, and the record indicated that the employees had the opportunity to view defendant inside the lighted restaurant for a relatively long period of time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged and convicted on a charge of murder in the first degree while in the commission of armed robbery for the brutal slaying of a convenience store clerk. The evidence showed that defendant shot the clerk four times to ensure that he was dead. Defendant was sentenced to death by electrocution. Defendant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the verdict and judgment were amply supported by material evidence, and the sentence was in no way arbitrary or disproportionate. The court reasoned that the evidence fully supported the jury's finding of the statutory aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in committing armed robbery. The court concluded that there was nothing unconstitutional or vague about Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(j)(1). The court reasoned that Tennessee did not limit the range of mitigating circumstances, and those referred to in the statute were merely particularized examples of the type of evidence that may be offered by an accused who has been convicted of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the jury's province was precisely that of determining a witness's credibility, and the court would not substitute its judgment on appeal for the jury's judgment. The court concluded that a rational jury could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel was not abridged by the trial court's denying his motion for funds to secure the assistance of an expert in the field of hair analysis. The court held that the State was under no federal constitutional obligation to provide expert pre-trial assistance to an indigent defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from his convictions, defendant contended that the search of his vehicle was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient to support his murder conviction. The court held that the search was constitutional because the officers had an abundance of probable cause to stop defendant's truck; specifically, the detailed information given by the informant was corroborated by the fact that the informant's description of the vehicle and license plate number matched defendant's truck. The evidence was sufficient to support the murder conviction because premeditation was proven by the fact defendant committed the homicide in perpetration of the robbery of the victim. The court reversed defendant's death sentence because the trial court had improperly admitted evidence of defendant's prior convictions that did not involve the use of or threats of violence to any person.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parent and the two minor children had brought a claim for damages based on emotional injuries against the veterinarian and the hospital. They alleged that the veterinarian had willfully inflicted emotional injuries upon them by his outrageous and extreme conduct in threatening that he would do away with their dog if they didn't pay their bill in full. The trial court had granted summary judgment to the veterinarian and the hospital, and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the veterinarian and the hospital. First, the appellate court had erred in adjudicating the issue regarding the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-1234 because that question had not been raised during the trial court proceedings. Next, the court agreed that the conduct complained of was outrageous, extreme, and was not tolerable in a civilized society. Further, there was a genuine issue as to a material fact because the allegations were supported in the record by the parent's affidavit, and the veterinarian denied that he had threatened to do away with the dog.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a judgment of the Knox County Criminal Court (Tennessee), which dismissed the aggravated rape count of an indictment against defendant. The trial court held that the definition of aggravated rape in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-603 was so vague that it violated the due process clause of the state and federal constitutions, Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 and U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant insisted that the aggravated rape statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, arguing that it failed to specify that the proscribed sexual penetration must have been accomplished by force or coercion and against the will of the victim. Defendant argued that it violated due process because it failed to give notice of the prohibited conduct. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case, finding that the statute as applied to defendant was constitutional. The court found that the words of the challenged provision were sufficiently precise to put an individual on notice of prohibited activities. The court noted that the legislature had adopted the common law definition of rape and had used the term &quot;rape&quot; in the aggravated rape statute as it was understood commonly. The court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-603(a)(2) proscribed aggravated rape and incorporated necessarily the definition of rape, being an aggravated form of the same offense. The indictment sufficiently charged defendant with the common law elements of rape by alleging that he had sexual intercourse with a victim by force or coercion and against her will.</SPAN></P>

The trial court accepted the sentence and imposed it defendant. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced by an alias that was used in the indictment because the evidence presented by the State clearly established his guilt. Defendant raised no new legal arguments to show that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2404 was constitutionally infirm. Because felony murder was the only statutory aggravating circumstance supported by the evidence and relied upon by the State, the other sections of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2404(i) should not have been charged to the jury. However, the court found no prejudice because the jurors returned a verdict of felony murder, which was the only aggravating circumstance that the evidence supported. Although the jury did not specifically state the felony that aggravated the murder, it was clear that they intended attempted robbery as that felony. They jurors were familiar with the indictment, which charged defendant with murder during the attempted perpetration of a robbery. The jury considered any diminished capacity of defendant before reaching their verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In affirming defendant's conviction and the death penalty, the court held that abundant probable cause had existed to order defendant's arrest and to arrest defendant without a warrant. There was overwhelming lay and expert testimony to support the jury's rejection of defendant's plea of insanity. The court held that defendant lacked standing to challenge the composition of the grand jury on the basis that women were systematically excluded and further noted that the proffered evidence did not support a finding of the requisite elements of substantial underrepresentation as a result of a systemic exclusion in the grand jury selection process. The extensive voir dire examination selected an impartial jury properly committed to try defendant only on the evidence presented at trial, uninfluenced by any pre-trial publicity or any information imparted during the voir dire. Although the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the State to replay the entirety of defendant's taped interview during closing, the court held that it was a harmless error because the overwhelming evidence convicted defendant, not the replaying of the tape during closing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a state senator, sued defendant state officials and challenged the constitutionality of 1981 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 494. The complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief against enforcement of the Act. On remand, the state officials filed an answer to the complaint, and the case was tried on stipulations. The Chancery Court of Davidson County (Tennessee) held that the statute was not invalid. The state senator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute provided for a per diem allowance for one day before and one day after legislators traveled to out-of-state conferences. The court rejected the state senator's argument that the statute violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 18, 19. The court explained that the constitutional provisions did not proscribe the manner in which the legislation was recalled from the governor's office without the assembly's express direction. The court found no constitutional requirements absent in the entries of the house and senate journals. Although the amended bill was not passed initially by the house, the court said that it was eventually passed, as was clearly set out in the journal. The court explained that the director of legislative administration, apparently on his own judgment, had declined to reimburse legislators for their travel expenses for days immediately before and after conferences. Because a reasonable interpretation of the old statute permitted legislators their expenses for travel to and from meetings concerning state business, the court ruled that it did not provide for an unconstitutional increase in expenses. The court rejected the state senator's other arguments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, retired district attorneys general, appealed a decision from the Chancery Court for Davidson County (Tennessee), which determined they were not entitled to escalation of their retirement benefits under Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retired district attorneys contended that their right to the benefits of the escalator clause contained in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-23-101(d)(3) became absolutely vested on the date of their retirement. They also contended that any discontinuance of their retirement benefits under the escalator clause that was attributable to the 1977 amendment to the compensation statute for active district attorneys constituted an unconstitutional impairment of contract obligation. The court disagreed. It found that the 1977 amendment, codified at Tenn. Code Ann. 8-23-101(d)(4) (1977), rendered the escalator clause ineffective. Under either a contract or vested rights theory, the retired district attorneys were assured a sum equal to the annual salary a retired attorney would have received had he continued in the position from which he retired, pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-618(4). Had they continued in the position from which they retired, they would not be able to claim the benefits of the escalator clause.

The chancellor held that the banks had standing to maintain the action, and he declared the 1982 amendment unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The banks had no standing to bring the claim. The State was not required to accord to every person or corporation outside its borders standing to challenge its revenue laws simply because they claimed some adverse effect from them. The banks were, at most, indirectly affected by the Tennessee statute. The tax was exclusively upon local citizens in the receipt of their private incomes. The banks did not represent any of the taxpayers who had standing and it did not show standing to seek declarative or injunctive relief in their own right or otherwise.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a judge's widow and the administrator of the judge's estate, sued defendant, the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System, for a determination as to the amount of benefits to which the judge was entitled after his retirement. A chancellor dismissed the complaint and denied plaintiffs' subsequent new trial motion. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Tennessee, at Nashville, affirmed the chancellor's decree in part. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the judge took office, his pension benefits, pursuant to the escalator provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-301, were calculated on a basis of the annual salary of an associate justice, and the judge was entitled to any increases that were provided in compensation for active judges. By 1963 Tenn. Pub. Acts 73 (1963 Act), the increase language in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-301 was eliminated. Numerous other amendments were made to the System. The chancellor determined that the judge did not have a vested right in the escalator provisions because they were not a part of the law at the time the judge began his term in office. The court of appeals concluded that the 1963 Act was unconstitutional as applied to the judge because the escalator provisions were in effect when the judge took office. On appeal, the court held that the judge's rights under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 17-301 had become vested because that issue was not in dispute. Moreover, there was no basis for inferring that the judge or his widow ever waived the right to have the judge's pension benefits determined under &sect; 17-301; the acceptance of previous erroneously computed checks was not sufficient to constitute a waiver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the case for further computations of the judge's benefits. Appellate costs were taxed against the widow and the administrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants alleged error in disposing of the case on oral motion for judgment on the pleadings without the teacher having made any formal motion. On appeal, the court reversed because the chancellor erred in disposing of the case on the motion for judgment. The board's failure to follow the &sect; 49-1416(8) requirement to give written notice of its decision to the teacher tolled the teacher's 30-day time requirement for filing her petition under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-1414 until the board gave her written notice. However, it did not follow that the failure had the legal effect of nullifying the board's actions in suspending the teacher, as the chancellor held. The failure to give the teacher written notice did not prejudice her in her ability to file a petition stating the issues involved and seeking de novo review in the chancery court. In addition, the board's failure to follow Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-1416(8) procedural requirements did not warrant the finding of reinstatement with full back pay. Such a finding could be made only after a full evidentiary hearing on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant City of Goodlettsville appealed from a decision of the Chancery Court (Tennessee), which held that a City ordinance regulating the retail sale of alcoholic beverages was unconstitutional. Plaintiff liquor company brought suit alleging that Goodlettsville, Tenn., Ordinance No. 66-74 restricted its ability to compete with retailers in nearby areas who provided the same service that the liquor company was forbidden to provide in the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The liquor company claimed that the City's ordinance violated both federal and state constitutions because its prohibition on sale of chilled beverages was unreasonable, it had no basis in fact or need for its existence, and it deprived the liquor company of valuable property without compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The chancellor found that the liquor company was not injured because it was not equipped to sell chilled alcoholic beverages as it sought to do. Nevertheless, the chancellor concluded that the disputed ordinance was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the City's police power to regulate the sale of liquor. The court disagreed on that point. The court noted that the liquor company failed to show that a property interest was taken by the City of Goodlettsville, and the liquor company failed to carry its burden to establish that there was not a rational basis for the ordinance. The court found, however, that there was no unequal treatment under the ordinance pertaining to sale of chilled beverages, so it was not discriminatory or unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the finding that the liquor company was not injured by the City's ordinance, but it reversed the conclusion that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted the administrator's motion for summary judgment because of the common law rules absolving a wife from any obligation for providing necessaries, including medical care, for her husband and denying to her a right of action to recover for such necessaries paid by her. The court of appeals affirmed, and the court reversed. The court held that genuine issues as to material facts were disclosed in the record and that the wife's claim was not to be rejected because of her sex; thus, it was error to grant summary judgment for the administrator. The court ruled that the decision of the court of appeals was based upon an antiquated rule that had as its historical foundation the notion that women were second-class citizens and not entitled to the rights of men. All such precedents were no longer to be followed. There was now a duty upon a wife to provide care for her spouse when he was unable to care for himself. The former rule denying liability for the wife was violative of the equal protection guarantees of the Tennessee and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment in favor of the candidate and voided the election and declared the office vacant. The elected judge challenged the decision and argued that Chapter 145 of the Private Acts of 1973, which changed the requirements for elected judges of sessions court, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the election was void because the elected judge did not satisfy the requirement of being a licensed attorney. The Act increased the jurisdiction of the Clay County Court of General Sessions by overlapping the jurisdiction of the courts and permitting the judges to interchange.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Scrap Act required every person or corporation dealing in antique, used or scrap jewelry and precious metals to keep a log.

It further provided that the log be carefully preserved and be open to the inspection by any deputy sheriff or police officer. Defendant argued that the Scrap Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the degree of intrusion authorized by the Scrap Act, when balanced against the legislative purpose underlying its enactment, to limit channels through which thieves could convert stolen property to cash, was reasonable.

The dancers had been observed performing while wearing a &quot;g-string&quot; and transparent &quot;pasties,&quot; after which they allowed customers to fondle them. The dancers argued that the ordinance violated the First Amendment. The trial court upheld the ordinance; but the appellate court reversed. The city appealed. The court noted that the ordinance addressed conduct, not speech. The dancers had been penalized for conduct, not speech. The court observed that states had long been allowed to prohibit public nudity without requiring proof of obscenity, so long as the state tolerated nudity as a part of a larger form of expression involving the communication of ideas. The dancers' activity did not fall within the area of protected speech. Nor was the ordinance so broad that it could be interpreted to interfere with communications protected by the First Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged a judgment from the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which reversed a trial court's judgment imposing a fine after defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine for resale. The intermediate court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision as to denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence but held that, pursuant to Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14 (1796), the trial judge had no authority to impose the fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the sole question presented was whether the provisions of art. VI, &sect; 14, requiring that fines in excess of 50 dollars be imposed by a jury, may have been waived in the felony case. After the suppression hearing and on the advice of counsel, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charges and waived a trial by jury both as to guilt and punishment. The court held that: (1) the provisions of VI, &sect; 14, were manifestly an amplification of the fundamental guarantee against the imposition of excessive fines found in Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16; (2) as such, they were part of the rights guaranteed to defendant and were for his benefit and protection; (3) because defendant saw fit to waive them, such waiver was permissible and had been done in accordance with safeguards provided by both the constitution and implementing statutes or rules of criminal procedure; and (4) Metzner v. State, 128 Tenn. 45, 157 S.W. 69 (1913) and its progeny were no longer binding insofar as they held that the provisions of Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14, were limitations upon the power of the trial court which defendant could not have waived.</SPAN></P>

Several of the existing dealers in the area protested on the ground that a new dealership was not in the public interest and was not justified.

The trial court held that &sect; 4-5-117 was unconstitutional, that the commission did not provide a fair and impartial tribunal, and that the statutes creating it violated a state constitutional prohibition against the granting of monopolies. The company appealed this decision, and the court reversed concluding that there was nothing vague or unconstitutional about the statute or about the procedures to be followed. The court concluded that the legislature clearly intended that all of the procedures, together with any other relevant circumstances brought to the attention of the commission by the parties, should have been taken into account in determining the propriety of granting an additional dealership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Th taxpayer obtained &quot;borrow dirt&quot; to build the roadbed of ramps and approaches to a new bridge. The Commissioner asserted that pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-3004, a use tax was owed on the &quot;borrow dirt.&quot; The Commissioner assessed the use tax based on the fair market value. He asserted that the fair market value of &quot;borrow dirt&quot; included any royalties paid for the right to sever the dirt, plus any clearing and loading costs, and the cost of relocating any utilities. The Commissioner determined that all costs involved in the severing of the dirt, exclusive of actual transportation costs, were subject to a use tax pursuant to &sect; 67-3004. The taxpayer paid under protest and sought to recover the tax paid. The trial court did not grant the requested relief. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The application of &sect; 67-3004 required that &quot;borrow dirt&quot; be categorized as tangible personal property. The taxpayer had argued that because the legislature amended the statute to exclude from taxation the use of fill dirt, that it was not subject to the use tax. The court disagreed. The modification did not apply because it was enacted after the dispute arose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother brought the action in May of 1978 to establish the paternity and obtain an order for support of a child born in November, 1968. The mother claimed that the statutory limitations period was unconstitutional because it denied children born out of wedlock substantial benefits accorded to children born in wedlock, who could sue their fathers for support throughout their minority. The court found that the limitation was not upon illegitimate children's right to support, but upon establishing paternity, and was substantially related to the state's interest in preventing litigation of stale or fraudulent claims. The court also found that the legislature could have rationally determined that two years was long enough to present a reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in illegitimate children to assert claims on their behalf, and that longer than two years would have unreasonably increased the putative fathers' problems of proof. Thus, the court held that the statute did not violate constitutional equal protection or due process guarantees, and that the mother's action was untimely.</SPAN></P>

Another expert testified that the blood on the hammer and defendant's clothing was human and not hogs' blood and that a blood stain found on the underside of the shirt's right pocket flap showed that defendant's right side was in motion when the blood hit him. Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death because the crime was heinous and committed with such depravity as to cause the victim's brains to extrude from her skull.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was a 19 year old student who met defendant, a 37 year old male, at a bus station.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted and charged with violating the statute. On considering a motion to dismiss the indictment, the trial judge concluded that the statute is an overbroad restraint of freedom of expression contrary to U.S. Const. amend. I and Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19. On review, the court ruled that a state had a strong and valid interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process. As such, the court held that one way states ensured the integrity of the electoral process was to impose criminal sanctions upon persons who anonymously publish or distribute campaign literature and advertisements. The court held that the statute ensured that voters had information which would aid them in assessing the bias, interest, and credibility of the person or organization disseminating information about political candidates, and in determining the weight to be given a particular statement. As such, the court held that there did not appear to be a less restrictive means of furthering the legitimate purposes than through a campaign literature disclosure law, and that Tenn. Code Ann. 2-19-120 could not be said to be overly broad.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the evidence tendered by defendant and excluded by the trial court was not relevant to, nor did it have any probative value on the issue of punishment, but consisted of matters properly to be considered by the legislature in deciding whether the death penalty was ever a justified punishment for a person convicted of murder in the first degree. The court was of the opinion that the evidence proved defendant's guilt of the several crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The court was also of the opinion that the evidence supported the jury's imposition of the death penalty on its finding of aggravating circumstances listed in the Tennessee Death Penalty Act and the lack of any mitigating circumstance. The jury instructions were complete and clear, the jury had the instructions before them as they deliberated, and, according to the affidavit, the juror in question read the instructions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the Senate Reapportionment Act (Act) contending the Act violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 6, which provided that no county could be divided in forming a senate district. Appellants contended there was no basis under the Tennessee Constitution on which to hold the Act invalid since the Act complied with the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; requirements of the Equal Protection Clause and contended the plan was close to mathematical perfection in that it had a total maximum variance of less than two percent. The court reversed the chancery court's order sustaining appellees' motion for summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held the case was not a proper case for summary judgment since there was conflicting evidence as to the maximum total variance in the proposed reapportionment plans and the record failed to establish whether either plan diluted minority voting strength. The court held the question of whether the state made a good faith effort to construct senatorial districts that complied with both federal and state constitutions was an issue of fact that required a full evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that (1) there was no constitutional requirement that the statute require prior convictions of drug sales in order to support the conviction where the elements of the crime of being an habitual drug offender were set out in the statute; (2) the statute was not vague where it sufficiently put defendant on notice of what actions - at least three acts of selling controlled substances - were proscribed; (3) the statute did not encourage arbitrary and erratic arrests because police officers were not required to jeopardize an investigation and arrest offenders after a first or second violation; and (4) the statute did not violate defendant's equal protection rights because there was a rational relationship between the provisions of the statute and the legitimate governmental interest of deterring drug sales.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a city liquor referendum carried by only a six-vote margin, those who opposed it filed a suit claiming that voters had been illegally &quot;prevented&quot; from voting. The lower court voided the referendum on the ground that once certain annexees had registered, their registration was permanent and they were not required to &quot;re-register&quot; when they were annexed. The court reversed. This was a question of transfer of registration, not reregistration. The election commission had no way of knowing whether or not a given voter was affected by the change in precinct boundaries, and thus the commission was called upon to exercise discretion once it met its initial burden under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-105 of notification. Once the commission provided all possible notice, both actual and constructive, the election officials at each precinct were entitled to rely upon the registration lists as they existed on election day. As to missed voters, only two voters specifically asked if there was a way for them to vote and were still directed to vote &quot;outside&quot; the city. The existence of two uncertain votes when the referendum passed by six votes did not justify voiding the entire election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act, which authorized the county to impose a privilege tax upon the occupancy of hotels, required hotel operators to collect the tax, to remit it to the county, and to keep records in connection therewith. Because the Act failed to compensate hotel operators for keeping records and for collecting and remitting the tax, appellant filed an action, claiming that the Act was unconstitutional. In support of this claim, appellant argued that the Act's failure to provide compensation constituted an unconstitutional taking of property under &sect; 21. Following an unfavorable judgment, appellant sought review. In upholding the Act's constitutionality, the court held that the Act was a legitimate exercise of the power of taxation and that the challenged provisions were properly incident thereto. The court also held that there was a marked difference between the power of eminent domain and the power to taxation. Moreover, the court held that &quot;particular services&quot; as used in &sect; 21 meant peculiar or limited services. Consequently, the court held that ordinary services, such as might be required of all citizens, or officials, by general or valid special laws, were not &quot;particular services.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">County employees had challenged modifications made by the county to its retirement and pension plan. The county court held that the modifications were unconstitutional as they impaired the obligations of the implied employment contracts. The court of appeals held that the plan was governed by the common law of contracts; that employees under the plan had the vested right to earn the benefits of the plan as it existed and under the conditions of the plan as it existed upon entering into service of the county and accepting the plan as offered by contributing thereto. On appeal, the court reversed and rendered judgment in favor of the county. The court opined that necessary changes in public employee pension plans were allowed in order to safeguard the stability and actuarial soundness of the plan, provided that no such modification adversely affected an employee who had complied with all conditions necessary to have been eligible for a retirement allowance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The food store owner filed an application with the county administrative board that sought a permit for the sale of beer for off-the-premises consumption. The board denied the application solely upon the ground that the owner of a residential dwelling house located within 300 feet of the store objected to the issuance of the permit. The food store owner challenged the board's decision to the trial court, and the trial court affirmed the board's decision. The food store owner again filed an appeal. She claimed that the statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-5-105(f), upon which the board's decision was based, was unconstitutional because it constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power to private individuals. The court disagreed. The court found that under &sect; 57-5-105(f), the protesting residential owner did not exercise any legislative power by merely protesting because he neither had the power to grant nor deny a permit for the sale of beer. The court concluded that &sect; 57-5-105(f) was a valid enactment, and the board properly based its decision on &sect; 57-5-105(f).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his codefendant were convicted of murder after defendant confessed to shooting the victim. The court held that defendant's confession was voluntary, reasoning that defendant was twice advised of his Miranda rights before confessing, and that despite defendant's contention that he gave the confession in order that police would let him sleep, the record indicated that defendant initiated the interview leading to the confession by indicting he had something to tell the officers. The court also held that the jury's imposition of death was supported by sufficient evidence regarding its finding of aggravating circumstances, including numerous previous offenses, and its finding of a lack if mitigating circumstances under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2404(i). The court then held that the Tennessee Death Penalty Act was constitutional, noting that all issues raised by defendant on that point had been previously resolved in other cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the trial court (Tennessee), which convicted him of violating statutes regulating the operation of automobile graveyards or junkyards, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-5-901 to 905 and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-20-101 to 121.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that both sets of statutes were unconstitutional and represented an improper exercise of the State's police power because both rested entirely upon aesthetic considerations. Despite a sparse record, defendant insisted that he was entitled to a finding of fact that, as applied to his business, the only purpose served by the regulatory statutes was an aesthetic one, to enhance the beauty of the landscape. The court upheld the convictions. Although the court previously determined that the exercise of police power based solely upon aesthetic considerations could not be sustained, the court concluded that this was no longer the prevailing view. The court held that in modern society, aesthetic considerations could well constitute a legitimate basis for the exercise of police power, depending upon the facts and circumstances. In any event, defendant had ample opportunity in the case but failed to offer evidence that, as applied to his property, the legislation served nothing but aesthetic purposes. The court simply could not conclude from the record that aesthetics alone constituted the only conceivable basis for application of the statutes to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Commissioner of Revenue challenged a decision of the Chancery Court of Davidson County (Tennessee), which held that dividends received by appellee corporation from its subsidiary constituted nonapportionable income, that the deduction was wiped out because the commissions paid to the subsidiary related to the production of nonapportionable income, and that the corporation could recover excess prepayments of taxes not made under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation was a multi-state business licensed to do business in Tennessee. Its subsidiary was a domestic international sales corporation. In order to achieve substantial tax savings, the corporation paid commissions to the subsidiary based upon export sales. The trial court found that the corporation's deduction for nonapportionable income was wiped out because the commissions paid to the subsidiary related to the production of the nonapportionable income. The court held that that the corporation could deduct from its net earnings the payment of commissions that represented a reimbursement of selling expenses incurred by its subsidiary but not payments made solely to accomplish a federal tax savings. Further, the trial court correctly netted the commissions against the dividends received by the corporation, thereby reducing the deduction to zero, because without the commissions there would have been no dividends. Finally, the court found that the corporation had a right to a refund of excessive prepayment of taxes, even though the taxes were not paid under protest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the trial court erred in allowing the corporation to deduct the full amount of the commissions it paid to its subsidiaries from its gross profits.

The matter was remanded for entry of an order consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Shelby Criminal Court No. One (Tennessee), which was entered on a jury's verdict that convicted defendant as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree. The trial court concurred with the death penalty sentence, which was imposed by the jury after a bifurcated trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant employed an escaped convict to kill an undercover agent for a police vice squad. As a result of the agent's activities, indictments had been returned against defendant and others in an illegal gambling operation. The agent was to be the principal witness for the prosecution. The court affirmed the judgment that convicted defendant as an accessory before the fact to murder. The court held that the jury properly found that there were no mitigating circumstances for defendant's sentence, and that an aggravating circumstance was that he had employed another to commit the murder for remuneration or the promise thereof. The court held that the death penalty was not violative of the United States and Tennessee constitutional provisions regarding cruel and unusual punishment. The fact that defendant did not himself pull the trigger or personally commit the homicide did not render the death sentence against him disproportionate. Defendant's bifurcated trial did not place him in double jeopardy. The sentencing phase of the trial was concerned only with the punishment and did not constitute a second trial for the same offense or create a separate or additional offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed from the Criminal Court of Shelby County (Tennessee), which dismissed an indictment charging defendant with practicing dentistry at a time when his license to practice had been revoked, in violation of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with practicing dentistry at a time when he did not have a license. The trial court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the statute under which he was charged violated his equal protection of the law. This was based upon the fact that while the practice of dentistry without a license could result in jail time or a fine, the sentence for practicing medicine without a license was merely a fine. The court reversed the dismissal of the indictment because there was no violation of defendant's equal protection rights. The court found that people practicing medicine without a license could still be sentenced to jail time for violating, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 63-126, which prevented people from practicing the healing arts without a license. The court determined that dentistry was a separate profession from medicine, and the legislature was empowered to provide for different penalties for different professions. Dentists and doctors were not members of a class that must have been treated alike, and therefore, defendant's equal protection rights were not violated. The court remanded the matter for trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was overwhelming proof of the guilt of all three defendants, and the assignments of error challenging sufficiency of the evidence were overruled.

The court determined that there was material evidence in the record justifying the discretion exercised by the jurors in imposing death sentences on two of defendants while sentencing third defendant to life imprisonment. The court recognized that the jury found aggravating circumstances which were clearly sustained by the proof, including the fact that this was a murder for hire and that it was particularly brutal and atrocious.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, finding aggravating factors under &sect; 39-2404. He appealed, claiming among other things that the sentence was grossly disproportionate because he only accompanied the killer and that &sect; 39-2404 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and sentence, holding that the Tennessee Death Penalty Act was constitutional. The Act was not unconstitutionally vague and it did mandate a death sentence. Under &sect; 39-2404(f) the state had the burden of proof to establish the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and the jury had to specifically find that those factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances before they were justified in imposing the death penalty. Defendant's death sentence was justified. Felony murder was an aggravating circumstance that allowed imposition of the death penalty, and the evidence showed that defendant was an active participant in the robbery in which the victim was killed. In addition, defendant's witness had the right to assert his privilege against self-incrimination and it was not possible to force him to testify, despite the purpose of compulsory process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed with the lower court that the Civil Investigative Demand (CID) served on appellee was invalid, not on the basis that the CID statute was unconstitutional, but rather on the basis that the CID was not issued by the proper party. Neither did it set forth with sufficient particularity the matter under investigation nor identify the parties to the inquiry. Since a CID that met the material requirements of the CID statutes could be issued, the court next considered appellee's challenge to the basic authority of the attorney general to investigate possible violations of the antitrust laws of the State of Tennessee, and the challenge to the constitutionality of the CID statutes. The attorney general had the authority to investigate possible violations of the antitrust laws of the state. This duty had not been delegated to any other individual or agency of state government. It logically followed that the statutorily created responsibility imposed on the attorney general to enforce the antitrust laws included the authority to investigate possible violations. The court held that the CID statutes comported with the fundamental fairness requirement of Wardius.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, individual partners and mining company, appealed the judgment from the Chancery Court, White County (Tennessee), which upheld the denial of their strip mining permit by the board of reclamation review and found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 64-511 (Supp. 1980) and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 58-1544(a)(6)(B) (Supp. 1979) were constitutional. The Court of Appeals transferred the case because the sole issue was the constitutionality of the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sole issue was the constitutionality of 1977 Tenn. Pub. Acts 164, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 64-511 (Supp. 1980) and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 58-1544(a)(6)(B) (Supp. 1979). The two statutes concern the conflict between landowners and the owners of mineral rights (owners) in the same property. The owners claimed that said statutes impaired their contractual rights under U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The owners sought to strip mine coal from defendant landowners' property. The strip mining permit was denied because the owners did not submit with their application certain documents that expressly allowed strip mining or the affidavits of surface owners' consent. The owners alleged that ownership of the mineral rights entitled them to destroy the surface at least temporarily, despite the fact that other individuals owned and enjoyed the rights to that surface. Because strip mining was unknown in White County when the mineral and surface estates were severed, the court held that the contracting parties did not intend for one party to own the right to use and enjoy the surface of the land and for another party to own the right to completely disrupt that surface.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the chancery court. The court concluded that there was no right to strip mine that accompanied ownership of the mineral rights, nor was there any evidence that the parties intended a contrary result.</SPAN></P>

As individuals, the minority members of the commission and the county court were not aggrieved by the adjudication that the private act was unconstitutional.

Code Ann. &sect; 50-1013 that only had a presumption of dependency in favor of widows and not for widowers and also granted widows 50 percent of their husband's salaries, while only providing widowers 20 percent of their wives' salaries. The lower court held that the statute was void as unconstitutional, and the court affirmed. The court found that the mere fact that more wives are financially dependent on their husbands than the other way around was an insufficient reason to support the presumption only in favor of widows' dependency. The court determined that the lower court was correct in extending to widowers the benefit of the conclusive presumption that was afforded to widows and in holding that widowers were entitled to the same amount of benefits as widows.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the conviction. The court granted defendant's petition for certiorari primarily to consider the sufficiency of the convicting evidence in light of the defense of lack of mental capacity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought reversal of his murder conviction on the ground that he suffered from the inability to control his conduct at the time of the crime. The court upheld the conviction and held that there was ample material evidence from which the jury could conclude that defendant did not lack the requisite mental capacity. The court found it difficult to conceive that defendant could have effectively escaped from a wrecked vehicle shortly after the murder and eluded captivity for weeks thereafter if he was unable to control his conduct at the time of the murder. Defendant's experts opined that defendant's lack of medication for seven days before the murder rendered him unable to control his conduct. The court deemed the issue a question of fact for the jury. The fact that defendant recognized and conversed with people he knew in Nashville and appeared to be in control of himself several weeks after the murder was evidence from which the jury could conclude that defendant was not psychotic or out of control at the time of the murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The language of the first count of each indictment paralleled the language of Tenn.

The State conceded that if the last paragraph of the statute placed the burden of persuasion on the defendant, it was unconstitutional. The State alleged that the statute was ambiguous and that one of the two possible constructions was constitutional. The court held that the statute was not ambiguous and that the second count of each indictment unconstitutionally placed the burden of persuasion on defendants. The court held, however, that the deletion of the unconstitutional portion of the statute left the remainder of the statute in full force and effect. The court held that the trial court erred in dismissing both counts of the indictments because the first count of each indictment did not unconstitutionally place the burden of persuasion on defendants.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 67-5801 et seq., thus suspending the general law in violation of Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 8. On appeal, reversed the judgment of the lower court. The court noted that this situation was distinguishable from one where the expenditures were authorized pursuant to clearly expressed public policy of the State, responsive to a declared crisis and with standards and checks to be exercised by public officials upon the use of the funds. The court noted that express language of Pigeon Forge, Tenn., Ordinance 143 mandated the use of 75 percent of the tax revenue for the benefit of the business community and tourism, leaving the public at large with only the remote hope that it could derive some incidental benefit from the promotion of private business enterprises wherein neither it nor its representatives had any participation in management or profits. The court held that the Ordinance allocated tax revenues beyond the pale of a public purpose in violation of the Tennessee Constitution.

The court found that the differing treatment violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, did not comport with the &quot;law of the land,&quot; Tenn. Const. art.

The juveniles brought habeas corpus proceedings to challenge an adjudication of delinquency and their commitment to the Department of Corrections. The juveniles challenged their imprisonment on the grounds that the judge who committed them was not a lawyer. The trial court found in the juveniles' favor and the appeals court reversed. The juveniles sought further review. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision, agreeing with the trial court that the possibility that the trial judge was not a licensed attorney raised constitutional questions that required reversal. The court held that it was fundamental to due process that defendants be granted a fair trial in a fair tribunal, which required a licensed attorney to serve as a judge to ensure due process.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the officers who stopped defendant's car had a description of the person suspected of the crimes and defendant matched that description. The court held that defendant provided a voluntary consent to the search of his car which resulted in the finding of incriminating evidence. In this case, a crime had been committed. Defendant was not arrested until after the automobile was stopped and incriminating evidence found in the automobile and on his person. That evidence, coupled with the fact that defendant fit the detailed description of the person seen leaving the scene of the crime, constituted probable cause and justified the arrest of defendant. The court found that evidence including the fact that the victim was shot three times, was sufficient to constitute premeditation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the amendments. It rejected the claim that the amendments, &sect; 13-801 et seq., violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, by requiring that the county appropriate funds to a municipal body. The court ruled that the upgrading of blighted urban areas was not only a municipal purpose, but was the proper concern of the county and the state. The state was allowed to direct a county to expend funds for a state purpose or for a purpose common to the state and county without violating &sect; 29. The amended statutes also did not authorize the lending of public credit without prior authorization by the electorate. Further, not every body with delegated authority was directly accountable to the electorate. The objections to the amendments were based on a misconception of the nature of tax increment financing. They provided for mandated appropriations, whose amount was regulated by taxes received from the subject property, and not for a transfer of the taxing power.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that plaintiff had failed to show that it was entitled to the relief sought and found that defendant had proceeded legally. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) venue was proper in either of the two counties affected by the annexation; (2) in &sect; 6-317, the legislature did not grant something that was previously a common right so &sect; 6-317 did not involve granting a monopoly to large cities; (3) in the limited circumstance presented, the legislature made the reasonable judgment that it was in the public interest that the larger city would prevail; (4) the legislature granted to small cities the same standing to challenge annexation that was granted to owners of property in the territory to be annexed; and (5) plaintiff's claim that, from its view, defendant's action was unreasonable was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

Ultimately, he was acquitted and filed a petition under &sect; 40-4001 to have all references to the charges removed from records maintained by any public official. The only records left in dispute were certain jail records maintained by the sheriff and a file kept by the district attorney. The trial judge denied the petition insofar as it sought the destruction of those references to defendant in materials maintained by the sheriff or the district attorney, holding that those were not &quot;public records&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 40-4001. The appellate court reversed and held that &sect; 40-4001 required the destruction, in certain instances, of all records relating to a criminal charge, rather than merely those records open to public inspection. On review, the court affirmed and held that the purpose of the statute was to minimize the stigma that attached to one charged with a crime by removing any reference to the accusation in all records maintained by a public officer, whether those records be for public inspection or internal use. &quot;Public records&quot; referred to all records maintained by a public official.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Constitutional Convention of 1977 extensively rewrote constitutional provisions regarding the various county officers and the determination of the proper method for filling vacancies and provided a general framework for the government of Tennessee counties. In holding that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-551(b) was unconstitutional, the trial judge ordered a special election for the purpose of electing a county executive and a county legislative body and further held that upon the election of a county executive the county judge would &quot;exercise only the judicial functions of an inferior court.&quot; The parties disputed whether &sect; 5-551(b) was constitutional. The court held that it was constitutional because the Tennessee Legislature had a right to provide a basic structure for Tennessee counties and to provide for it in an orderly manner. The court concluded that the existing government of Knox County continued until August 31, 1980. The county executive and the members of the county legislative body elected at the general election of 1980 will serve for a period of two years in order to bring Knox County into synchronization with the general statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the indictments on the grounds that defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated. The court of appeals reversed and reinstated the indictments.

The court held that a trial in state court after defendant's previous conviction in federal court for the same offense on the basis of the same act would not subject defendant to double jeopardy under the &quot;dual sovereignties&quot; doctrine. The court recognized that the procedure had been criticized, but because the United States Supreme Court allowed such a procedure, it was bound by that decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted under Tenn.

The intermediate appellate court held that &sect; 39-2802 created an unconstitutional inference. On appeal, the court reversed the intermediate court's decision, and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial. The court held that the language of &sect; 39-2802 only created a permissive inference and was only unconstitutional if it were irrational for the jurors to find the presumed fact. The court also held that the evidence that the other parties involved in the crime wore masks was sufficient to justify the use of the permissive inference. However, the court found that the trial court committed a reversible error by failing to give an express jury instruction regarding the effect of the inference and giving an instruction that was susceptible to the interpretation that the jury must convict defendant upon a showing a of masked entry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One citation charged the permittee with violating the Metropolitan Government of Nashville, Tennessee Code. The board suspended the permittee's license for 60 days. A second citation charged the permittee with allowing any intoxicated person to loiter on or about the premises, and the board suspended its license for 30 days. The trial court reversed the board's decisions. The court held that the preponderance of the evidence supported the trial court's finding of insufficient evidence to support the 60-day suspension. The proof was wholly inadequate to support the charges. The court upheld the board's action of suspending the permitee's license for a period of 30 days. The permittee allowed a drunk to loiter at its premises under circumstances that were known, or should have been known, to the permittee or its employees in violation of Metropolitan Government of Nashville, Tenn., Code &sect; 5-1-23(k). Section 5-1-23(k) was not unconstitutionally vague. It applied only to beer permittees and their employees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case involved two actions, one in the nature of quo warranto brought pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2801 et seq. by plaintiff District Attorney against defendants, an attorney serving as juvenile judge pro tempore and a county executive, and the other in the nature of mandamus brought by the attorney against the county executive. The cases were consolidated for review upon appeal from the Circuit Court for Sevier County (Tennessee).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county executive claimed the office of juvenile court judge by virtue of his election as county executive and the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 5-606 (1978). The attorney claimed the office by virtue of his election by the legislative body of the county to fill to fill the vacancy created by the disqualification of the county executive as a result of his being under 30 years of age and not being an attorney. The court concluded that 1978 Tenn. Pub. Acts 934, &sect; 17, purporting to vest in the county executive the judicial authority formerly exercised by the county judge, was unconstitutional and invalid, and held that the invalid provision could be elided pursuant to &sect; 43 of the Act because the remainder was a workable and coherent whole that could be given effect. However, because the vacancy occurred at the time the judgment of the trial court became final or, if appealed, when the judgment of the court of last resort became final, the election of the attorney was invalid. The court held that the county executive could not lawfully be compelled by mandamus to pay the attorney's claim to a salary for acting as the juvenile judge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court in the mandamus action and dismissed the complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the standards to be used by the trier of fact, judge or jury, to support a finding that materials were obscene and unprotected by the First Amendment were: (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicted or described, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The court held that the Act violated both the state and Federal Constitutions and that the Act's subdefinitions of the key words and phrases of the obscenity standards were void for constitutional infirmities and that the portion of the Act which classified those who were subject to and exempt from its criminal penalties was also void. Because the act contained no legally cognizable offense nor identifiable parties to charge, it was void and of no force and effect.

Priv. Acts 297, as amended by 1977 Tenn. Priv. Acts 125, were constitutional and an order directing the conveyance of certain hospital properties. The trial court granted the requested relief, but the Court of Appeals (Tennessee) held that the acts unconstitutionally violated Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9 and art. II, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The gist of the 1976 act was the establishment of the hospital authority, with an accompanying recitation of its powers, duties, and operation through its board of trustees and financial review committee. The court stated that the purpose of the caption rule was to prevent legislative logrolling and not to provide a yardstick by which to measure the purview of an act. The court found that the caption adequately apprised the legislature and public of the subject and body of the act. Although neither the caption nor the body of the 1976 act complied with Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 17, requiring recitation of the specific acts superseded by its enactment, it did not destroy the validity of the act. The court also held that because a referendatory vote was only required for acts that accomplished a consolidation, not for acts that amended or repealed a consolidation, a referendum was not required to accomplish the purpose of the 1977 act. Further, although the acts authorized the trustees to promulgate rules, regulations, and policies of the hospital, such was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in violation of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1, 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court that found that the acts were unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city commissioners, constituting the school board of the city, brought an action against the county, the county judge, the county trustee, and the surety on the trustee's official bond, contending that Federal Revenue Sharing Funds given to the county for the operation and maintenance of county schools should be apportioned. The trial judge agreed, holding that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-605 required such a result. The court of appeals reversed, holding that &sect; 49-605 had no application to funds received by the county under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, as amended. The court agreed with the decision of the court of appeals. It noted that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 49-605 required a county to apportion school funds received from the state, county, or other political subdivision. However, Federal Revenue Sharing Funds originated from the federal government. Further, Federal Revenue Sharing Funds were not required to be used by a county for school purposes. Finally, the court noted that the city already received an allocation of Federal Sharing Funds wholly separate and apart from those received by the county.</SPAN></P>

However, it permitted the distribution, without charge, to any willing recipient. Although the ordinance was entitled to the presumption of validity, it had other problems that placed it beyond the legitimate reach of the presumptive lifeline.

The State of Tennessee then authorized a general law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5801 et seq., permitting all cities in Tennessee to impose a business privilege tax. The city imposed both taxes. The taxpayer filed a complaint on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated for relief from the effect of both taxes. Summary judgment was entered in favor of the city and affirmed on appeal. On further appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that any error for failure to hold a hearing before summary judgment was granted was corrected by a hearing on the taxpayer's motion to reconsider. The court further held that the fact that there were two business privilege taxes was not in and of itself unconstitutional as a double taxation. The court determined that the city was entitled to a special classification because it demonstrated special circumstances as a tourist town, which demanded greater city service expenditure. The court concluded that the special classification of the city was proper and entitled the city to collect both business privilege taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, attorney general and landowner, challenged a ruling from a circuit court (Tennessee), which denied the prayer of the landowner to fix a first lien on defendant tenant's mobile home and held that the portion of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-712 that provided for such a lien was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenant paid property taxes directly to a city rather than to the landowner; the property assessed was a mobile home owned by the tenant and located on a lot that the tenant leased from the landowner. The landowner had also paid the taxes pursuant to &sect; 67-612 and sought reimbursement from the tenant, as authorized by that provision. The landowner also sought a first lien on the tenant's mobile home. The tenant refused to pay, and the landowner filed the instant action. The circuit court permitted the landowner to recover the taxes from the tenant but declared &sect; 67-612 unconstitutional insofar as it provided for a first lien. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 67-612 was not unconstitutional. The lien granted to mobile home park landowners was not a &quot;tax lien&quot; because it was not granted to a governmental entity. Instead it secured the landowner's claim for reimbursement against the mobile home owner for the amount of taxes on the mobile home that the landowner had already paid. Section 64-2101, which provided the procedure for enforcement of the lien in question, gave ample protection to innocent mobile home purchasers for value.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the cause for further proceedings and adjudged costs against the tenant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioners of Mental Health and Mental Retardation added diazepam as a schedule IV drug under the Rules and Regulations of the State of Tennessee. Thereafter, defendant was indicted for selling diazepam in violation of the Tennessee Drug Control Act. Defendant then filed a motion to quash the indictment. The trial judge found the provisions authorizing the addition of diazepam as a schedule IV drug was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and quashed the indictment. On appeal, the court held that although the legislature was not able to delegate power that was purely legislative, it could, with certain qualifications, delegate to an administrative agency the authority necessary to implement the expressed policy and program of a given statute. Next, the court held that the statutory scheme of the Tennessee Drug Control Act was more than adequate to provide the commissioners with the requisite guidance to determine and effect the will of the legislature. Additionally, the court held that there was no indication that regulations defining the offense for which defendant was indicted were not reasonably accessible to any person.</SPAN></P>

For that violation of the city ordinance, the employee was arrested and upon trial in the city court was fined the sum of $ 15.00.The sole issue on appeal was the legality of ordinance 76-9, &sect; 4. The city argued that the lifting of the ban on gambling on pinball machines by the enactment of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2033(2), (4) did not thereby inhibit it from enforcing its ordinance against &quot;payoffs&quot; on pinball machines and imposing penalties for violations. The court affirmed, holding that there could be no direct conflict between the provisions of a municipal ordinance and an act of the legislature adversely affecting the constitutional rights of a citizen. The court held that when the constitutional rights of a citizen were at issue, or when questions of due process or equal protection of the law were involved, an act of the legislature would prevail over the provisions of a municipal ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Because of the population provisions of the Act, only two counties were subject to it. The employees were bailiffs and process servers. Under the Act, the employees were entitled to a minimum salary. The court found that there was no ambiguity in the Act. The court saw no just reason to differentiate or discriminate between county officials and county employees. The Act was public and general in form. The court held that the Act was also public in effect and application, not private or local in effect; thus, the Act was valid under Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 9. The Act did not contravene the provisions of Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8.

When defendant claimed the package in Memphis, he was arrested by the local police. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress on the grounds that the Los Angeles search and seizure was illegal, effectively ending the state's case because Tennessee law did not provide for direct interlocutory appeal of such rulings. On review, the court held that the trial court's ruling was fundamentally illegal and an abuse of discretion because the air carrier had the authority to inspect packages without a warrant and the Los Angeles police were not a party to the search and seizure. Further, common law writs of certiorari and supersedeas were appropriate means to challenge the improper granting of a motion to suppress because the ruling denied the state its right to its day in court, and no other means was available to the state to seek redress of the trial court's action.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that although legislation in the state expanded the inheritance rights of children born out of wedlock only upon an adjudication of paternity before the death of the father, the court interpreted the policy of that legislation to be one of sanctioning inheritance if the father-child relationship was clearly established. The court noted that the common law was nothing but reason.

Under Harriman, Tenn., Ordinance 2-201, beer was not sold in the city limits until an area where several businesses had been selling beer under permit from the county beer board was annexed by the city. Those establishments that sold beer at the time of annexation were allowed to do so under their outstanding permits. When the businesses were sold, or passed to new hands, the board reissued permits to the new proprietors. The city never issued any permits. The county issued a permit to the applicant who opened a new establishment in the annexed area. The city refused to recognize the permit and revoked by resolution the authority of the board to issue a permit to any business located in the city. The city denied appellant's application. The court found that the city was estopped to enforce its ordinance forbidding the sale against those holding valid county permits at the time of annexation. But, that estoppel did not benefit the applicant who did not hold a valid permit prior to annexation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the suit was time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The suit alleged that a referendum question reducing the term of county judges to four years was invalid because it was misleading and violated Tenn.

VI, &sect; 4, which fixed a county judge's terms of office at eight years. The action sought to have the referendum election declared void, that the 1974 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 187 (Act) should be declared unconstitutional, and that the existing county judge's status should not be altered. The intervenor argued that the complaint should be dismissed because it amounted to an election contest that was not filed within 10 days following the election, as required by Tenn.

The court held that: (1) the action was time-barred; (2) all judicial functions, powers, and responsibilities were transferred from the office of county judge to the Court of General Sessions and the office of county judge ceased to be a court within the meaning of Tenn.

The court noted that the tax in question was a tax in lieu of any tax upon the banks' property and it was immaterial to the taxing authority, or the legality thereof, whether the tax ultimately fell upon the bank or the stockholder. Therefore, the banks' claim that it was illegally taxed because its holdings were taxed was without merit. The court reasoned that where two interpretations were possible, one of which would invalidate and the other validate, the presumption was that the valid interpretation was intended. For these reasons, the court held that Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28, as amended effective January 1, 1973, did not affect the validity of the method of taxation in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 67-715-67-728. The court noted that no legislative change was made until after 1975, and the assessments for that year upon the banks were valid.

The court held that a violation of the ordinance did not conflict with Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6 and 14 because petty offenses punishable with fines up to 50 dollars, such as the one at issue, were not embraced within those constitutional provisions. The court also held that the ordinance could be construed, interpreted, and applied within constitutional limitations because it did not prohibit anything except the deliberate, willful, and knowing selling or displaying for commercial distribution of pornography to young people. Finally, the court held that the ordinance was not preempted because nothing in the state statutes dealing with the sale or exhibition of pornographic material to minors indicated that the General Assembly intended to prohibit municipal corporations from adopting local ordinances on the same subject.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged the decision of a trial court (Tennessee) that invalidated an annexation ordinance adopted by the city that annexed an 806 acre parcel. Appellee property owner, who owned an 85 acre tract wholly within the annexed territory, initiated a quo warranto proceeding pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 6-310 contesting the validity of the annexation ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner argued that its property constituted an &quot;industrial plant development&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 6-310, and therefore, that the city had the burden of proving that the annexation of its property was not unreasonable. The court reversed the decision that held that the ordinance was invalid. The court found that &sect; 6-310 was not applicable when the industrial development was included within a larger area annexed in good faith. The court agreed, however, that the city had the burden of proving that the annexation ordinance was reasonable for the overall well being of the communities involved. In determining the reasonableness of an annexation ordinance, the court noted that consideration had to have been given to the necessity for or use of municipal services, the present ability and intent of the municipality to render municipal services when and as needed, and whether the annexation was for the sole purpose of increasing municipal revenues without the ability to benefit the annexed area by rendering municipal services. The court concluded that the annexation was necessary for the welfare of the property owners as well as the municipality as a whole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision that held that the city's annexation ordinance was invalid and remanded the action for the entry of a decree declaring the ordinance in question to have been valid in the property owner's action seeking to invalidate the annexation ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, the District Attorney General of Knox County, Tennessee, sued appellant businesses seeking to enjoin the businesses from the further exhibition of several obscene films.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Attorney brought separate actions against the businesses under the 1974 Obscenity Statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-3010 -- 39-3022, seeking to enjoin the further exhibition of various untitled movies. The trial court found the films to be obscene and permanently enjoined the businesses from exhibiting the pictures described in the complaint, and any film, picture, publication, or other matter which depicted explicit acts of fellatio, cunnilingus, and excretory function of the human body. The court held that nothing in the Act supported the issuance of an injunction restraining the future showing of unnamed and un-described films. The injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint on the freedom of expression. Hence, the injunctions prohibiting the businesses from the future showing of untitled and un-described films, not the subject of these actions, was reversed. Moreover, the descriptions of the specific movies subject to the injunction were not described in the injunctions other than by reference. This was contrary to the requirement set forth in Tenn. R. Civ. P. 65.02, and necessitated a modification of the injunctions for them to be effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The professors were hired by the universities at a time when the State Board of Education was governed by an invalid regulation providing for a five-year probationary period, after which educators were entitled to tenure if their services were satisfactory. Each professor was notified that one of their &quot;fringe benefits&quot; was the chance to be recommended for tenure after a period of five years of satisfactory service. Before their fifth year of employment, the professors were tendered termination contracts. The professors brought an action against the universities and officials alleging that they were entitled to tenure and that their termination was improper because the regulation was invalid, and a prior regulation providing for a three-year probationary period applied instead. The trial court entered decrees in favor of the universities and officials. The court affirmed the decrees, holding that none of the professors acquired tenure because parties who dealt with each other in good faith in reliance upon an invalid regulation and who had materially altered their positions in reliance upon the regulation could not invoke the aid of the courts to undo what they themselves had done.</SPAN></P>

The burden was on the city to prove the reasonableness of the ordinance. The court further found that the city did meet its burden.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Commissioner of Revenue, State of Tennessee, challenged an order of the Chancery Court (Tennessee), which found in favor of appellee taxpayers and ordered that the Commissioner refund motor vehicle license taxes paid under protest by the taxpayers, who used trucks to haul coal in their business. The Chancellor held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-423(G) (1976), pursuant to which the taxes were assessed, violated Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State contended that trucks belonging to the taxpayers violated the maximum allowable gross weight limitation set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-1109 and therefore revoked their favorable &quot;zone tag&quot; privileges and required that the trucks be re-registered under the general licensing law. The taxpayers paid the higher tax they were subsequently assessed, plus a 20 percent penalty pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-514. They then sued to recover the additional motor vehicle taxes and penalty. The court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-423(G) (1976) was intended to erase the private carrier-public carrier distinction, thereby making private carriers subject to essentially the same penalties for violations of the territorial limitation or maximum gross weight limitation as were public carriers. Further, the court rejected the taxpayers' contention that &sect; 59-423(G) violated Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17, finding that the constitutional provision was satisfied because the caption of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-423(G) reflected the purpose of that amendatory act. However, the court found that the State lacked the right to impose the 20 percent penalty provision under &sect; 59-423(G).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the Chancery Court's decision in part and affirmed it in part. The court ordered the case to be remanded to the Chancery Court for modification of the decree as set forth in the opinion. The judgment in favor of one taxpayer was reduced by $ 1,700 to $ 339, and the judgment in favor of the second taxpayer was reduced by $ 1133 to $ 226.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner conducted an audit of those returns and in 1976 an assessment for additional taxes was made against the taxpayer. The taxpayer contended that &sect; 67-1323, which was amended while the audit was being conducted, had retroactive application and reduced the period within which collection proceedings for delinquent taxes had to be commenced from six years to three years. The Commissioner refused to accept the taxpayer's contention and the taxpayer paid the taxes under protest and filed an action to recover them. The chancery court entered judgment for the taxpayer and the Commissioner appealed. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the action, finding there was no intent by the legislature to have the amended statute applied retroactively. The legislative enactment that included the amendment to &sect; 67-1323 included the creation of new criminal offenses and criminal sanctions, and to give retroactive application to those provisions would mean the legislature intended to create ex post facto criminal laws, making them unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On rehearing, the court held that it had answered both questions fully and finally.

The court noted that the latter doctrine had some validity. But, the court held that the better, more equitable, and more realistic rule was that an unconstitutional act was not void, but voidable only, until condemned by judicial decision. Under the applicable criteria, the court held that its original decision applied to all notes, contracts, and obligations signed or incurred on and after August 23, 1977 and to all interest accruing on and after that date, irrespective of the date an instrument was signed or the obligation was incurred. The decision applied retroactively to all cases, including the case at bar, where there had not been strict compliance with the Industrial Loan and Thrift Company Act, Tenn.

Const. art. 11, &sect; 7 and that the Tennessee Industrial Loan and Thrift Act (Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2007, was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lender was organized under the Act and sought to recover the aggregate balance due on the notes.

The interest rates on the notes involved monthly installment obligations that were discounted in advance. The trial court found that &sect; 45-2007(f) violated Tenn.

However, the trial court erred in holding that the interest on the notes had to be computed at 10 percent per annum. The court held that the limited unconstitutionality of Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff alleged that the election code granted a monopoly to defendant and prevented plaintiff and other minority parties from attaining the status of statewide political party in violation of the state and federal constitution.

The court found that the code stated requirements for obtaining a ballot position for statewide office. The requirements were reasonable and did not discriminate against minority parties. The state and federal constitution did not deal with the requirements for listing candidates. Rather the constitutions dealt with the prohibition against testing for public office and the discrimination against individuals for voting purposes.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the funds used to retire the municipality's school bonds were not derived from the county school tax or any other funds allotted to the annual county school budgets. However, the court found that a county court was not authorized by law to apply the proceeds of a wholesale beer tax to the regular county school fund. The court remanded the case with directions to enter a permanent injunction restraining the county from further allocating the beer tax proceeds to the annual county school budget.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lienholders, five separate subcontractors and suppliers of a general contractor on a multi-building apartment complex, advised the landowners of their lien claims and filed such notices at the county registrar's office. The landowners denied the validity of the liens and challenged part of the lien statutes, alleging that a publicly recorded liens restrained or materially diminished their ability to alienate or obtain credit on their property and constituted a cloud upon their title. The chancery court sustained the liens and permitted an appeal to the court on the constitutional issues. On review, the court affirmed the decision and found that the lien claims were small and that the landowners remained in possession of their property with complete freedom to lease or rent the property and receive income. Accordingly, the court held that the mechanics' lien statutes did not permit the deprivation of sufficiently significant property rights of the landowners without notice or hearing and did not offend either the federal or state constitutional due process provisions. Further, the procedural provisions of the statutes met due process standards under both constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two death-penalty cases, the court issued its opinions vacating the death sentences and remanding the cases to the trial courts (Tennessee) for new trials limited to the imposition of new sentences. Seven days after the release of the opinions, the Governor of the State of Tennessee commuted the death sentences of defendants to life imprisonment. A timely petition for rehearing was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State contended that the order of commutation substituted ab initio a judgment of life imprisonment in the cases at bar, rendering unnecessary and inappropriate remands for resentencing. The issue presented was the validity and effect of the executive action in commuting punishment from death to life imprisonment. The petition for rehearing was properly before the court because no final judgment had been entered in the cases and the death sentences had not been finally vacated at the time of the Governor's action. The court held that the commutations were constitutionally permissible and lawfully imposed. After commutation, the sentences had the same legal effect as though they had originally been pronounced for the commuted term. The court could not refuse to recognize the validity of the commutations. Life imprisonment was a less severe penalty than death, and defendants had no basis for complaint. There was nothing in the state's statutory or constitutional law or the decisions of the court requiring that defendants be given a second jury trial as to punishment under the circumstances presented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer produced equipment used in the process of electrolysis and conducted a school in another state for the training of persons to perform electrolysis. The manufacturer insisted that electrology was an ordinary occupation or livelihood falling outside the scope of state licensure or regulation. The trial court found in favor of the State board. It held that the regulation of electrolysis was within the police power of the State so that the State could enact legislation for the safety and health of its citizens. The testimony supported the reasonableness of the statutory requirements of exclusivity of occupation and of facilities. Most of the manufacturer's employees operated through beauty parlors, but always in separate, private quarters and all of the witnesses who testified in the case stated that the practice should be carried out in strict privacy, not only for the patient, but because of the exacting and tedious nature of the work required of the operator. Thus, the provisions of Tenn.

Acts 848 called for a limited constitutional convention and established the qualifications of delegates that could attend by invoking Tenn. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. Section 1 prohibited ministers of the gospel of any religion from being a delegate. The court reversed the judgment that found &sect; 1 violated the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment because it did not impede the free exercise of religion in either belief or action. Rather, the section affected a career or calling, but in no way did the ineligibility for service in the legislature restrict religious action. Also significant to the determination was that Baptists, Methodists, and Catholics far outnumbered other religions therefore ministers of those faiths had a distinct advantage in winning elections. The court observed that ministers must do everything in their powers to further their religion's aims, and that if they were delegates their advocating and voting for legislation could violate the free exercise and establishment clauses.

The jury doubled the minimum 10-year sentence for armed robbery, and the trial court enhanced the sentences by decreeing that they run consecutively, resulting in defendants serving a 40-year sentence. While defendants' appeal was pending, the court held that &sect; 40-2707 was unconstitutional because its body was broader than its caption. On appeal, the court determined that because defendants' appeal was pending when the court declared &sect; 40-2702 unconstitutional, their convictions had not become final and the decision was applicable. The court further ruled that even though defendants did not argue that &sect; 40-2702 was unconstitutional for the reasons found by the court, they had properly made an assignment of error in the trial court. The court concluded that defendants were entitled to a remand on sentencing because they properly invoked the rule set forth in the court's opinion. The court also ruled that the trial court properly imposed consecutive sentences as to one defendant because he was shown to be a persistent offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reduced defendants' sentences to ten years, and as thus reduced, the court affirmed their convictions. The court ruled that the reductions were subject to the State's consent. The court held that if the State did not consent, the cases would be reversed and remanded for a new trial, and if the State consented, the cases were to be remanded for the trial court to consider whether to impose consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to the authority granted by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-165 (1968), the city passed an ordinance that implemented an inspection fee on licensed retailers of alcoholic beverages of five percent of the wholesale price of alcoholic beverages supplied by a wholesaler. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 67-5801 (1972) et seq., provided for the collection of a privilege tax on alcoholic beverages. The association consisted of retail liquor dealers. The court determined that the fee was not a tax because its purpose was for the regulation of an activity under the police power of the legislature. Thus, there was no merit to the association's contention that &sect; 67-5801 (1972) repealed Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 57-165 (1968) by implication because the former was to be the exclusive ad valorem tax and was not in lieu of inspection fees. The court ruled that the fee did not violate the export-import clause of the federal constitution because the tax was never levied upon the wholesaler. Affirming, the court held that the fee and privilege tax were valid, and had not been preempted by a wholesale liquor sales tax act that was directed toward a different area of liquor traffic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deputy beat the arrestee en route to the county jail. The arrestee obtained a judgment against the deputy in federal district court in a 42 U.S.CS. &sect; 1983 action and then filed an action in the trial court against the County to collect the judgment. The County, in turn, filed a third-party claim for indemnification against the bonding company. The court ruled that the trial court properly dismissed the action against the bonding company based on Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-832, which provided that neither the sheriff nor his surety were liable for acts of a deputy sheriff. Noting that &sect; 8-832 was in conflict with Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-1920, which made sureties liable on official bonds for wrongful acts committed by public officers, the court ruled that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 8-832 was controlling. The court also ruled that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 8-332, 8-333, 8-834 were not unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the arrestee because the County, which had not been a party in the federal district court action, had a right to deny liability for a judgment against the deputy on the basis of the statutory defense of willful misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant petitioned for writ of certiorari to review a judgment from a trial court (Tennessee), which convicted him of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree and sentenced him to death. In a second case, the State petitioned for writ of certiorari to review a judgment from the Court of Criminal Appeals, which held Tennessee's death penalty statutes unconstitutional and thus set aside a second defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Certiorari was granted in both cases primarily in order that the Court might consider the constitutionality of the death penalty under existing state statutes. The court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. The court held that the mandatory death penalty of 1974 Tenn. Pub. Acts 462 was not distinguishable in any meaningful or significant way from the statutes of other states that had been invalidated by the United States Supreme Court on the ground that they violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because the statutes did not give the sentencing authority &quot;controlled discretion.&quot; The court, therefore, declared the 1974 Act as unconstitutional and set aside the death sentences. The court held that setting aside the sentences had the effect of reviving the law prior to 1973, insofar as punishment was concerned. The court held, however, that the pre-1973 statutes, like the 1974 Act, did not prescribe sufficiently detailed procedures to accomplish &quot;controlled discretion&quot; by the jury in the imposition of the death penalty. Thus, the death penalty provisions contained therein were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the first defendant's convictions. The court, however, set aside the sentences in each case and remanded both cases to the respective trial courts from which they originated for a resentencing hearing, with punishment to be fixed in each case from 20 years to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that because sections 5, 6, and 7 limited, restricted and diminished the pension rights, benefits and privileges of the judges, the sections were null and void. Defendants, Tennessee Consolidated Retirement Systems, its Board of Trustees, and the attorney general, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judges alleged that, as voluntary contributing members of their pension plan, they each acquired contractual rights that the state could not deny them. The judges alleged that 1975 Tenn. Pub. Acts 315 deprived them of property without due process, constituted retrospective laws impairing contractual obligations, and diminished the amount of the judges' compensation during the time for which they were elected. Defendants alleged that the statute was a valid exercise of the legislature's continuing power to amend and modify the retirement benefits of state judges and that the Chancellor erred in holding that the statute violated the judges' constitutionally protected rights. The court held that the retired judges entered into a contract with the state that was fully performed at the time the judges retired. The court held that, because the statute reduced the benefit base for calculating the pensions, the statute impaired the retired judges' contract with the state. The court held that to the extent that the statute reduced the benefit base for the judges who were currently in office, the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The sales were made and the drugs transported in appellant's car. Twenty-one days later appellant was arrested for the drug sales and his car was seized while parked in the carport at his home, without legal process authorizing its seizure. On appeal from dismissal of his petition for certiorari, appellant argued that the seizure of his car violated the Tennessee and United States Constitutions and that the wrongful seizure deprived the State of the right to forfeit the car under the Drug Control Act. The court held that (1) Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1443(b)(4), which allowed seizure of property subject to forfeiture, authorized a seizure without a warrant, upon probable cause, only when exigent circumstances existed to justify the summary seizure; (2) there were no exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless seizure when the officers had a period of 21 days following its use in violation of the Drug Control Act within which to obtain a warrant; and (3) the unlawful seizure did not affect the trial court's jurisdiction to proceed in the forfeiture action, providing grounds for forfeiture were established.</SPAN></P>

The relator did not appeal from the judgment issued in that proceeding. Instead, the relator argued that the court should render an opinion on the constitutional issues that he raised. The State asserted that the appeal of the judgment in the habeas corpus proceeding was rendered moot by the relator's release from custody. In affirming, the court noted that the purpose of a writ of habeas corpus was to free one unlawfully imprisoned. It was not for use as a substitute for appeal. The court distinguished another ruling wherein that petitioner was permitted to maintain a habeas corpus proceeding because she was subject to a &quot;constructive confinement.&quot; In the action at bar there was no constructive confinement of the relator, and he was not subject to summary confinement in the peace warrant proceeding. The court declined to determine the constitutional issues because the lower court upheld the statutes that the relator attacked and there was no public interest sufficient to warrant review of those issues that had become moot to the relator.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion, finding that the warrants were constitutionally invalid in that they were general warrants and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3016(A) was unconstitutional in that it allowed the district attorney general or his representative the power to make an on-the-spot determination whether or not material was obscene and therefore subject to seizure.

The court concluded that the phrase &quot;in the opinion of the district attorney general or his designated representative&quot; that was contained in &sect; 39-3016(a) could be stricken from the statute under the doctrine of elision in order to preserve the continuity of the statute and spare it from constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a challenger of licensing for surveyors, sought review from a decision of a chancery court (Tennessee), which upheld the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 62-1801 et seq. and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 64-2418. Those statutes created appellee, the Tennessee State Board of Examiners for Land Surveyors, and required the licensure and annual registration of persons engaged in the business of land surveying.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challenger alleged that the State did not have authorization to require licensure of surveyors because land surveying was such a common occupation or business as to fall outside the scope of licensure by the State under its general police power. The court disagreed. The court determined that the practice of land surveying, as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 62-1801 et seq. and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 64-2418 did affect the public interest and was an activity that could validly be regulated by the General Assembly. The challenger failed in his burden to show that the statutes in question were vulnerable to his constitutional attacks. The challenger failed in his opportunity to introduce evidence in support of his contention that the practice of land surveying was such a common pursuit or calling as to be beyond the police power of the legislature and of its power to require registration and licensure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a workmen's compensation claimant, sought review from a judgment of the Chancery Court at Knoxville (Tennessee), which determined that the claimant did not suffer disability as a result of an occupational disease which was compensable within the scope and meaning of the Tennessee Workmen's Compensation Law. Appellee was the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A federal administrative agency had made a determination that the claimant was, for purposes of receiving &quot;Black Lung&quot; benefits, totally disabled. The claimant argued that in the subsequent state proceedings under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 50-1102, proof as to his receipt of &quot;Black Lung&quot; benefits under the federal administrative proceeding, combined with a finding that the claimant was subjected to work under a dusty environment for his last employer, established conclusively the claimant's right, under the State Workmen's Compensation Law, to recover total disability benefits from the insurer. The court did not agree that &sect; 50-1102 required such an interpretation. The court determined, however, that the Chancellor's opinion contained no indication as to whether the requirements of the applicable federal statutes and regulations were considered in reaching the determination. The court found that it was the intent of the legislature that the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-173, be adopted as the law in Tennessee. Moreover, certain medical files were not in the record. Under the circumstances the court concluded that complete justice could not be obtained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further consideration by the Chancellor. Upon retrial either party could introduce supplemental or additional medical testimony concerning the claimant's disability in order to enable the Chancellor to make appropriate findings and conclusions under the federal statutes and regulations which had been incorporated into the state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner solicitor sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeals, Western Section (Tennessee), which denied his appellate petition of a final judgment of the trial court in which she claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a stay or continuance of a hearing on a post-trial motion and of all other proceedings in a suit against respondents for specific performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The solicitor, a member of the Tennessee General Assembly, filed an action against respondents for specific performance regarding a parcel of land. Final judgment entered against the solicitor. A timely motion for post-trial relief was filed. Although counsel for the solicitor filed a motion under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 20-1106 to stay the proceedings until the Tennessee General Assembly adjourned, the solicitor appeared and argued his motion, which was overruled. The trial court appointed a receiver to rent or lease the land. When no appeal was perfected from the order overruling a motion for a new trial, a writ of possession entered for respondents. The solicitor's counsel filed a petition for certiorari and supersedeas in the appellate court, which found the petition to be without merit, but held &sect; 20-1106&nbsp;unconstitutional. On further appeal, the court held that the constitutional issue need never have been reached. The court noted that regular methods of seeking appellate review were available, including the suspension of the final judgment by the filing of a proper appeal bond and, if necessary, special protective orders from the appellate courts pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 62.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment by reversing and vacating so much of the appellate court's opinion as dealt with the validity of the Tennessee statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff attorneys filed suit in the Chancery Court at Chattanooga (Tennessee) against defendants, supreme court and the attorney general, seeking a declaration that so much of Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 42 as purported to levy a tax or license fee on plaintiffs or to suspend them from the practice of law be declared unconstitutional and that defendants be enjoined from imposing the tax or fee. The court addressed the chancery court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Tennessee Supreme Court promulgated Rule 42, which established a comprehensive disciplinary procedure to be funded and maintained by an annual license fee payable by members of the bar. A group of practicing attorneys filed a suit in the chancery court asking that so much of the rule as purported to levy a tax or annual license fee on the attorneys or to suspend them from the practice of law be declared void and that the supreme court and the attorney general be prohibited from imposing the tax or license fee. The court ordered the chancery court to dismiss the suit. The court held that the chancery court could not entertain any suit or action challenging the validity of a supreme court rule because such a suit would be in the nature of a bill of review or to impeach a judgment of the court and, in effect, would constitute an appeal to the chancery court from an action of the court. As a lower court, the chancery court was bound by decisions of the court. Further, the court had the authority to make rules governing the practice of law. The proper procedure for challenging the rule was to petition the court to vacate or modify the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered and directed the chancery court to enter an order of dismissal, taxing all costs to plaintiffs. It directed that all pleadings in the cause be delivered to the clerk of the supreme court and indicated that it would treat the pleadings as constituting a motion to vacate or modify the rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, co-petitioners, and the State of Tennessee filed petitions to rehear after the court held that 1973 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 163, &sect; 2, which appeared as the last paragraph of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2707, was unconstitutional and void, affirmed petitioner's and co-petitioners' convictions, affirmed petitioner's sentence, and reduced co-petitioners' sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the court rendered its original opinion, petitioner, co-petitioners, and the State filed petitions to rehear. The court sustained the State's petition as to its claim that the proper relief in the original opinion should have been a remand only for a determination of punishment. Further, as the State had an equal right with petitioner and co-petitioners to have a jury fix the term of imprisonment, the court modified its original opinion so as to provide that if the State did not consent to the reduction of co-petitioners' sentences to the statutory minimum for their respective offenses, their cases would be remanded for a new trial solely on the issue of punishment, in accordance with Tennessee case law. Moreover, the court operated on the basis of error assigned for its consideration. It had neither the duty nor the disposition to search the record and decide cases and controversies on the basis of unassigned error. Thus, petitioner's motion to rehear was overruled. Finally, the fact that a trial judge, prior to the release of the original opinion, might have charged the jury on parole considerations under &sect; 40-2707 did not necessary mean that the error was reversible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court clarified the range of co-petitioners' reduced sentences and the proper remedy on remand. Petitioner's motion to rehear was overruled. Finally, the court modified its opinion as to the proper procedure for determining co-petitioners' sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband's complaint stated that he was divorced by the wife and that he was ordered to pay the wife alimony in a trial court.

The husband alleged that the Tennessee alimony statutes discriminated against husbands as a class and that the alimony statutes were unconstitutional. The court affirmed the chancery court's judgment that dismissed the husband's action. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1103 of the Declaratory Judgment Act provided that any person whose rights, status, or other legal relations were affected by a statute was able to obtain a construction of the statute and a declaration of rights. In order to invoke the Act, the husband was required to allege facts that he was seeking to vindicate an existing right under existing facts. The husband failed to allege that he requested alimony or that he was denied alimony because of his gender. Pursuant to Tenn.

Their motion for a continuance based on a pending case that challenged the obscenity statute was denied. They entered a plea of guilty in accordance with a plea bargain. After final judgment was entered, from which defendants took no appeal, the obscenity statute was found to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The ruling applied retroactively. Defendants took no action in the trial court but filed a petition for writ of error in the appellate court. The appellate court denied the petition, holding that defendants implicitly waived the right to appellate review in the plea bargaining process. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendants knowingly dealt with the state on the strength of a statute whose constitutionality was being challenged, and they accepted the benefits of their plea bargaining, The regular method of review on appeal was precluded by the passage of time before the constitutional issue on which the appeal was predicated had ever matured. No supersedeas was ever sought in connection with the petition for writ of error. The judgment thus became fully executed by payment of the fine and by lapse of time.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with the chancellor, the determination of the constitutionality of the amendment was not necessary.

The court held that the board was a public body because its origin and authority came from state, city, or county legislative action and it had authority to make decisions on matters of policy. The court held that the board's free speech argument was without merit because the Act did not infringe of the board members' freedom of speech. The court held that the Act was not overbroad because all of the details of the Act were germane to the object expressed in its caption and were germane to one another.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of crimes and sentenced by the jury. The jury was charged with the duty pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 163 of the Public Acts of 1973, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2707, with determining defendants' parole considerations. Defendants appealed and contended that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2707 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendants' convictions, but vacated the sentences for two defendants. The court held that there was nothing whatsoever in the caption to alert any legislator or any interested citizen that tucked away into the Act would be a requirement that a judge charge a jury on parole considerations. Furthermore, the court held that where a title of an amendatory act recited the title of the act to be amended and also specified the amendments to be made, the legislation was limited to the amendment specified and anything in the body of the act outside of these was void. Finally, the court held that an act to amend a section of a previous act which contained subjects not expressed in the title of either the amending act or the original act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted of committing a crime against nature, a violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-707, by placing his mouth against the genital organs of a 14 year old female, forcibly, violently, and against her will. Petitioner appealed a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee, which affirmed a trial court judgment rejecting petitioner's insistence that his conviction could not stand because cunnilingus was not a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued that cunnilingus was not a crime at common law and was not specified as a forbidden act under &sect; 39-707, the crime against nature statute. The court addressed the narrow and limited issue of whether cunnilingus was a crime against nature as defined and prohibited by &sect; 39-707. In discussing whether the fair warning requirement of the Due Process Clause was met, the Supreme Court of the United States had previously held that Tennessee judicial opinions had given sufficiently clear notice that &sect; 39-707 applied to acts such as cunnilingus. Thus, the court held that &sect; 39-707 was not impermissibly vague under Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Finally, the court held that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-707 embraced the crime of cunnilingus. The court did not address the issues of whether &sect; 39-707 was overbroad, or whether &sect; 39-707 could be constitutionally applied to married persons or private consensual acts between adults. The court urged the legislature to reevaluate and modernize the crime against nature statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision, which had upheld defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

In an intervening petition, 13 bar members urged that the court organize the state bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bar association sought to have the court impose a mandatory annual license fee on each attorney licensed to practice law in the state. The purpose was to fund an office of investigative counsel, which was to consist of attorneys and support personnel to investigate complaints of unethical practices of lawyers referred to it by the executive committee of the bar association. The court granted the bar association's request and created an Office of Disciplinary Counsel. In so holding, the court declared Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-310 unconstitutional and found that the court had the inherent power to unify its bar. The court also adopted a new Tenn. S. Ct. R. 42 consisting of various rules of disciplinary enforcement that were filed with the bar association's supplemental petition. The court declined the 13 bar members' request to further unify or organize the bar, noting that, although other states used several different plans to structure their unified bars, no specific plan had been recommended to the court. Therefore, the court deferred consideration of this issue until such time as a commission could study the various types of plans that had been adopted in other states.</SPAN></P>

The court declined to further unify or organize the state bar but retained the question under advisement and appointed a commission to study the issue.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (Tennessee) determined that &sect; 7-147(4) was unconstitutional, and dismissed the appeal without discussion of the assignments of error. The surviving spouse sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the national guardsman was killed in an automobile accident en route from his home to a scheduled military drill. The court further found that the board of military officers determined that decedent met his death in the line of duty. The board of claims approved the surviving spouse's claim for benefits, but required her to execute a subrogation agreement, providing for reimbursement to the state of part of any amount recovered from a negligent third party. The surviving spouse signed the agreement under protest, and brought the appeal under &sect; 7-147(4). The lower court found that the statute that authorized judicial review was unconstitutional, as representing invidious class legislation. The court disagreed, holding that &sect; 7-147(4) was enacted within the scope of the legislature's very broad authority in enacting special procedural provisions applicable to national guardsmen. Additionally, the court held that the board of claims did not have standing to attack the constitutionality of the statute because it was not an aggrieved party. Finally, the court upheld the board of claims' right to subrogation, and affirmed the board of claims' determination.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the effect of the decision that declared ch. 192 void was to leave Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2402 unaffected. The evidence admitted under the indictments supported the jury's finding that defendant was guilty because he shot and killed two victims who were not attempting to shoot at him.

On appeal, the court reversed the decree of the chancellor. The court held that the charter provision was unconstitutional and void to the extent it contemplated the appointment of a clerk to handle metropolitan warrants and procedures because the Metropolitan General Sessions Court was one of the &quot;Inferior Courts holden in the respective Counties,&quot; within the meaning of Tenn.

The court further held that the provision effectively restored a two-clerk system to the county, with the criminal clerk responsible for the criminal court part and the metropolitan clerk handling civil cases.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The theaters were showing motion picture films that were alleged to be obscene.

Following appeals, the cases were consolidated, and the court affirmed the trial courts' judgments, holding that the Act was constitutional in all respects. The Act clearly required scienter in the sense in which it was demanded by the First Amendment. The definitions complied with the applicable standards of substantive due process. The theaters were not privileged to refuse production of the films because the films were not held for private use. The films were held for exhibition to the public, and the theaters did not prove that the films belonged to them. The Act's blending of criminal and civil sanctions did not violate principles of equity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was determined to be a juvenile. He first went to an institution and was then released to home placement status. The placement status was terminated by an ex parte order of a juvenile court. Petitioner then filed his action. The State agreed that the revocation without a hearing violated petitioner's constitutional rights. However, the State did not agree that petitioner had the right to counsel. On appeal, the court favored by sides in part. The court rejected the argument that the revocation proceeding was a continuation of the original delinquency proceeding so that the revocation was similar to a resentencing with the right to counsel. The revocation was in no way a new finding of delinquency. However, the court did not hold that there was no right to an attorney at all. Each case had to be decided on its own facts with any doubts in favor of the appointment of counsel. As noted, revocation was not resentencing so that the revocation was not an original proceeding where the burden of proof was &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; The standard was the &quot;preponderance of the evidence,&quot; and a juvenile was not entitled to a higher standard.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled a new trial motion because it contended that 1973 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 192, the sentencing statute, was unconstitutional because the body of the Act was broader than its caption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury was instructed at trial to sentence defendant to not less than 10 years if guilty. That was the old minimal punishment. However, the Act set the minimum at three years and was signed into law just a week before the trial court instructed the jury. The trial court was not aware of the new punishment. Defendant filed his new trial motion, arguing that the jury should have been instructed under the new punishment. However, the trial court reasoned that because the Act was void, there was no error in the jury instruction. Eventually, the state supreme court held the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the trial court ruled correctly. The court first found that a trial court had full authority to rule on a constitutional question when it was a necessary issue of the trial. Second, it was necessary for the trial court to decide the issue because sentencing was critical to the charge. Third, the trial court could have acted sue sponte. Further, the Act was void rather than merely voidable. Next, the court found that new legislation restored the 10-year penalty so that any confusion was remedied.</SPAN></P>

The pastor appealed the ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pastor contended that snake handling and strychnine drinking were a legitimate part of his church's religious service, protected by the U.S. Const. amend.

Code Ann. &sect; 39-2208 as a common law public nuisance. In so holding, the court found that 1) the pastor's church was a constitutionally protected religious group; 2) the right to the free exercise of religion was not absolute and unconditional, and it did not include the right to violate the law; 3) in order to restrict the free exercise of religion, the state's interest must be compelling, and the danger must be clear and present and so grave as to endanger paramount public interests; 4) Tennessee's Snake Handling Statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2208, was not controlling; 5) handling snakes as part of a religious ritual was a common law nuisance, independent of any statute; 6) the state had a substantial and compelling interest in the face of a danger so grave as to justify a complete injunction of religious snake handling.</SPAN></P>

In doing so, the court held that the plea in abatement should have been heard on the issue of systematic exclusion of blacks from the grand and petit juries. The court also held that defendant was tried by a fair and impartial jury, and that without foundation defendant accused jurors, the court reporter, court attendants, and trial judge of racial prejudice. The court also held that the evidence abundantly sustained the verdict of guilty because the wife positively identified defendant as the man who assaulted her and killed her husband, and defendant was found with the fruits of the crime soon afterwards.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, however, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and dismissed the case. Specifically, the court rejected the contention by the liquor dealers that the Act was contrary to the provisions of Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 since there was no reference in the caption to the amendments to the taxing provisions of the former statutes and that, thus, the text or body of the Act was broader than its caption. Instead, the court held that, in this situation, it was clear that the primary and overriding purpose of the Act was to repeal former pricing statutes on alcoholic beverages. Thus, the court noted that the Act only had a single purpose and dealt with only a single subject. Furthermore, the court held that there was no inconsistency with the provisions of the Act and that the court did not believe that the Act, taken as a whole, dealt with two different or separate subjects as contemplated by the Tennessee Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers were motor vehicle carriers that operated in the state. The commission assessed ad valorem taxes for the taxpayers and included in the assessment the value of the vehicles leased by the taxpayers. The board reviewed and approved the assessments. The taxpayers filed a petition for certiorari to the trial court. The trial court held that the assessments were illegal and void, concluding that the commission did not have the authority to include leased vehicles in the ad valorem assessment of the taxpayers. The commission and the board appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that there was no evidence that the assessment resulted in double taxation of any properties. The court refused to rule that the taxing power of the state did not encompass the assessment of leased equipment operated by a carrier in the exercise of its franchises in the state and upon the highways of the state. The court found that the property was taxed ad valorem, and the respective owners of interests therein may have by contract distributed the burden thereof among themselves.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated action, the landowners and the tenants sought review of judgments of the trial courts. One trial court held that Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 28(c) was violated when it created a classification of residential property containing two or more rental units as commercial property. The other trial court held that such classification was not unconstitutional. The court held that the constitutional provision was specifically amended to provide that residential property containing two or more rental units was to be defined as industrial and commercial property. The court determined that the legislature had the delegated authority from the people to limit and define the scope and action of the constitutional convention, under Tenn. Const. art. 11, &sect; 3. The court found that it was bound to indulge every reasonable presumption of law and fact in favor of the validity of a constitutional amendment after it had been ratified by the people. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which declared the classification unconstitutional and affirmed the judgment of the other trial court, which held that such classification was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the sale of the product occurred prior to the enactment of the 1969 amendment to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 28-304, petitioners alleged that, pursuant to the 1969 amendment, the cause of action accrued on the &quot;date of the sale&quot; as opposed to the date of the injury. The court affirmed its earlier ruling that the cause of action accrued after the date of 1969 amendment on the date of injury or the discovery of the injury. Although the defective product was sold before May 20, 1969, the injury occurred after that date and the cause of action did not accrue until the injury occurred. Section 2 of the 1969 amendment was not applicable to the pending action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and again convicted of being an habitual criminal. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee decided all issues adversely to defendant; however, one member filed a dissenting opinion protesting the unfairness of using the same prior convictions to support a second habitual criminal conviction. Due to the dissent and because it was an issue of first impression in Tennessee, the court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of three offenses involving armed robbery and burglary in 1964. In 1973, defendant was convicted of armed robbery and of being an habitual criminal. The second count of the indictment charged defendant with being an habitual criminal on the basis of the same three convictions followed by the commission of a felony charged in the first count. Defendant attacked his second conviction as an habitual criminal, insisting that his first conviction as an habitual criminal operated to obliterate the three felony convictions upon which the present conviction was based; therefore, one conviction, instead of being his fifth conviction, became his first. The court found that defendant was asserting that he was entitled to commit two more felonies before he may be convicted again as an habitual criminal. The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment. The procedure did not constitute double jeopardy. The use of prior convictions as the basis for enhancing the penalty for a subsequent felony conviction, even though they previously had been used for such purpose on a prior habitual criminal conviction, did not violate U.S. Const. amend. V or Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Court of Criminal Appeals (Tennessee), which affirmed the trial court following defendant's second trial that approved the jury's verdict of not less than three nor more than 21 years for the offense of assault to commit murder in the first degree and not less than five nor more than 12 years on the first-degree burglary charge. Defendant's sentence in the second trial was greater than his sentence in his first trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's second trial, which followed the reversal of his first conviction, resulted in a higher sentence. An article in a local newspaper reported about defendant's first conviction and indicated that he was sentenced to 21 years and a day on the assault to commit murder in the first degree charge. Nine jurors admitted to reading the article during voir dire. The appellate court found that no vindictiveness was indicated by the jury verdict. Reversing in part, the court held that the jurors' knowledge of the prior jury's sentence was almost certain to have been a factor given some consideration, which provided a potential for vindictiveness. A juror with knowledge of the verdict and sentence of the prior jury was subject to challenge for cause. The failure to challenge for cause or to use available peremptory challenges generally precluded reliance upon the juror's disqualification on appeal. The jury's sentence on the assault to commit first-degree murder charge was tainted with an implication of vindictiveness. However, the jury's finding as to first-degree burglary was proper because the newspaper article contained no reference to that charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded the appellate court as to defendant's sentence for assault to commit murder in the first degree for the entry of a judgment pronouncing the same sentence as that in defendant's first trial or, alternatively, for a new trial. The court affirmed as to the jury's verdict on the first-degree burglary charge.</SPAN></P>
