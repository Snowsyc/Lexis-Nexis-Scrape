</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, on behalf of minor children, brought suit against appellee, the tortfeasor, and several insurance companies seeking declaratory judgment against three insurance companies involved that the children were insureds under the policies and were entitled to collect damages. The anti-stacking clauses in the policies were unambiguous, and were clearly displayed in the amendment. The law in effect when the policy was entered into governed the scope of coverage of an underinsured motorist claim. It was irrelevant whether there was &quot;inter-family&quot; stacking or some other type of stacking. The anti-stacking language in the policies was broad enough to cover this type of stacking. The constitutionality of a statute could not be determined in a declaratory judgment action unless the attorney general was served with notice of proceedings and given an opportunity to be heard. The excess clause was not applicable and the insurance companies owed coverage on a primary basis.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed summary judgment for appellees, concluding that appellees supported their motion by pointing out that appellants' counterclaim failed to advance facts supporting their claim and the lower court, therefore, did not err in requiring appellants to submit something more than mere conclusory allegations which did not set forth facts to support the claim; appellants failed to properly assert &sect; 1983 claim, as there was no evidence to show that the denial of the permit rendered their land devoid of all economically viable uses; and that appellants failed to allege that state remedies were inadequate to address the zoning permit issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, appellant applied for another variance from appellee Congress Township Board of Zoning (board). The variance was denied and appellant sued. Appellant failed to demonstrate unusual hardship because it made no effort during the three years to have the area rezoned and appellant knew of the zoning restrictions before it acquired the property. Therefore, the court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion by affirming appellee board's denial of the 1998 variance request. The court held that zoning restrictions used to preserve the character of a neighborhood were constitutional because appellee board's resolution was not clearly arbitrary and was substantially related to legitimate governmental ends. The court concluded that the appellees members of the board were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity from appellant's claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Therefore, the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of appellees on the complaint.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4123.411 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were self-insured Ohio employers for purposes of workers' compensation who participated in the Disabled Workers' Relief Fund (DWRF) maintained by appellee, the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC). The court rejected appellants' contention that there was a two-year limit on any back benefit award for DWRF claimants. The court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.411(C) was intended by the General Assembly to apply prospectively. Self-insured employers were currently responsible to reimburse the BWC for all past, present and future employees who were eligible for the DWRF regardless of when the claimant's right to receive benefits accrued.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.411(C) was not unconstitutionally retrospective, and did not bar current assessment to appellants of DWRF benefits accrued by claimants prior to 1986, nor prior to the two-year limitation of Ohio Rev.

Appellants then applied for a variance from the spacing requirements of Section 541.133, which was denied by the county zoning board. Appellants sought review of that decision. On appeal the court affirmed the ruling, holding that appellants failed to meet the criteria set forth in Section 810.041 and failed to establish any practical difficulties not of their own making. There was no evidence of any condition peculiar to the land making it impractical to impose the billboard spacing requirements in Section 541.133, and there was no evidence that other billboard applicants were not subject to the same spacing requirements.</SPAN></P>

The trial court conducted a sex offender classification hearing and found appellant to be a &quot;sexual predator.&quot; The trial court entered judgment accordingly, but appellant challenged the finding. The court affirmed and held, considering all relevant statutory factors, the finding that appellant was a &quot;sexual predator&quot; was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four Ohio Department of Public Safety agents visited plaintiff's tavern to investigate complaint of improper conduct consisting of nude dancers and drugs. Agents cited plaintiff for violating Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-1-52. At hearing, Ohio Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) found plaintiff violated statute and suspended plaintiff's liquor permit for 30 days. The trial court rejected plaintiff's challenges to evidence sufficiency and constitutionality of statute. Plaintiff appealed, contending the statute was overbroad and trial court erred in sustaining OLCC's order because it was not supported by substantial, reliable and probative evidence. The court, after reviewing record and applicable law, reversed, because OLCC hearing was inadequate; there was no reliable evidentiary review or considered review of circumstances necessary to fulfill requirements for a hearing. In addition, the court found the statute was overbroad and violated U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a refuse collection company, applied for a permit to expand its business into defendant village. Plaintiff's request was denied because municipal code only authorized three refuse permits, which had already been issued.

Defendant's motion to dismiss, which argued that plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies, was granted, and plaintiff appealed. The court held that because the defendant had already effectively denied plaintiff's application, plaintiff had no available administrative remedy. Under the exhaustion doctrine, plaintiff was not required to seek legislative action prior to filing suit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of felonious assault in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.11(A)(1). Appellant was sentenced to a five-year prison term. One year later, appellant filed for judicial release under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.20. The trial court held that because appellant was sentence to five years or more but less than 10 years, appellant was ineligible to apply for judicial release. Appellant sought review. The court held that &sect; 2929.20(B)(3), which required appellant to serve out at least five years of his sentence before applying for early release, was constitutional. Section 2929.20(B)(3) did not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect class. The court found that the statute applied to more serious violations; therefore, the statute withstood constitutional scrutiny.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision Stark County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) in a classification that found him to be a &quot;sexual predator&quot; and subject to the registration requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court summarily overruled appellants' arguments that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 subjected him to double jeopardy or was unconstitutionally vague. Court determined that appellant's claim of erroneous classification as a sexual predator was reviewed under manifest weight of evidence standard. Court concluded that trial court's conclusion that appellant should be classified as a sexual predator was supported by competent and credible evidence. Appellant next argued that &sect; 2950 violated the Ohio Const. art. I. Court refused to find Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950&nbsp;unconstitutional when Ohio Supreme Court already rejected serious challenges to its constitutionality. Appellant's final contention was that his classification hearing should have been held after his parole hearing so that state could not use the sexual predator label against him at his parole hearing. Court responded by pointing out that the law required the reverse order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision affirmed; sexual predator statute did not subject appellant to double jeopardy nor was it unconstitutionally vague. It did not violate the Ohio Constitution. Trial court considered factors mandated by statute in classifying appellant as sexual predator and classification hearing was statutorily required to precede parole hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned property in a subdivision that was zoned as single family residential.

However, after construction began, the certificate was revoked for non-compliance, and a subsequent new application was rejected. Appellee zoning board upheld the denial. The trial court affirmed the decision. On appeal, the court affirmed, reasoning appellant's property did not comply with set-back requirements of Portage Township (Ohio) Resolution &sect; 800.01(b), which pertained to corner lots, therefore, her request for a zoning certificate was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decision of the trial court was affirmed because the trial court's ruling on the set-back requirement was sufficient to affirm appellee's decision denying appellant's application for a zoning certificate, and because substantial justice was done to appellant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was on the scene as a witness. Police investigation revealed that appellant's car, another Firebird, had hit the Firebird before the accident. A police officer also found out that appellant was friends with the driver and passenger of the Firebird that was involved in the accident. Witnesses testified that the two Firebirds were drag racing prior to the crash and that they were side by side. An expert in accident reconstruction stated that the speed of the Firebird that was involved in the accident was 80 to 100 m.p.h. On appeal, the court found sufficient evidence that appellant was drag racing and speeding. The court also found sufficient evidence to support appellant's convictions for involuntary manslaughter because the crash occurred immediately after the contact between the Firebirds and the deaths were proximately caused by appellant's actions. With respect to appellant's sentence, the court concluded that the trial court failed to make the findings required by Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury verdict that found appellant guilty of two counts of involuntary manslaughter was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants, three insurers, after they were denied coverage for damages arising out of the wrongful deaths of their children in an automobile accident.

The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on their declaratory judgment action against the uninsured motorist insurer, except for the plaintiffs' constitutional claim, denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment against the remaining defendants, and granted those defendant's motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs and the uninsured motorist insurer appealed. The court found that because plaintiffs failed to serve the Attorney General of Ohio with a copy of the proceeding as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12, the trial court did not err when it granted summary judgment to defendants, because it did not have jurisdiction to render judgment. However, summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs was proper in the case of the uninsured motorist insurer, because the court had to liberally construe the policy in favor of plaintiffs and hold that they could make separate claims under the uninsured motorist policy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant paid plaintiffs $ 100,000 pursuant to the &quot;each person&quot; limit of the coverage. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the defendant insurer. On appeal, plaintiffs contended that the policy language could not permissibly limit their collective recovery to $ 100,000, and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 was unconstitutional because it endorses such a limitation. The court affirmed the summary judgment, holding that the law properly permitted insurance companies to contractually limit recovery of uninsured motorist benefits. The court further held that the law did not give the appellants of a meaningful right to a remedy, it only limited the amount of recovery to the policy, and did not limit the exercise of a discernable constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio), which classified him as a sexual predator in accordance with the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C). Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the sexual predator law and the adequacy of the trial court's hearing held prior to making the sexual predator determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an investigation and arrest, defendant was indicted on two counts of gross sexual imposition and one count of felonious sexual imposition. He pled to one count of gross sexual imposition and one count of simple gross sexual imposition and was sentenced. At the conclusion of a sexual predator hearing, the court classified defendant as a sexual predator. He appealed, challenging the evidence and arguing that the registration and notification requirements retroactively applied to him were void as a prohibition of the ex post facto laws. Judgment classifying defendant as a sexual predator was affirmed. Comparing the statutory factors with the record, the trial court ruled correctly. Defendant was a 49-year-old female impersonator with a prior conviction for gross sexual imposition involving a minor child; the subject victims were five and six; the offenses involved multiple victims; there was a pattern of predatory behavior involving children, and defendant was diagnosed with pedophilia and depression disorder. The court held that, based on prior case law, application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2950.09 did not violate state or federal constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment classifying defendant as a sexual predator was affirmed because the trial court determined by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses, and the retroactive application of the legislation was constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the Pickaway County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied his motions to dismiss an indictment and to suppress a statement, claiming that the criminal prosecution following the imposition of a bad time penalty for smuggling marijuana into prison placed him in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant received a ninety-day bad time penalty from the parole board and a nine-month prison sentence from the common pleas court for his part in the attempt to smuggle two marijuana cigarettes into a state detention facility. Separate institutions, in different branches of government, conducted the proceedings at different times and imposed different penalties. Each penalizing institution employed different rules of procedure, as well as different standards of proof. Therefore, the bad time proceeding against appellant was entirely separate from his prosecution in the common pleas court. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11, in substance, authorized the imposition of a new penalty for a new offense, while formally declaring the new penalty to be part of the original sentence. Appellant's ninety-day bad time penalty was a new period of incarceration imposed as punishment for the complicity charge and not part of the appellant's original prison sentence. While &sect; 2967.11 attempted to formally make bad time part of the original sentence, the purpose behind imposing bad time was to punish new criminal conduct that occurred after imposition of the original sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction and sentence in the lower court for complicity to smuggle drugs into prison was in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

However, as part of a plea agreement, appellee amended the charge to physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, in violation of municipal ordinance. Appellant pled no contest to the charge and trial court suspended appellant's driver's license. Appellant argued that his driver's license was suspended unconstitutionally, as the municipal ordinance under which appellant was sentenced conflicted with state law. Appellant also contended he was denied due process of law, as trial court did not advise him, prior to his plea, that his license would be suspended. Comparing the relevant municipal code with state statutes, court held the statutes were substantially equivalent, with both authorizing license suspension for an act constituting less than actually driving a vehicle. Thus, court held the municipal ordinance was not unconstitutional. Court then held that, although trial court failed to inform appellant of the license suspension penalty prior to appellant's plea, the failure was not reversible error, as appellant failed to show prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the birth of appellant's son, both appellant and the infant tested positive for cocaine. The human services department filed a complaint alleging that the infant was a dependent, neglected and/or abused child, and the trial court found that he was an abused child under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.031. The court held that an unborn fetus was a &quot;child&quot; for purposes of the statute's application. Appellant sought review of the decision, and the court affirmed. The statute was constitutionally applicable to a newborn with symptoms of illegal drug exposure, and &quot;custody,&quot; under the statute, included the status of a pregnant woman. Further, application of the statute to a prenatal drug abuse case was neither inconsistent with surrounding statutory provisions nor unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Numerous tests were administered, including a blood enzyme test, designed to detect enzymes released during a myocardial infarction. Appellant's test results were recorded on a printed form erroneously identifying the test's normal range, which led to a delayed diagnosis. Prior to trial in his medical malpractice action, appellant filed suit for injunctive relief and certification of a class action, seeking to require appellee to notify patients receiving the blood test of the form's error. Appellee moved to dismiss, contending that appellant lacked standing for injunctive relief and therefore to maintain a class action. Appellant challenged the trial court's order dismissing his suit. In affirming, the appellate court concluded that appellant lacked standing. Appellant had already been afforded the particular relief sought; he thus had no injury to redress and no standing for injunctive relief or for class representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Appellant sought review, maintaining that the conviction for escape could not stand under the statutes applicable to his parole. Finding that appellant's parole could not be considered &quot;detention&quot; under the controlling statutory law, court concluded that appellant's parole violations could not subject him to prosecution for escape under &sect; 2921.34. The terms and conditions of appellant's parole were not altered by the subsequent amendment to Code &sect; 2921.01(E), which redefined a parolee's relation with the state from being not under &quot;detention&quot; to being under &quot;detention.&quot; Court held that the amended &sect; 2921.01(E) could not operate retrospectively to substantively alter appellant's legal relation with the state. Thus, appellant's escape conviction was vacated. However, under &sect; 2967 of the Code, court remanded because appellant remained susceptible to further proceedings for his parole violations.</SPAN></P>

The court held the statute was constitutional under the Ohio State Constitution and the United States Constitution. The trial court's order finding appellant a sexually oriented offender was redundant since appellant was deemed a sexual offender by operation of law.

After several months, the parole board determined he had violated his parole and sentenced him to additional time under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.67. Defendant filed motion to terminate post-release control and the additional sentence imposed by the parole board. The court denied defendant's motion. On appeal, the court held the statute unconstitutional under both U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV and Ohio Const. Defendant had standing to bring the claim as his freedom was denied as a result of the statute. The court found that the statute failed to afford defendant his substantive due process rights as the state showed no compelling reason why defendant, after having served his time, was denied his legal right to be left alone. The court also found that the statute denied defendant procedural due process by denying him an opportunity to participate in the proceedings or challenge his accusers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to appellant's conviction on two counts of rape, trial court held a hearing in which it relied upon hearsay testimony of appellee's witness to classify appellant as a sexual predator under state law. Appellant argued that trial court erred in admitting the testimony and that the statute authorizing the hearing was an unconstitutional use of the state's police power. Applying controlling case law, court held state rules of evidence did not strictly apply to a sexual predator determination, as the hearing was not intended to determine appellant's guilt or innocence. As the hearsay testimony was sufficiently reliable, court held it was admissible. Court then held that collateral estoppel was not applicable to the hearing, as the precise issue of whether appellant was a sexual predator under state statutes had not previously been litigated. Examining the law authorizing the classification hearing, court held the law was a valid exercise of the state's police power and thus within the state's constitutional limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed, as trial court's classification of appellant as a sexual predator was based on clear and convincing evidence, and statute under which the hearing was authorized was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, claiming the calls involved parenting issues and reversal was necessary where the state failed to prove the crime's elements and defendant did not receive a fair trial. The reviewing court affirmed, holding that the charging statute made the content of the calls immaterial and that the statute was not overbroad. Defendant's acquittal motion was properly denied where the crime was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant had a fair trial where defendant's request for a bill of particulars was untimely, where a jury instruction on the defense of necessity was not required where there was no evidence to support the issue, and where the trial court's correction of a clerical error and supplemental jury charge was proper.</SPAN></P>

In a neglect case, the trial court ordered appellant not to use or possess alcohol during the pendency of the case and to obtain substance abuse treatment. Appellee state filed motions for contempt against appellant, alleging that appellant violated the no-alcohol order and failed to complete substance abuse treatment. The trial court found appellant in contempt and ordered appellant to a program facility until she was admitted to an in-patient treatment program. Appellant sought review, claiming the court lacked authority to enter its no-alcohol order and that the contempt order was invalid where it was for an indefinite period. The reviewing court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded, holding that where the no-alcohol order served the best interest of appellant's children and reunification efforts, the trial court properly entered the order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a nightclub with a liquor permit holder, featured semi-nude dance performances. During an investigation, it was discovered that appellant allowed female dancers to expose their bare breasts and pubic areas. Appellant was charged by the Ohio Liquor Control Commission with violation of Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 4301:1-1-52, and it was ordered to pay a forfeiture or serve a six-day suspension. The trial court upheld the decision of the Ohio Liquor Control Commission. On appeal, the court determined that the regulation was unconstitutional for being facially overbroad. The court asserted that the regulation swept within its prohibitions a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech and expressive conduct such as the showing of a film, the singing of a song, or performance of an interpretative dance that dealt with sexuality. The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order affirming liquor suspension judgment was reversed. The court held that although the state could prohibit liquor permit holders from allowing female dancers to expose their bare breasts, the regulation under which appellant was convicted, prohibiting improper conduct, was unconstitutional because it was facially overbroad and prohibited constitutionally protected speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants began dumping scrap tires on land that had previously been strip-mined.

At a subsequent hearing, the Ohio Environmental Appeals Review Commission (Commission) ruled in favor of appellee and appellants sought review. The court affirmed the decision of the Commission, finding that because nothing about case infringed on the rights of a suspect class, a rational relationship test applied. The court found that there was a legitimate government interest in regulating the dumping of tires given the potential for a fire hazard and that the scrap tires formed a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The court found that it was clear that the site did not comply with Ohio Admin. Code &sect; 3745-27-60(B).</SPAN></P>

The convictions were affirmed on appeal, despite numerous errors alleged by appellant.

Even though appellant had not been under arrest or in a custodial environment, the court noted that he had been read his Miranda rights. The court noted that appellant was educated, had voluntarily waived his rights, and had been informed that he could leave at any time. In addition, the court found that appellant had not been denied effective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to object to certain limiting instructions regarding certain inflammatory material because the defense counsel's failure to object was a tactical decision. Finally, the trial court did not err when it classified appellant as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with escape pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.34(A) after he failed to report to his parole officer as required by the conditions of his parole on a prior felony conviction for domestic violence.

On appeal, the court reversed because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.15(E) applied, which deleted the language excluding persons on parole from prosecutions for escape. The amendment to &sect; 2967.15(E) did not violate constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws and retroactive laws. Imposing a sentence for a new felony offense under the law in effect at the time of the new offense did not implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution or the retroactive-laws provision of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court reviewed the record in order to assess whether the trial court acted on clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to engage in one or more sexually oriented offenses in the future.

Further, such a restriction that singled out political signs from which to ban an entire mode of communication was subject to the strictest standard of review. It was clear from the record that plaintiff made no attempt to meet its burden under the strict scrutiny standard other than to allege concerns regarding aesthetics and traffic safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a decision finding defendant guilty of violating a city ordinance. The court explained that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it singled out political signs from which to ban an entire mode of communication and plaintiff failed to meet its burden to show that the harms the ordinance sought to address were real and that the ordinance would address these harms in a real and material way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State asserted trial court error in ruling that the documents and personal effects seized during the execution of a warrant at defendant's residence should be suppressed as evidence unrelated to the commission of a crime and overly broad. The trial court had concluded that the seized items of defendant's live-in boyfriend -- intended to be used to establish welfare fraud by defendant who claimed to live alone -- were the result of a warrant that allowed for an overly broad exploratory search. The court rejected the trial court's reasoning, explaining that under both constitutional law and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.21 search warrants for &quot;mere evidence&quot; of a crime were permitted, especially when supported by probable cause. While U.S. Const. amend. IV required warrants to be sufficiently definite, the court observed that the particularity requirement was met when the warrant restricted the seizure to items of defendant's friend. Thus, the court concluded, the exclusionary rule did not apply when the officers conducting the search acted in objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate even if subsequently determined to be invalid.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 10, nor the retroactivity clause of the Ohio Constitution, Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, applied to the portion of the statute defendant challenged, Ohio Rev. Code &sect;2950.09(C).

Appellee also denied permission and appellant pursued an administrative appeal to the lower court arguing that it was entitled to pursue the appeal under the provisions of Ohio Rev.

Both offenses involved a three-year-old girl. The felonious sexual penetration offense was merged with the rape offense for purposes of sentencing. A determination that appellant was a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C)(1) was affirmed. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 et seq. was clearly an exercise of the state's police powers. The statute confronted the danger posed by repeat sex offenders who represent a genuine threat to public safety. The statute bore a real and substantial relation to the legislature's legitimate goal of protecting the public. The registration and verification provisions had precedent, and registration had long been a valid regulatory technique. The address verification requirements were narrowly tailored to comport with the respective danger and recidivism levels of the different classifications of sex offenders. The prosecutor presented evidence of the nature of appellant's conduct which resulted in his conviction for sexually-oriented offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff advertiser appealed from the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) which overruled his appeal from defendant Board of Zoning Appeals' denial of several applications for permits to construct billboards, and overruled his motion for partial summary judgment with respect to an action for declaratory judgment against defendant city. Plaintiff asserted that his billboard signs were not barred by defendant's ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a billboard advertiser and had applied for sign permits. Defendant zoning board denied the permits and plaintiff filed suit after the trial court ultimately affirmed defendant board's decisions regarding the permits. On his appeal, plaintiff asserted various assignments of error from the trial court's decisions. On review, the court determined that it did not have jurisdiction over parts of the action where there was no final appealable order. As to the appealable matters, plaintiff asserted that, among other things, defendant board's interpretation of the zoning code was unconstitutionally arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable, and that his free speech rights were unconstitutionally infringed upon. On review, the court construed defendant city's ordinances most strictly against defendant board and found that plaintiff's signs were not proven to be commercial in nature and that the application of the size limitations placed on &quot;commercial advertising signs&quot; was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious. The court reversed in that regard and the court remanded the case with instructions for the defendant board grant the requested permits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision which affirmed the denial of plaintiff's permits was reversed because the restrictions upon which defendant zoning board relied were inapplicable to billboards. The case was remanded with an order that defendant board grant the requested permits. Otherwise, the legal decisions of the trial court were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of one count of non-payment of child support in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21(B). On appeal, he claimed that his incarceration during the charge period precluded conviction for failure to pay child support. He argued that if the time he was in jail was counted against him, he could conceivably be subject to a never-ending cycle of prosecutions with the cumulative effect of keeping him perpetually behind bars. The court disagreed, and it affirmed the ruling below. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2919.21(D) provided an affirmative defense to the charge of criminal non-support, thereby eliminating the possibility of perpetual incarceration where an incarcerated obligor was truly unable to pay an adequate amount of child support, despite making an earnest effort to do so. Accordingly, the statute, as applied to defendant, did not violate the equal protection clause of either the Ohio or United States Constitutions. The court concluded that the trial court had not created a manifest miscarriage of justice, either by not finding that defendant had established an affirmative defense, or by finding defendant guilty of violating the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for non-support despite his incarceration, where the statute invoked provided for affirmative defenses in cases where an effort to pay was made despite inability to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following criminal defendant's conviction for attempted rape, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery, the trial court conducted a sexual predator hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B). The trial court found that criminal defendant was a sexual predator based on his prior criminal record, involvement in sexual activity in an offense, and a demonstrated pattern of abuse. On appeal, the reviewing court affirmed. The court relied on precedent in summarily rejecting defendant's constitutional challenges to &sect; 2950.09(B). Further, the court held that old conviction data, which consisted of information available at the time of original sentencing, was sufficient to meet the state's burden. Finally, the state established by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was a sexual predator based on his history of kidnapping and abducting women on three separate occasions, the sexual nature of one offense, and his threats and engagement in cruel conduct towards his latest victim, which occurred within several months of the prior kidnap victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had adjudicated appellant a sexual predator on the finding that there was clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to reoffend. On review, the appellate court found that the record before the trial court was sufficient to meet the standard of clear and convincing evidence. The appellate court noted that the trial court was justified in its firm belief that appellant was likely to reoffend, given the fact that appellant's victims were young, that multiple victims were involved, and that the sexual offenses had continued over a long period of years, despite appellant's maturity of years. The appellate court further noted that the belief that appellant was likely to reoffend was supported by appellant's own testimony that he would reoffend if given the opportunity to do so. The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that the trial court had considered the statutory factors under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) and attended to the factors of multiple offenses, disparity in age between appellant and his victims, and appellant's own concern about his likelihood to reoffend in adjudicating appellant a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mother and daughter, were injured in a car accident. Appellants brought several claims for recovery against appellees, appellants' insurer and tortfeasor's insurer. Both appellees admitted coverage but cited statutory per person limitations upon liability, regardless of the aggregate of the various claims. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of appellees and denying summary judgment to appellants. On appeal, the court reversed and entered summary judgment for appellants against their insurer. The policy language was ambiguous and was thus construed in favor of appellants to allow recovery in excess of the per person limit of $ 50,000 under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(H). The court, however, affirmed the summary judgment granted to the tortfeasor's insurer because the policy language clearly allowed the limitation of recovery, including medical expenses, to a single per person liability limit under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44. &sect; 3937.18(H) and &sect; 3937.44 were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were involved in a motor vehicle accident with defendants. They sued to recover for personal injuries and loss of consortium beyond the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions. Defendants moved for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs maintained that the statute of limitations was tolled under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15 because defendants had been out of state for non-employment reasons and had vacationed out of state for 10 days during the two year period. The trial court found the tolling statute to be unconstitutional and granted summary judgment for defendants. The court affirmed the ruling that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15 was unconstitutional. It found that absences from the state for medical reasons or vacation did not toll the statute of limitations because such would constitute an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment for defendants on the loss of consortium claim because a claim for a loss of consortium was a derivative action for which there was a four-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Appellant wished to charge the client for the time he had expended and, after researching the issue, billed the client. The client filed a complaint.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that reliable and substantial evidence supported the commission's order. &sect; 4735.18 (A)(6) was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided adequate notice of proscribed conduct. Because the time period of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Delaware County Board of Commissioners (Board) denied petitioners' request for annexation of township property to the city of Columbus, based on testimony that fire and police services could not be provided to the proposed area. Following affirmance of the Board's decision by the trial court, petitioners appealed. The court reversed, and it granted the annexation request. The trial court improperly compared the level of services that could be provided by the township to those which could be provided by the city of Columbus. Comparison of services was improper, as the test was not what was best for the territory to be annexed, but what was for the general good of the territory. The trial court gave great weight to evidence presented by the township trustees concerning response times, which would potentially be shorter if services were provided by the township. That evidence, however, failed to support the conclusion that the provision of police and fire services would be inadequate. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.033, annexation was favored, and deference should have been accorded to plaintiffs' wishes.</SPAN></P>

V and Ohio Const. art.

XIV, and the comparable guarantee of Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the sentence imposed on him by the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) for aggravated vehicular homicide and also challenged the constitutionality of the &quot;bad time&quot; provisions of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was sentenced to the maximum sentence for aggravated vehicular homicide and driving under the influence (DUI). The trial court considered appellant's prior convictions, the great likelihood that he would commit future crimes, the statement of the victim's husband and sister, and the recommendations by the probation department in its decision to impose the maximum sentence. Because it imposed the maximum sentence, the trial court was required to specifically determine that appellant met one of the four categories and state its reasoning, on the record, for imposing the maximum sentence. The four categories the trial court was required to consider in determining appellant's sentence included: whether appellant committed the worst form of the offense, posed the greatest likelihood of committing future crimes, was a certain major drug offender, or was a certain repeat violent offender. The trial court stated that the maximum sentence was appropriate due to appellant's history of drug and alcohol abuse and the likelihood of repeating the offense. Thus, the court found that maximum sentence imposed was proper and therefore affirmed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was merely notified that he was subject to the &quot;bad time&quot; provision and had not yet suffered any actual imposition of additional time in prison pursuant to the bad time provision; therefore, he lacked standing to challenge constitutionality of the bad time provision in Ohio's statute. Thus, appellant's assignment of error was without merit and the sentence imposed by the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision from the Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which sentenced him to serve a definite term of incarceration of five years in a correctional institution following a determination that he had violated the terms of his probation. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.20(B)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.20(B)(3)&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated his due process rights because it negated the judicial release provisions for offenders sentenced to an exact prison term of five years. The court found that the statute did not violate appellant's right to substantive due process. The court reasoned that appellant had no constitutional right to be released from prison before the expiration of his sentence, and that substantive due process did not apply to appellant's claim because he had no liberty interest left to be protected. However, the court found that the statute violated the Ohio and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection under the law. The court reasoned that under the statute, any offender sentenced to less than 10 years, except for an offender sentenced to exactly five years, was eligible to apply for judicial release, and that because the statute involved neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class, the constitutionality of the law was subject to the rational basis test. The court concluded that unequal treatment of offenders sentenced to exactly five years was arbitrary and bore no relation to the state's goals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The court found the statute, which rendered offenders sentenced exactly to five years ineligible for judicial release before the expiration of their terms, violated the state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 16-year-old boy, appealed from the judgment of the trial court adjudicating him delinquent on one-count of discharging a firearm, in violation of a city ordinance, and ordering him to pay a $ 25 fine plus court costs. The appellate court held that the city and state laws that were germane to the matter did not conflict. Indeed, the relevant state statutes were silent on the issue of discharging an air or BB gun in certain public places. Thus, the court noted that the absence of any state legislation of such conduct demonstrated the lack of any conflict. Because no state statute expressly or implicitly authorized discharging such instrumentalities in a public place, a municipality prohibiting it created no conflict. Therefore, the court could not find that the city ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed because no state statute authorized discharging an air of BB gun in a public place and, therefore, no constitutional conflict was created by a municipality-prohibiting defendant from discharging such instrumentalities.</SPAN></P>

Counsel concurred that the court had fully and accurately informed appellant of all factors as required by law prior to sentencing. Nevertheless, appellant sought review alleging that the trial court had committed reversible error by failing to adhere to the sentencing guidelines set forth in &sect; 2929.13 and that it was unconstitutional to have imprisoned an Ohio citizen because the court essentially had imprisoned a person for being a judgment debtor. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and sentence because it found the sentence was reasonably calculated to achieve the purposes commensurate with the seriousness of appellant's conduct, the recidivism factors were inapplicable, and appellant failed to preserve the constitutional argument at the trial level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his municipal court convictions for driving under the influence, driving under suspension, and possession of drug paraphernalia upon his entry of a no-contest plea to the charges against him. Appellant claimed the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence on the grounds that the search of his vehicle was invalid because it was performed before the car was impounded. Appellant argued that an inventory search was justified only when the vehicle was secured in the station house, and thus the inventory search of the vehicle was unlawful. Appellant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to consider his motion in limine by which he requested the court to decide whether his refusal to submit to a breath alcohol test could be used against him at trial. The appellate court affirmed the conviction because a search conducted prior to impoundment was not per se illegal, and appellant's plea of no contest precluded him from challenging the denial of his motion in limine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions because appellant's vehicle was inventoried, towed, and impounded in keeping with the written departmental procedures and, absent allegations of bad faith, such inventory search conducted in accordance with standardized procedures was not a violation of his constitutional rights. The court also held that his plea of no contest precluded appellant from challenging on appeal the denial of his motion in limine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's automobile was seized and impounded when he was arrested for driving under the influence. Defendant pled guilty, and the trial court granted state's motion for forfeiture. State made necessary repairs to the automobile. Defendant withdrew his guilty plea and was acquitted of the charge. The trial court ordered defendant to pay the towing, storage, and repair charges for the automobile. The appellate court reversed the order.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.195, which permitted the court to order defendant to pay the charges, was unconstitutional as applied to defendant because it denied defendant's due process rights under the Ohio and United States Constitutions. Defendant's private interest in the use of his automobile was substantial, and the risk of erroneous deprivation was high. Although the state had a compelling interest in protecting the public by removing persons who operated automobiles while intoxicated, because of the lack of a direct effect on public safety, defendant's private interest outweighed the state's interest.</SPAN></P>

His conviction of involuntary manslaughter was predicated on speeding, a minor misdemeanor traffic offense. Over two months later, new counsel for appellant filed motions to dismiss the indictment, to arrest judgment, or, in the alternative, to withdraw appellant's no contest pleas. Appellant asserted that the indictment against him subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The trial court denied the motions. The appellate court affirmed holding that the punishment for involuntary manslaughter predicated on a minor misdemeanor was not so disproportionate as to shock the sense of justice of the community and did not violate appellant's right to be protected from cruel and unusual punishment. The court further found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow appellant to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrator sought review of an order from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted appellee tortfeasors' Ohio R. Civ. P. 9(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, on the ground that the trial court erred in holding that the savings statutes,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2125.04, 2305.19, did not extend the statute of limitations on appellant's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrator filed her wrongful death claims within the limitations period, took a voluntary dismissal within the limitations period, and then refiled the lawsuit after the statute had run, but within a year from the time of her dismissal. Holding that the savings statutes,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2305.19, 2125.04, only extended the time for filing if the statute of limitations had already expired, the court affirmed the judgment for appellee tortfeasors. For authority, the court cited the statutes' plain language, to the effect that if the time limited for the commencement of the action at the date of dismissal had expired, the plaintiff could commence a new action within one year after such date. The court held further that appellant's constitutional challenges to the savings statutes failed. For equal protection and due process purposes, the statutes had a rational basis for their discriminatory scheme. The basis was simply that a plaintiff whose case terminated not on the merits or was reversed before the statute had run did not need a savings statute to refile the case, but a plaintiff whose case similarly ended after the statute had run did need a savings statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of judgment on the pleadings for appellee tortfeasors. The savings statutes relied on by appellant administratrix only extended the time for commencement of an action if, at the date an action was terminated not on the merits, the limitations period had already run. This criteria for determining who obtained the benefit of the statute had a rational basis, so the statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was indicted by a grand jury on one count of trafficking in cocaine, with a property forfeiture specification. The indictment stemmed from allegations that appellant sold $ 250 worth of cocaine to a police informant. The sale allegedly occurred inside appellant's home. Appellant also had a prior conviction for aggravated trafficking that involved the sale of drugs at his home. Defendant pleaded guilty, and the trial court ordered the forfeiture of the property, valued at $ 31,470. Appellant argued on appeal that the forfeiture of his property was an excessive fine, grossly out of proportion to the offense that he committed. The court held that the forfeiture of appellant's residence was not so grossly disproportionate as to violate the Excessive Fines Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Because appellant had not yet been subject to additional prison time or post release control sanctions, he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the bad time provision contained in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2967.11 or the post release control concept set forth in &sect; 2967.28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that ordered the forfeiture of appellant's real property was affirmed. The court found that the forfeiture of his residence was constitutional because of the home's use for multiple drug sales within a short period of time and the fact that this was appellant's second trafficking conviction that involved his home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. Appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief. Appellant contended that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of counsel's failure to present additional mitigation evidence concerning his mental illness, and that imposition of a death penalty on a person who was mentally retarded was cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court held that an evidentiary hearing was not necessary to determine the issues that appellant raised in his petition, and dismissed the petition. Appellant contended that the trial court was in error for adopting nearly verbatim the findings of fact and conclusions of law proposed by the prosecutor and by dismissing his causes of action without evidentiary hearing or discovery. The court determined that the trial court could adopt the prosecution's proposal where appellant was not prejudiced by such adoption. The court asserted that appellant's allegation of mental illness did not constitute legitimate new evidence.

The trial court had a hearing in which an expert testified that the child was anxious to be adopted and that the adoption could be in the best interest of the child. The court granted appellee's petition. On appeal, appellant contended that the witness did not question appellant before submitting her assessments, that the children had suffered parental alienation syndrome, and that the best interest of the child would not be served by the adoption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The classification of sexual predator entered against defendant was affirmed. Defendant was convicted of one count of rape and three counts of gross sexual imposition. Defendant challenged the trial court's determination to classify defendant as a sexual predator under Ohio. Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. Defendant assigned nine errors that challenged the constitutionality of the sexual predator statute and the sufficiency of the evidence used to establish that defendant was a sexual predator. The court determined that the constitutionality of the sexual predator statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, had already been established. Although the transcript of the court proceedings was not available, the court determined that substantial evidence supported defendant's classification as a sexual predator. Defendant had been convicted of multiple counts of sexually oriented offenses. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in classifying defendant as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that classified defendant as a sexual predator. The court denied defendant's challenges to the constitutionality of the sexual predator statute and determined that although no transcripts were presented to the court, the evidence was sufficient because the record demonstrated that defendant was convicted of multiple counts of sexually oriented offenses.</SPAN></P>

Concluding that aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, Portage County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) sentenced defendant to death on the aggravated murder charges. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After breaking into an elderly couple's home to rob them of their social security checks, defendant shot and killed the couple. Jury convicted defendant of two counts of aggravated murder with aggravating circumstances, two counts of aggravated robbery, and one count of aggravated burglary. Following jury's recommendation, the trial court imposed a sentence of death for the aggravated murder charges. Defendant appealed. Rejecting each of the fifteen assignments of error raised by appellant, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and death sentence. First, evidence supported the finding of the aggravated circumstances of which defendant was found guilty. Specifically, the aggravated murders took place while defendant was committing aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary, and defendant was the principal offender in the commission of the murders. Moreover, the second aggravated murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, or punishment. Next, the mitigating factors of defendant's age and background did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances. Finally, the sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant's fifteen assignments of error lacked merit, court affirmed defendant's convictions for two counts of aggravated murder with aggravating circumstances, two counts of aggravated robbery, and one count of aggravated burglary. The court affirmed defendant's death sentence for the aggravated murder charges because sentence was proportional and mitigating factors did not outweigh the sufficiently proven aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 2969.25(C).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, then an inmate at a correctional facility, filed a complaint seeking to prevent defendant from transferring him from the facility to a prison in another state pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 5120.50. Defendant department of rehabilitation and corrections filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint, alleging that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that plaintiff failed to comply with the filing requirements of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2969.25 (C). The court found that plaintiff submitted a copy of a letter addressed to the county clerk of courts that he had mailed with his initial complaint, which requested that the clerk advise him of the amount of the filing fees. Subsequently, plaintiff paid the filing fee. The court held that while noncompliance with the statute provided grounds for dismissing an inmate's complaint, by actually paying the filing fees, plaintiff eliminated the need to comply with the requirements of that statute relating to waiver of the filing fee. The court further held that the trial court failed to address plaintiff's argument. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the trial court failed to address plaintiff's argument that the statute, even when complied with, was in violation of the state's constitutional provision prohibiting transfer of an inmate out of state for an offense committed within the state.

Based upon the evidence presented, the trial court found that defendant-appellant was a sexual predator as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E). Defendant-appellant sought review, arguing that the sexual predator statute was unconstitutionally vague, that it violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the retroactivity clause of the Ohio Constitution, and that the statute subjected him to double jeopardy. The court found that all of appellant's claims had been addressed in previous decisions. Citing precedent, the court held that the sexual predator statute was not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate either the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution or the retroactivity clause of the Ohio Constitution. Furthermore, the court held that because the sexual predator statute was not punitive in nature, it did not subject defendant-appellant to further punishment.

The court agreed and held that nudity, within the statute, referred to lewd photographs, not morally innocent photographs which happen to focus on the genitals. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant because the trial court erred when it held that lewdness was not a necessary element of nudity as the term was used in Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellants contended that Cincinnati Municipal Code &sect; 910-10 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court found that subsection (b) explicitly stated that it was prima facie unlawful for a person to cause from a motor vehicle a noise that is plainly audible from a distance of 50 feet or more. The court reasoned that this concrete and quantifiable measurement objectively narrowed the breadth of the ordinance and clarified the nature of the violation. The court concluded that, on its face, the ordinance was a constitutional exercise of the city's police power. Appellants also argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied because it impacted a disproportionate number of African Americans. The court stated that appellants offered insufficient evidence to show an intent to discriminate on the part of the government. The court also rejected appellants' due process challenge because although they claimed that a loud noise permit was issued for the park where their citations were issued, they failed to produce the permit. Finally, the state's evidence that appellants' car stereos were audible more than 50 feet from their cars was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, a state appellate court affirmed, holding that (a) sexual predator statute was not unconstitutionally vague, since as noted by controlling precedent, the mere fact that it required trial judges to make complicated decisions at sentencing hearings did not mean that it was vague; and (b) precision with which appellant videotaped and documented his sexual escapades with a minor female suggested that he intended to market his videotapes, and in any event supported the conclusion that he would have difficulty controlling his sexual impulses, thus making the sexual predator classification appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court affirmed a decision of a city's Board of Zoning Appeals (board) which granted an application for a conditional use zoning permit to operate a group home for young women in a residential neighborhood. The board relied upon a city council finding that there was a beneficial relationship between the proposed development and the neighborhood in which the home would be located. Appellants, who were residents of that neighborhood, challenged the trial court's decision by arguing that the city council's finding was unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. In construing that assignment of error as meaning that the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court held that &quot;benefit&quot; connoted a positive good. As there was evidence that the home would operate with controls on the behavior of its residents that were not present elsewhere with respect to other multi-family dwellings and that the home would be available for use by young women whose families resided in the city, the court concluded that there was some evidence which supported the trial court's findings. Thus, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant next argued that the determination that he was a sexual predator was not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The court noted that the prosecution did not satisfy all of the factors to be considered pursuant to &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) nor was it required to do so. The court found that defendant's persistent deviant behavior towards the child victim was proof that he was likely to commit one or more future sexually oriented offenses and that he should be adjudicated a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Loraine County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) which recognized that she was a sexually oriented offender as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.03 et seq., following an action brought by the state charging appellant with two counts of corruption of a minor, in violation of former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.04(A), and two counts of corruption of a minor in violation of current &sect; 2904(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two counts of corruption of a minor in violation of former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.04(A), and two counts of corruption of a minor in violation of current Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.04(A). Thereafter, a sexual predatory hearing was held and appellant was adjudged to be a sexually oriented offender pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04. Appellant challenged the independent sexual predator hearing and judgment. The issues were whether the court erred to appellant's prejudice because the trial court lacked jurisdiction, and further erred when it did not find the proceedings in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 et seq. unconstitutional under the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. The appellate court found the trial court added nothing by classifying appellant as a sexual offender and that she was not prejudiced by such classification because she in fact committed the underlying offenses. Also, the statutory labeling and registration requirements did not constitute criminal punishment in violation of her constitutional rights. Further, &sect; 2950 et seq. did not violate either constitution. Accordingly, the trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment labeling appellant a sexual offender pursuant to statute was affirmed because the court found sexually oriented offender duties were independent of sexual predator hearings and arose not by court order but by statutory imposition. Appellant's constitutional claims against the statutory imposed duties were without merit and did not violate prohibitions against equal protection, double jeopardy or cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that respondent agency's imposition of post-release control was not a component of the original sentence.

The court held that defendant's motion to suppress that evidence had been properly denied. Specifically, it held that the state had offered unrebutted evidence that the train was immediately approaching when defendant decided to move his vehicle across the tracks.

Plaintiff, an employee of defendant auto mall, was seriously injured as a result of an explosion at work. The court noted that, in order to prevail on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff was required to demonstrate that: (1) the defendant intended to cause him serious emotional distress; (2) the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; and (3) the defendant's conduct was the proximate cause of plaintiff's serious emotional distress. The grant of summary judgment to defendants was affirmed on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because, even when the evidence in the record was construed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, the actions of defendants did not constitute extreme and outrageous conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) denying defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and sentencing him to 10 and one-half years for fourth-degree inducing panic, fifth-degree assault while on school premises, and second-degree felonious assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and affirmed the sentence imposed on defendant. Defendant pleaded guilty to inducing panic, assault while on school premises, and felonious assault, and the court sentenced him to 10 and one-half years. Defendant appealed, arguing that the court should have granted his motion to withdraw his plea, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and that his sentence was excessive. The court first held that defendant knowingly entered his guilty plea and did not require withdrawal of the plea. The court also held that defendant's counsel did not fail to warn defendant of the consequences of his guilty plea. Further, the court held that defendant's sentence was not excessive because the trial court judge followed the statutory requirements for imposing sentences and that the determination made by the trial judge was supported by the record. Finally, the court held that the statute providing sentencing guidelines was not unconstitutionally vague. Therefore, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment granting appellee's motion for summary judgment dismissing appellants' claim for wrongful death was reversed. In reversing the trial court's decision, the appeals court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because Ohio Rev.

According to the appeals court, because the Ohio Supreme Court found Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01 to be unconstitutional as it was with odds with the Ohio Constitution section 2305.112 was also unconstitutional because it was enacted pursuant to section 2745.01. The appeals court then found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.02(D)(1), which provided two-year statute of limitations for torts was the applicable statute of limitation. Accordingly, the appeals court held that summary judgment was inappropriate because there were genuine issues of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner was convicted and sentenced to death after killing and wounding his former girlfriend's friend and family. Upon affirmation of the conviction and his death sentence, defendant petitioned for discovery and postconviction relief. Defendant appealed after these motions were denied. The court found that defendant had no right to conduct discovery in postconviction relief proceedings, and the petition was properly denied. Page limits under appellate rules were constitutional, because the court had inherent power to administer rules limiting appellate briefs to three pages, even in capital cases. Defendant had opportunity to concisely present all of his arguments, and was not denied due process. The court found that defendant's constitutional challenges to the judgment were raised prior to trial; thus, res judicata barred the court's further review of these issues. Defendant did not show that his trial counsel was ineffective merely because he used questionable trial tactics or because he did not find redundant mitigating evidence until after trial. Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to a hearing on any of his grounds for relief, and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

At a sexual predator hearing, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C), defendant was found to be a sexually oriented offender, not a sexual predator. In any event, defendant was obligated to register with the sheriff pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04 following his release from prison. Defendant misplaced reliance on a certain decision that was subsequently reversed. In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court held that registration requirements imposed on a defendant adjudicated as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Columbiana Common Pleas Court (Ohio), classifying him as a sexual predator on the ground that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01, which created the classification of &quot;sexual predator,&quot; was enacted after defendant was convicted and sentenced for rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A) (2).

Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in finding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01, which created the classification of &quot;sexual predator,&quot; applied to defendant because defendant was convicted and sentenced for the rape prior to the date of the enactment of that statute. Moreover, defendant contended that the trial court erred in finding that &sect; 2950 did not violate double jeopardy protections or U.S. Const. amend. XIV and that it was not vague. The appeals court affirmed the determination that defendant was a sexual predator because the application of the classification contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950 to acts committed prior to the effective date of the statute did not violate the Retroactivity Clause of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 or the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the trial court, Hamilton County (Ohio), which convicted defendant of aggravated vehicular homicide while driving under a license suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide while driving under suspension. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The trial court substantially complied with Ohio R. Crim. P. 11(C) and statutorily imposed duties even though it did not personally inform defendant about the possibility of administrative sentence extension. Under the totality of the circumstances, defendant objectively understood the implications of the guilty plea and the rights he was waiving. The trial court explained defendant's rights to him and defendant executed a waiver expressly detailing the possibility of administrative sentence extension. The trial court did not err in sentencing defendant to the maximum term permitted by statute. The trial court had considered the presentence-investigation report, victim-impact statements, and medical reports, as well as the likelihood of defendant's recidivism because of his alcohol and drug problems. Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.06(C), defendant was not eligible for judicial release and thus imposition of the maximum sentence, which precluded judicial release, did not violate defendant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated vehicular homicide while driving under suspension. Defendant clearly understood the nature of the charges against him and the maximum penalty he faced when he pled guilty. The trial court properly sentenced defendant to the maximum term in light of the various reports, the likelihood of recidivism, and the seriousness of the offense.</SPAN></P>

Trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment to appellant's request for records of these investigations. Appellate court held that appellee board's investigatory records were privileged from discovery.

Defendant was convicted of four counts of raping his nine year old daughter. Defendant argued the lower court adjudicated him a sexual predator against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court noted the relevant factors for a court to consider when determining sexual predator status were contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; (C)(2). The court explained it was appropriate for the judge who presided at trial to consider evidence admitted at trial if it was specifically stated on the record what evidence was considered and a trial record existed to verify the information used. The court reversed and remanded based on the conclusion not enough factual information from the sexual predator hearing was present to indicate that the judge considered each relevant statutory factor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction by the Perry County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) which adjudicated him a sexual predator, and denied his motion to dismiss appellee-state's recommendation. Appellant contended that application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 was inapplicable as an ex post facto law, was contrary to the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions, and the evidence was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to one count of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition. Appellant's victims were three children age thirteen and under. When the state legislature created a sexual predator status offense, appellee state sought to declare appellant to be a sexual predator. Prior to the hearing, counsel for appellant filed a motion for an order finding the sexual predator statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, inapplicable as an ex post facto law and as being contrary to the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. Appellant also moved to dismiss appellee state's recommendation. After considering the testimony, the trial court found appellant to be a sexual predator, and appellant sought review. The court summarily denied appellant's constitutional challenges and affirmed the lower court's judgment. After analyzing the facts in light of the factors enumerated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2), the court found that the fact that appellant preyed on multiple victims of young age, was sufficient, competent, and credible enough evidence, for the trial court to base its holding that he was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's conviction of appellant as a sexual predator, and denial of his motion to dismiss. The court held proof that appellant preyed on multiple victims combined with the age of the victims, was sufficient, competent, credible evidence upon which a trial court could base its decision. Therefore the trial court's classification of appellant as a sexual predator was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) adjudicating him to be a habitual sexual offender, claiming the trial court failed to comply with Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to several counts of intimidation and sexual battery. The trial court thereafter conducted a sexual predator hearing, denying appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas and adjudicating him a habitual offender under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(E). Appellant raised several issues on appeal, including an argument that the trial court erred in deeming him a habitual sexual offender. In reversing solely on this issue, the appellate court concluded that the trial court based its habitual sexual offender determination upon appellant's guilty pleas to multiple charges of sexual battery in the same case, not because he had previously been convicted of or pled guilty to a sexual offense. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(E) permitted such an adjudication where there existed a prior conviction of one or more sexually oriented offenses. Because the trial court did not base its determination on the criteria outlined in section 2950.09(E) and because there was no evidence of such a prior conviction, the trial court erred in adjudicating appellant to be a habitual sexual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the judgment of conviction was affirmed, the trial court's adjudication deeming appellant to be an habitual offender was reversed, as the trial court failed to comply with the statute in basing its determination upon appellant's guilty pleas to multiple charges of sexual battery in the same case without a finding that appellant had been convicted of a prior sexual offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which held that appellant would be classified as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant committed a series of rapes in the 1970s, and was sent to prison. In June 1998, a trial judge classified appellant as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(A), over appellant's objection. Appellant challenged the ruling, claiming that the law violated due process, that it did not apply to his crimes, and that the trial judge did not have an adequate foundation to find that appellant should have been classified as a sexual predator. The court on appeal, held that appellant's constitutional and due process arguments were foreclosed by court precedent. However, the court determined that the state law only applied to sexual crimes committed after January 1, 1997, and not to earlier violations. The court stated that because appellant had not committed any sexual crimes after this date, he could not be classified as a sexual predator. Finally, the court concluded that the trial judge did not have an adequate basis upon which to determine if appellant could be classified as a sexual predator. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the state could not classify appellant as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the lower court and held that appellant's constitutional arguments against the sexual predator classification law was foreclosed, but that appellant could not be classified as a sexual predator, because the crime arose prior to the enactment of the law, and because the trial court was without adequate foundation to find that appellant could be classified under the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed decision of the Court of Common Pleas, Lorain County (Ohio), adjudicating him a sexual predator on the ground that he was constitutionally entitled to have a jury determine whether he was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on three counts of rape in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1)(b). The three attacks occurred on separate occasions, and the victim was 10 years old at the time of the first offense. Defendant pled guilty to three counts of attempted rape, and the plea was accepted. The trial court held a sexual predator hearing just prior to sentencing, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. Defendant objected to the sexual predator hearing on the basis that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court overruled this objection and found defendant to be a sexual predator. Defendant appealed on the ground that he was denied his right to trial by jury when the court adjudicated him as a sexual predator. The appeals court affirmed the trial court's finding because the reporting requirements which flowed from such an adjudication were not punishment, but, instead, were collateral consequences of the original offense. Moreover, the sexual predator hearing focused on the defendant's status, rather than the imposition of punishment; thus, the defendant's right to a trial by jury did not attach.</SPAN></P>

He sought review of the sexual predator adjudication and argued that the sexual predator label was unconstitutional, that the statute was void for vagueness, and that the decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court overruled the first two assignments of error because prior case law had already established the constitutionality of the sexual predator statute. The court reversed and remanded appellant's sexual predator adjudication because there was not enough factual information in the transcript from the sexual predator hearing to indicate that the trial court considered each factor in &sect; 2950.09(B)(2). The court also took issue with the reliance of the trial court upon the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections screening instrument for determination that appellant was a sexual predator when that instrument did not indicate from where the information was obtained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which found appellant to be a sexual predator for purposes of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. Appellant challenged ex post facto application and retroactive application of the statute and the denial of his request for a continuance, alleged double jeopardy violations, and claimed the evidence was insufficient to support the finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment finding appellant to be a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. Appellant was convicted of rape and corruption of a minor, and was incarcerated. Prior to a parole review date, the warden requested that the trial court classify appellant as a sexual predator. On review, the court rejected appellant's claim that the statute violated the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution, or the retroactivity clause of the state constitution. The court found that, because the provisions of the statute were not punitive in nature, they did not violate the principles of double jeopardy, and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided meaningful and detailed guidance, and set forth the standard of proof to be clear and convincing evidence. The court held that it was not an abuse of discretion to overrule appellant's motion to continue the hearing, as no specific timeframe was prescribed for the trial court to schedule the hearing, and the evidence was clear and convincing that appellant continued a course of conduct that demonstrated a pattern of abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's classification as a sexual offender was affirmed, because the evidence was sufficient to make a clear and convincing demonstration that appellant conducted a pattern of abuse. The court held that the sexual offender statute did not violate the ex post facto and retroactivity clauses of the federal and state constitutions, was not unconstitutionally vague, was not punitive in nature, and therefore did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The victim was a minor and had been repeatedly sexually abused. The trial court conducted a hearing, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(c), and classified defendant as a sexual predator. Defendant appealed, asserting various assignments of error. Affirming the trial court classification, the appellate court held that the trial court had not erred. The court explained that previously it had held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(c) had not violated the prohibition against Ex Post Facto laws. The court also found that &sect; 2950.09(c) had not violated the Double Jeopardy clauses of either the U.S. Const. art, I, &sect; 10 or the Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court had also previously held that &sect; 2950.09(c) was not vague and provided sufficient standards to the court for determining whether a person should be classified as a sexual predator. Finally, the court noted that the trial court did not have to demonstrate every factor in the statute before adjudicating someone a sexual predator.

Appellants were convicted of failing to register as a credit services corporation, charging an advance fee for credit services, and engaging in fraudulent acts in the sale of credit services. One defendant was also convicted for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the denial of their petitions for post-conviction relief. The reviewing court found that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction and did not err in stating that jurisdictional claims were precluded by res judicata. Because appellants could have raised the issue of selective enforcement during the trial process and on direct appeal, the trial court correctly applied res judicata to that claim. However, the court believed that appellants were entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether trial counsel was ineffective for failure to investigate appellants' claims and interview witnesses. Although appellants' claims had merit, the court could not grant relief because the post-conviction petitions were untimely, and the trial court should have simply dismissed the petitions. Appellants did not establish grounds for their untimely filing, and the requirements for an untimely petition were not met. No new federal or state right applied retroactively to their situation, and appellants could not argue that they were unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which the post-conviction petition was based.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Denial of petitions for post-conviction relief was affirmed because appellants offered no reasons to justify their delay in filing for relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death. Defendant filed a petition for postconviction relief under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21. Defendant also filed a motion for discovery and request for appointment of experts. The trial court denied appellant's petition without a hearing. Defendant claimed that the trial court failed to follow Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B) when it dismissed his petition for postconviction relief. The trial court also denied funds to appellant for a vehicular accident reconstruction expert because defendant testified that he caused the victim's death by pinning her down and putting his hand over her mouth. The trial court determined that defendant failed to prove prejudice by the denial of funds to employ said expert. The trial court dismissed both causes of action without a hearing because they could have been raised on direct appeal and were res judicata. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and held that defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was barred by res judicata. The court also held that defendant failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel was ineffective or that he was prejudiced thereby.</SPAN></P>

Since the section 1983 action was against appellee police officers in their official and not individual capacities, appellee municipality was the only real party in interest. Summary dismissal of appellants' section 1983 action was proper as appellants failed to identify any municipal official responsible for their arrests. Appellants' arrest was not a result of improper training. Summary dismissal of appellants' state-law tort claims was improper. There were genuine material factual questions regarding appellants' malicious prosecution claims as to lack of probable cause and malice.

The court noted that the Ohio Supreme Court had recently found the sexual predator statute to be constitutional. Accordingly, the court held that relator's claim that the law could not be applied to him because it was unconstitutional was rendered moot. Thus, the court found that relator had failed to demonstrate a clear legal right to the relief requested and the trial court had no clear legal duty to perform the requested relief.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State of Ohio sought review of a decision of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that found appellee to be a sexual predator but further found the notification provisions contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was found to be a sexual predator, but the notification provisions contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 were ruled unconstitutional by the trial court. Appellant State of Ohio sought review of the determination that ch. 2950 was unconstitutional; appellee sought review of the judgment entry. The court determined that ch. 2950 was not punitive, and that the protections against cruel and unusual punishment were not implicated. The statute did not violate double jeopardy nor was it unconstitutionally vague. Because ch. 2950 was determined to be remedial in nature, the constitutional protections afforded a criminal defendant were not implicated. The Ohio Constitution preserved the right to a jury trial in civil actions where the right existed prior to the adoption of the Constitution. The sexual predator classification and notification provisions were special statutory proceedings not present in common law, therefore no right to a trial by jury existed in a sexual predator classification hearing. The Ohio Sexual Predator Act did not involve a suspect class or a fundamental right, and the equal protection argument failed under the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court that the notification provisions contained in the Ohio Sexual Predator Act were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced for the crimes of rape, assault, and aggravated robbery. Following the effective date of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950, the Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections recommended that defendant be brought before the trial court for a determination of whether defendant was a sexual predator. The trial court determined by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was a sexual predator. Defendant appealed, arguing that his guilty plea was not made knowingly and intelligently because he was unaware of the additional consequence that he potentially could be adjudicated a sexual predator, and that &sect; 2950 was unconstitutional. The court ruled the requirements of &sect; 2950 were merely collateral, and because the consequences were collateral, the trial court was under no obligation to inform defendant of them. Further, the court held that guilty pleas entered into before the sexual predator provisions went into effect did not violate a defendant's due process rights or Ohio R. Crim. P. 11. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that because the provisions at issue were remedial and not punitive, there were no constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding defendant to be a sexual predator was affirmed and did not violate defendant's due process rights even though his guilty plea was entered before the sexual predator laws went into effect and he could not have known of the possibility of such future consequences. The statutory provisions at issue were not punitive, but rather, served the remedial purpose of protecting the public.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a trial court judgment, after a jury trial, convicting him of the aggravated murder of a police officer and four counts of aggravated robbery. The trial court sentenced appellant to death on the aggravated murder convictions and imprisonment for the aggravated robbery convictions. The appellate court affirmed. No procedural or evidentiary errors occurred during appellant's trial. Evidence obtained during the warrantless search of appellant's home was admissible because the evidence was recovered during a permissible sweep of appellant's home for the officers' safety and was incidental to arrest. Identification evidence was properly admitted because the identification procedures used were not unnecessarily suggestive or conducive to irreparable mistaken identification. The jury selection process was constitutional because the jury array was selected from a cross-section of the community and voir dire of prospective jurors was proper. Jury instructions given both during the trial phrase and the sentencing phrase were proper. The aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors and the death sentence was appropriate based on the severity of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment was granted to defendant insurer in plaintiffs' action to recover under insurance policies for injuries sustained in an automobile accident, and plaintiffs appealed. The reviewing court determined that the trial court erred in not considering the language in the policies, and by simply concluding that the policies were &quot;new&quot; because they had been renewed. The anti-stacking provisions were ambiguous because they depended on law that was unknown at the time of contracting. Because automobile liability coverage was extended to plaintiffs, the homeowners' policy was a &quot;motor vehicle liability policy&quot; under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18. Based on the undisputed facts, the trial court should have found uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverage in an amount equal to the liability limits of plaintiffs' homeowners policy. Genuine issues of material fact existed on plaintiffs' negligence claims in connection with the agent's alleged failure to offer or to recommend an umbrella policy and with respect to the coverage limits that the agent said he recommended. There was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant violated the bad-faith standard.</SPAN></P>

Code ch. 2950. Appellant asserted that the evidence presented at his hearing was insufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was a sexual predator. Court held that in making a determination as to whether an offender was a sexual predator, the trial judge must consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to the factors listed in the statute. Court found that based on the facts of the underlying case and appellant's prior history, clear and convincing evidence was presented at the hearing to justify the disposition that appellant was likely to engage in similar behavior in the future. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred in imposing the registration requirements upon him because he was sentenced before the effective date of the statute. Court held that sexual oriented offenders released from prison on or after the effective date of the statute were required to register and that the section clearly applied to sexual oriented offenders sentenced before the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged his conviction, arguing that the trial court improperly prohibited his defense by initially prohibiting his attack of the victim's credibility under the Ohio rape shield laws, stating that trial counsel gave ineffective assistance of counsel and that the trial court failed to conduct a hearing before classifying him as a sexual predator. The court held that the trial judge cured any abuse of discretion by allowing appellant to attack the victim's credibility, despite the Ohio rape shields law, because it was used to show that the victim's behavioral problems resulted from a previous rape, and not due to appellant's conduct. The court also determined that defense counsel did not give ineffective assistance of counsel, holding that all perceived errors were trial strategies. Finally, the court concluded that the trial judge erred in failing to conduct a hearing before classifying appellant as a sexual predator, and remanded for a hearing to be conducted in accordance with Ohio Rev.

In exchange for a plea of guilty on the count of attempted felonious sexual penetration, a nolle prosequi was entered on the other counts. The trial court accepted appellant's guilty plea and filed a handwritten note on the sentencing sheet, &quot;Shock after one year by agreement.&quot; The trial court found appellant to be a sexual predator and sentenced him. A year later appellant moved to suspend further execution of his sentence, and the court denied the motion for shock probation. Appellant sought review, arguing that the plea agreement was breached when the trial court refused to grant him shock probation after one year. The court affirmed. &quot;Shock after one year by agreement&quot; did not accurately reflect the parties' agreement set forth in the transcript of the plea hearing. The only agreement made with respect to shock probation was that appellant would not file for shock probation until he had served one year of his sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment entry that adjudicated him a sexual predator, as defined in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E). On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment against appellant. In rejecting appellant's contentions that his sexual predator hearing violated ex post facto, retroactivity, and double jeopardy guarantees, the court ruled that appellant's claims were meritless based primarily on State v Cook, 83 Ohio St. 3d 404, 700 N.E.2d 570 (1998). Specifically, the court ruled that because the classification and registration statutes were remedial in nature and served to protect the public, the statutes did not offend ex post facto or retroactivity principles. In rejecting appellant's claim that the trial court's adjudicating him a sexual predator was not supported by clear and convincing evidence, the court ruled that the judgment was supported by some competent, credible evidence. The court ruled that the trial court's findings, based upon the elements contained in section 2950.09(B)(2), that appellant had a prior criminal record and that his sexual abuse of his minor victim spanned several years, supported its conclusion that appellant was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping, and obstruction of justice. The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment for the offenses and for prior pleas of guilty to endangering children, gross abuse of a corpse, and tampering with evidence. Defendant appealed. The appellate court held the lack of direct evidence did not lead to a conclusion that the prosecution failed to prove the requisite intent. The jury could presume the requisite intent where the natural and probable consequences of defendant's action was to produce death and the jury could conclude, from all surrounding circumstances, that defendant had an intention to kill. Defendant's motion under Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 was properly overruled because there was sufficient direct and circumstantial evidence to support a jury finding that defendant intentionally killed the victim. The court found, however, that the imposition of consecutive sentences was error. The trial court's asserted consideration of the statutory factors was inadequate. The record did not contain some indication, by use of specific operative facts, that the court considered the statutory factors in making its determinations.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review of involuntary manslaughter and kidnapping counts. Appellant's husband had &quot;tossed&quot; his stepdaughter, and upon discovering she had died, the couple buried her in a garbage can in their backyard. When relatives became suspicious of the girl's whereabouts, the family fled, taking their three minor children with them. Trial court judgment was affirmed. Trial court did not err in admitting coroner's opinion testimony regarding cause of death, as his testimony did not fall under Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 (B)(1)(d), nor was the admission of hypothetical testimony of coroner error. Coroner's &quot;better chance opinion&quot; was properly admitted, as it showed that the lack of medical attention in combination with the onset of diffuse axonal injury caused the girl's death. Appellant's charges of kidnapping under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.01 (A)(5) was held to reach conduct by custodial parents, and was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's arguments that the statute gave no guidance to courts in determining whether or not a sexual offender was likely to commit a future offense because the court was to apply a clear and convincing standard of proof to its determination. The court additionally disagreed with defendant's assertions that the factors to be employed by the state to determine whether a sexual offender was a sexual predator were vague. The court found no merit to defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to allocate the burden of proof to either the state or to the sexual offender.

Here, the general assembly clearly expressed its intent that the time limits imposed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21(A) be applied retrospectively. The court explained, however, that a purely remedial statute does not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. Remedial laws affected only the remedy provided and included laws that merely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy for the enforcement of an existing right. Laws that related to procedure were ordinarily remedial in nature. The time-limit provision in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner was convicted and sentenced for gross sexual imposition and corruption of a minor. He challenged a later determination that he was a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(C). The court found that even if defendant did not meet statutory predicates to a habitual sex offender determination to support his status as a sexual predator, he had stipulated to being a habitual sexual offender and waived his right to challenge his status. The court also noted that defendant had entered a plea agreement whereby he could take a 20-year registration period pursuant to statutes that did not necessarily apply to his circumstances to avoid a possible lifetime registration requirement. The court would not allow him to benefit from his own invited error. Because sex offender laws were remedial in nature, they did not impose an additional punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, or violate the retroactivity or ex post facto provisions of Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, or U. S. Const. art I, &sect; 10.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Stark County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) classifying him as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of one count of rape and one count of kidnapping, and sentenced to prison. Appellant sought review of a judgment from the trial court classifying him as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, and on appeal the court affirmed. The statute did not violate the ex post facto or retroactivity clauses of the United States or Ohio constitutions. It did not violate constitutional prohibitions on double jeopardy nor was it unconstitutionally vague. The trial court did not err in denying appellant's request for a continuance of the sexual predator hearing. Finally, the judgment finding appellant to be a sexual predator was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Sexual predator was defined as a person who was convicted of or pleaded guilty to sexually oriented offense and was likely to engage in the future in one of more sexually oriented offenses. In addition to appellant's current conviction, he was previously convicted of rape, kidnapping and assault with intent to rape, and rape with force. There was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that appellant was a sexual predator as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which classified appellant as a sexual predator pursuant to the statute, because there was sufficient evidence to support that conclusion. In addition to appellant's current conviction for rape and kidnapping, he was previously convicted of rape, kidnapping and assault with intent to rape, and rape with force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee was working the assembly line and her machine jammed, so she turned her machine off and reached into it when another employee restarted it, which severely injured her hand. Plaintiff and her husband sued defendant employer based upon intentional tort. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment that was granted by the lower court. Plaintiff sought review and the court affirmed. The court held that to prove that an employer committed an intentional tort, the employee must show that the employer had knowledge of the existence of a dangerous process, procedure, instrumentality, or condition within its business operation; that the employer knew that if the employee was subject by his employment to such dangerous procedure or condition, then harm to the employee would be a substantial certainty; and the employer required the employee to continue to perform the dangerous task. Because plaintiff failed to introduce any evidence of substantial certainty, summary judgment was proper. The court ruled that mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk -- something short of substantial certainty -- did not constitute the necessary intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court adjudicated defendant to be a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01 et seq. On this appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the sexual predator law and the adequacy of the trial court's hearing held prior to making the sexual predator determination. Defendant contended the trial court erred in determining him to be a sexual predator because the state did not present clear and convincing evidence he was likely to participate in sexually oriented offenses in the future. The court held that after completing a review of the facts presented in the record and noting defendant's age and that of the victim, the nature of the sexual conduct and sexual contact he had with the victim, the fact that he used his superior position, size, and age to dominate a medically infirm individual, and that he caused her submission at knife point, the court concluded the trial court's classification as a sexual predator was established by clear and convincing evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, automobile driver and occupant, were injured during a car collision with appellee driver and sued more than two years after the accident. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted after appellants failed to object to this motion. Appellants filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied.

The court held that the lower court did not err in denying reconsideration because final orders were not subject to reconsideration; therefore, a motion for reconsideration filed after a final appealable order was entered was a nullity.

Defendant appealed alleging various constitutional defects in the sexual predator statute and alleging the trial court erred in determining him to be a sexual predator. The court affirmed the trial court's determination. It rejected defendant's constitutional claims on the basis that such claims had been previously addressed by the Ohio Supreme Court and appellate decisions and found to be without merit. The court found that the state had presented clear and convincing evidence that defendant was likely to participate in sexually-oriented offenses in the future.

Defendants were convicted and, on appeal, each of the convictions was reversed. Two defendants were acquitted of making false statements and one defendant was acquitted of a portion of the theft charges because of insufficient evidence. The other charges were remanded for a new trial. The unregistered securities convictions violated due process because they were based on an improper retroactive application of a judicial enlargement of Ohio securities laws. The trial court committed plain error with respect to jury instructions regarding aiding and abetting and the definition of &quot;knowingly&quot; in the context of the theft offenses.

Defendant was also adjudicated a sexual predator under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01. Defendant sought review, alleging that the sexual predator statute was unconstitutional and that he should have received credit for time served. The court rejected defendant's first argument because the statute did not offend equal protection analysis even though it treated defendants in custody for a sexually oriented offense on or after January 1, 1997, differently from those who were no longer in custody after that date. The differential treatment satisfied the rational basis test. The court agreed with the second argument, and reversing and remanding for resentencing. The court ruled that while it was unable to reduce the sentence under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.13(F), the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction was required to reduce the stated prison term to reflect pre-sentence incarceration, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) denying his request for postconviction relief, after he had been sentenced to death for each of the three murders he had committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing three murders and was sentenced to death for each. Defendant's motion for postconviction relief was denied, and he appealed. Defendant claimed that the trial court had erred in disposing of his postconviction petition without adhering to the requirements of Ohio Civ. R. 56. The court held that the trial court only needed to follow the procedures set forth in the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21 which allowed for the dismissal of the postconviction motion without a hearing. The court then considered defendant's claims for relief and ruled that defendant's self-serving affidavit was insufficient to overcome the application of res judicata on claims which were raised or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal. It also found that defendant had failed to proffer evidence to demonstrate a lack of effective assistance of counsel or that he was prejudiced by trial counsel's performance. The court held that Ohio did not recognize a defense of diminished capacity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision denying defendant postconviction relief as he had failed to show any facts to establish ineffective assistance of counsel and res judicata applied to claims he should have brought at trial or on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the Scioto County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted appellant of first-degree felony rape in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and found appellant to be a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of felony rape in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1)(b), after appellant pled guilty to forcing his girlfriend's seven-year-old to perform fellatio. Before sentencing the lower court conducted a sexual predator hearing. Affirming the judgment of the lower court finding appellant to be a sexual predator, the court found that the lower court's error in failing to give appellant written notice of the hearing as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(1) did not amount to plain error because appellant had constructive notice of the hearing and had not been prejudiced by the error. Because appellant appeared and failed to object at the time of the hearing, was prepared, and had knowledge under &sect; 2950.09(B) that a hearing would be held prior to or in conjunction with his sentencing, the court found that the lower court's error had not prejudiced appellant. Where the court reviewed the factors of &sect; 2950.09(B)(2), and where there was evidence regarding appellant's likeliness to commit future sex offenses, the court found that the lower court's classification of appellant as a sexual predator was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of lower court classifying appellant as a sexual predator affirmed where the lower court's failure to provide written notice of the hearing did not prejudice appellant because he had constructive knowledge of the hearing and appeared without objection and where the court finding that appellant was likely to commit future sex offenses was not against the weight of the evidence where the court had reviewed the relevant factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which classified him as a sexual predator in accordance with Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(B), challenging the constitutionality of the sexual predator law, the adequacy of the trial court's hearing held prior to making the sexual predator determination, and the court's refusal to appoint an expert.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nearly seven years after appellant pleaded guilty to two sexual battery counts with specifications, appellant was subjected to a hearing under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950(B)(1), which resulted in a determination that he was a sexual predator. Holding that the determination was not an unconstitutional ex post facto punishment, and that there was sufficient evidence to classify appellant under the law, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that &sect; 2950(B)(1) violated neither U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, nor Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The court held that clear and convincing evidence supported the finding, including the evidence of the victims' young ages, the disparity in ages between the victims and appellant, and the variety of sexually deviant acts committed by appellant. The court held that the Ohio Rules of Evidence were not strictly applicable to a &sect; 2950(B)(1) hearing, and that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's request for a court-appointed psychological expert, because appellant had cited no grounds for the appointment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment classifying appellant as a sexual predator. Although the sexual predator law was passed after the commission of appellant's crimes, it was not a criminal proceeding, nor designed to punish appellant, and was, therefore, not an unconstitutional ex post facto determination. Clear and convincing evidence existed to classify appellant as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, and having a weapon while under disability. Defendant appealed, assigning 19 errors. The court upheld defendant's conviction based upon all errors that defendant asserted the trial court made during trial. Defendant's motions for a new and for a separate trial were properly denied where there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court and no prejudice to defendant. Evidence of defendant's prior conviction was properly admitted where such was an essential element of the weapons charge. Evidence obtained under a search warrant and statements made by defendant were properly admitted where the descriptions in the warrant were sufficiently specific and where defendant had been properly stopped by the police at the time that the statements in question were made. The court however, reversed defendant's sentence where the trial court, having originally merged defendant's sentences for the murder and robbery counts, improperly increased defendant's sentence after defendant had already started to serve the original sentence, by resentencing defendant separately on those counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions affirmed where no errors were found in the trial court's rulings and procedure during trial or in the jury's verdict. Defendant's sentence reversed and remanded where defendant's resentence constituted an impermissible increase of defendant's original sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant was properly sentenced for both the rape and the kidnapping convictions because, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25, the two offenses were committed separately and asportation by deception was significantly independent of the force the appellant used to compel the victim to submit to him. The court held appellant's conviction of gross sexual imposition and kidnapping was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence because the victim testified as to the acts committed by appellant and the state's evidence was uncontradicted. The court held the state was not required to corroborate victim's testimony to obtain a conviction. The court also held that appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

Pursuant to &sect; 2723.03, appellants bore the burden of producing evidence to show that they filed written protests as to the assessments sought to be recovered at the time the assessments were paid. New emergency legislation was enacted by appellees, in accordance with the city charter, regarding the way lighting assessments were being collected.

Appellant pled no contest to three counts of illegal voting in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3599.12 and the trial court entered judgment convicting appellant of those offenses. On appeal, the court stated that because &sect; 3599.12 prohibited voting by those who were not legally qualified to vote, and because both Ohio Const. art. V, &sect; 1 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3503.01 defined a qualified voter as a U.S. citizen, appellant had notice that it was illegal for him to vote. The court held that because aliens had no constitutional right to vote, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. In addition, the court held the statute was a strict liability statute because there was a substantial public interest in prohibiting non-citizens from voting. Therefor, the court affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant of illegal voting because the statute prohibiting appellant from voting was a strict liability statute and because the statute was not unconstitutionally vague in light of the fact that appellant had notice from the express provisions of the federal and state constitutions and state statutes that only citizens were legally qualified to vote and had a right to vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, victim and administrator of decedent son's estate, sued appellee city for bad faith, recklessness, and gross negligence in failing to control a crowd prior to the eruption of violence during which appellant victim was seriously injured, and appellant administrator's son was killed. Appellee claimed immunity under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2744, and moved for summary judgment. Appellants argued that the negligent operation of a motor vehicle exception to the grant of immunity under &sect; 2744 applied to appellee's police officers' inaction in failing to control the crowd before violence broke out. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellee, and appellants sought review. The court affirmed, explaining that the exception appellants relied upon applied to cases where a political subdivision's employee caused a propelled vehicle to function without due care on a public highway and did not apply to the instant case where police officers allegedly did not make their presence known in their marked vehicles, and did not attempt to clear the crowd before violence erupted. Further, precedent established that the immunities under &sect; 2744 did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant formed a company engaged in the business of acting as a middleman between the manufacturers of construction supplies and certain construction companies. Appellant was the sole owner and primary salesman. Middleman purchased guardrail materials from manufacturer. Manufacturer's bank returned middleman's check for insufficient funds. After manufacturer attempted to collect on the check, the matter was turned over to the court. Appellant's conviction for passing a bad check in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.11(A) was affirmed. Given the permissive language in the third paragraph of the jury instruction, a reasonable jury could have only concluded that it was not necessarily required to apply the presumption simply because the state had proven the underlying facts. The instruction did not place a burden upon appellant to rebut the evidential presumption beyond a reasonable doubt. Avoidance of paying a debt in a timely manner constituted a benefit for purposes of the definition of &quot;defraud.&quot; The evidence before the jury supported the finding that it was simply unbelievable that appellant had no knowledge that the check had been returned for insufficient funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction because the jury instruction was legally sufficient, the state presented some evidence upon which a reasonable person could conclude that appellant had knowingly used deception to gain a benefit for himself or cause a detriment to manufacturer, and the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellees' answer claimed statutory immunity. The department's motion for summary judgment was granted. On appeal, appellant contended that appellees were not entitled to immunity under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2744.02 or 2744.03 because they failed to follow the mandatory provisions of &sect; 2151.421 which required them to investigate abuse allegations within 24 hours. The court held that &sect; 2151.421 did not expressly impose liability upon the employee for failure to comply with its provisions; therefore, unless the individual appellees acted wantonly or recklessly while conducting the investigation, they were entitled to immunity as well. The court held that as a matter of law the individual defendants did not act in an unreasonable or perverse manner.

Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B) (1). The court affirmed the determination, finding that the age of the victim, the degree of violence involved, and the physical and emotional trauma suffered by the victim justified the finding. The court concluded that appellant was not improperly denied his request for a psychological evaluation as the court was not required to accept the evaluation and appellant did not argue its necessity before the trial court. The court concluded that based upon the foregoing, it had nothing in the record affording it the opportunity to assess whether appellant had more than a mere possibility of assistance from an expert. However, the court found that it was improper for the record to reflect appellant's automatic classification as a sexual predator, and remanded the matter to correct the record. The court determined that an automatic classification as a sexual predator could only occur for specified conduct after the enactment of the statute, and appellant's conduct was prior to that enactment, so his designation had to come as the result of a determination hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, and disseminating material harmful to juveniles. He was charged with raping his two nieces and giving them a sexually transmitted disease. The prosecutor outlined that three types of sexual offenders existed under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950: (1) a sexually oriented offender, one who was convicted of a sexual offense; (2) a habitual offender, one who was convicted of two separate sexual offenses; and (3) a sexual predator, one who was likely to reoffend. The defense argued that defendant only qualified as a sexual oriented offender. After finding him a sexual predator, the court designated him a habitual offender. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence did not meet the standard of proof required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B); the court erred by declining his request for a psychological evaluation; and the court erroneously imposed registration requirements. The court overruled defendant's assignments of error. The trial court's finding that defendant was a habitual sexual offender was error, so the case was remanded to correct that finding only.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sued in a city municipal court's small claims division to collect on a check it had cashed that was issued by appellant, who had previously directed a stop payment on the check. Appellant filed a counterclaim for actual and punitive damages, which removed the suit from the small claims division. Appellee then retained an attorney to handle the case. The trial court judge ruled for appellee in its suit and against appellant's counterclaim, and later awarded an amount for reasonable attorney fees as sanctions against appellant and its attorney for violating Ohio R. Civ. P. 11 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2323.51, finding that they engaged in frivolous conduct by filing their counterclaim without evidentiary support. On appeal, the court held that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in imposing sanctions as appellant's conduct was clearly within the meaning of frivolous conduct as defined by &sect; 2323.51(A)(2)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii). However, the calculation of the monetary sanction was wrong as a non-lawyer improperly drafted appellee's complaint, and the trial judge based her decision upon appellee's need to retain counsel.

The court affirmed because appellant was not denied a fair trial, jurors were qualified, appellant knowingly and intelligently waived his rights, appellant was not prejudiced by the grand jury selection process, and Ohio's death penalty was not unconstitutional.

The trial court denied the motion, and defendant pled no contest. Defendant appealed both convictions. The appeals court affirmed because the ordinance was not unconstitutional because it did not grant the health commissioner unbridled discretion to deny defendant a license because the ordinance contained numerous factors which had to be met before a license could be granted. Moreover, defendant was denied the license because of safety and welfare concerns, and the denial of a license for such reasons, which were provided for in the ordinance, was not equivalent to a denial based upon unbridled discretion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrator of father's estate sought to collect under automobile liability policy on behalf of minor children for loss of parental consortium. Appellee insurer had already paid the maximum per person limit for father's wrongful death. The trial court ruled in favor of insurer. Appellant claimed children were entitled to their own cause of action under Schaefer v. Allstate Ins. Co. (1996), 76 Ohio St. 3d 553, 668 N.E.2d 913. On appeal, the court held that the enactment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44 expressly declared policy provisions that treated all claims arising out of one person's bodily injury as a single claim to be enforceable, that it was enacted to supersede the effect of Schaefer. The court found that the policy, which renewed after the effective date of the statute, was subject to this provision, even though its renewal was guaranteed prior to the effective date. Implementation of the statute was constitutional as it did not deny the children's right to redress; it only allowed insurer to limit its contractual liability.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant did not have a constitutionally protected right to knowingly cause his former wife to believe he would cause her physical harm or mental distress by engaging in those acts closely related in time in contravention of several no contact orders. Defendant failed to present any evidence that made &sect; 2903.211 void and unenforceable.

Appellant was arrested two more times, and after a hearing, the trial court dismissed appellant's habeas corpus action, and denied his motion for a preliminary injunction.

Appellant sought review and asserted four assignments of error.

The court held the trial court was not obligated to consider all of the factors, which were merely guidelines for the court, but was rather required to base its decision on clear and convincing evidence.

It held that the sexual predator laws had been held not to violate the privacy, equal protection, double jeopardy, and cruel and unusual punishment clauses, of the state and federal constitutions. It further held that the trial court properly considered the statutory criteria, including age of the offender compared with the victims' ages, prior convictions, use of drugs and alcohol to impair victims, and a pattern of abuse.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners obtained permits from appellee township to build a house on a parcel of real property. After laying a foundation, construction ceased, and appellants left trailers and other vehicles on the property. Appellee eventually cancelled the building permit and sought an injunction requiring appellants to remove the vehicles. Appellants then began placing pigs on the property in an apparent attempt to exempt the property from appellee's control under an exception for property used for agricultural purposes. The lower court granted the injunction in favor of appellee, and appellants asserted twelve assignments of error on appeal. Regarding appellants' claim of exemption from appellee's zoning ordinances under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.21(A) because they were now using the land for agricultural purposes, the court stated there was a presumption that the trial court's findings were correct. In addition, the record indicated no plausible connection between the vehicles and appellant's meager agricultural endeavors. The court found no merit in this or any of appellants' other claims, overruled all assignments of error, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment adjudicating defendant a sexual predator after defendant was convicted of attempted rape and gross sexual imposition. The court held that the adjudication did not violate his right to due process because the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B) were not punishment. The court reasoned that defendant had an opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf during a hearing at which he was present with counsel. The court ruled that defendant had no constitutional right for a jury to determine his designation as a sexual predator. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 addressed collateral consequences and not punishment, and that Ohio Crim. R. 11 did not require that defendant had to be informed about the registration and notification requirements accompanying his designation as a sexual predator. The court summarily rejected defendant's claim that his adjudication under Ohio Rev.

Defendant's attorney did not claim he was not given notice and did not object to the admission of hearsay or challenge the statute on constitutional grounds. Defendant was adjudicated a sexual predator and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and it met the requirements of &sect; 2950.09. The statute was neither an ex post facto law nor unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, the admission of hearsay was not improper because the rules of evidence did not apply to sexual predator hearings and there was no evidence that he was deprived of adequate notice of the hearing. Consequently, his attorney's performance was not ineffective, and defendant was not prejudiced by his performance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the determination of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court (Ohio) where he was labeled a sexual predator. Appellant asserted that it was not shown by clear and convincing evidence that he was &quot;likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses&quot; and argued that he should not be required to register because he was sentenced prior to the effective date of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of raping a small child and was subsequently labeled a sexual predator. Appellant had no prior sexual offenses and immediately reported his crime after it was committed. Appellant asserted that it was not shown by clear and convincing evidence that he was &quot;likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses&quot; per Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01 and argued that he should not be required to register because he was sentenced prior to the effective date of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04. On review, the court determined that the effective date of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04 would have required appellant to register due to the legislature's intent. The court also examined the risk factors and the psychological reports. The court held that, while the evidence showed that appellant committed sexually oriented offenses on one occasion, it did not necessarily establish by clear and convincing evidence that he was, more likely than not, predisposed to commit another sexually oriented offense. Therefore, the court sustained his assignment of error and vacated appellant's adjudication as a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled appellant's argument that he should not be required to register due to the effective date of Ohio's sexual predator law because the statute did apply to him. However, the court vacated appellant's adjudication as a sexual predator because the evidence did not necessarily establish by clear and convincing evidence that he was, more likely than not, predisposed to commit another sexually oriented offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a traffic stop, an officer discovered two male children along with several hundred pornographic magazines in appellant's van. Appellant was subsequently convicted of two counts each of rape, kidnapping, disseminating matter harmful to juveniles, and counts of gross sexual imposition. A decision finding appellant to be a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C) was affirmed in part on constitutional grounds but reversed and remanded in part on other grounds. Although the trial court was presented with evidence to support the first prong of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E)'s definition of sexual predator, it was provided with nothing beyond the facts of appellant's convictions to satisfy the second prong. Many of the factors set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) were not met. The trial judge never mentioned either the factors or the relevant subsection of the statute. The trial court refused to refer appellant for a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation. It was likely the use of expert testimony would have assisted the trial court in making a more accurate finding as to appellant's status.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2950.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on three counts of corruption of a minor and sentenced to a total aggregate sentence of six years incarceration in 1993. In 1997, the trial court, acting pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950, determined that defendant, who was still incarcerated, was a sexual predator. Defendant raised several assignments of error in a challenge to the trial court's determination that he was a sexual predator. The trial court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court rejected defendant's contention that portions of &sect; 2950 were unconstitutional retroactive and ex post facto legislation. The court noted that &sect; 2950 was not a criminal statute because it only served the remedial purpose of protecting the public. The court also found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, which does not apply to prior offenders who had completed their sentences as of July 1, 1997, did not violate equal protection, because it did not involve a suspect class or a fundamental right and the protection of the public from sex offenses is a legitimate governmental interest. Finally, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01's clear and convincing standard was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant-appellant challenged a judgment that convicted and sentenced him for rape, upon his guilty plea, asserting his sentence should have been modified to credit him for the time he spent incarcerated for the charged crime before trial. The state argued, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.13(F), that no pre-trial jail time could be credited against a sentence for the offense of rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant-appellant sought review of his conviction and sentence upon a plea of guilty for rape, asserting the trial court erred when it determined he was not eligible for jail time credit for the time he spent incarcerated before trial. The state relied upon Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.13(F) for the proposition that no pre-trial jail time could be credited against a sentence for the offense of rape. The court held there was no legitimate state interest to be served by allowing a state to grant full credit for all periods of confinement to the class of defendants who were capable of posting bond, while denying full credit to another class of defendants who, as a result of their indigence, were not capable of avoiding pre-trial incarceration by posting bond. The court further held that a statutory scheme in which pre-trial jail time was not credited against the sentence imposed offended the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Accordingly, because &sect; 2929.13(F) was unconstitutional, the judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for resentencing with appropriate credit for defendant-appellant's pre-trial incarceration on the charge upon which he pleaded guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for resentencing, because the statutory scheme in which pre-trial jail time was not credited against the sentence imposed offended the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and as a result, defendant-appellant was entitled to credit for his pre-trial incarceration on the charge upon which he pled guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Using a minor confidential informant, the police set up a controlled buy of alcohol at a bar. Criminal defendant sold a beer to the informant and was charged with selling alcohol to a minor in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4301.69. The jury returned a verdict of guilty and defendant appealed. The court found the trial court did not err in refusing to permit counsel to argue mens rea or by not instructing the jury accordingly because it had consistently held that &sect; 4301.69 was a strict liability offense. It then determined that hearsay evidence was not improperly admitted as to the informant's age because no out-of-court statement was offered into evidence regarding the informant's age. Additionally, the court determined that the trial court did not err in denying his motion for acquittal because plaintiff prosecution failed to offer evidence that the substance sold was alcohol. The record clearly indicated that defendant entered into a stipulation on the record that the substance was alcohol. Finding the remaining contentions to be meritless, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting defendant of selling alcohol to a minor was affirmed because argument or instructions regarding mens rea was properly denied in that the offense was a strict liability offense, hearsay evidence was not offered by plaintiff prosecution regarding the informant's age, evidence proving the substance was alcohol was unnecessary due to a stipulation to that fact, and the remaining contentions were meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(1), 2907.32(A)(2), 2907.32(A)(5), 2907.321(A)(1), 2907.322(A)(1), 2907.323(A)(1), 2907.321(A)(5), 2907.322(A)(5), 2907.323(A)(3), and concluded that defendant was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A former co-worker of defendant discovered that her name and phone number had been attached to three pornographic pictures that were posted on the Internet. The police discovered that the pictures had been uploaded from defendant's account and obtained a search warrant. The police confiscated defendant's computer and found a large number of pornographic pictures. Defendant was indicted on nine counts in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.32(A)(1), (A)(2), and (A)(5); 2907.321(A)(1) and (A)(5); 2907.322(A)(1) and (A)(5); and 2907.323(A)(1) and (A)(3). Defendant was convicted and found to be a sexual predator. Defendant appealed his conviction and sexual predator adjudication. The court found that defendant's sentencing of prison was not an abuse of discretion by the trial court because it acted within the statutory limits under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.12(A). Further, the court found that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.05(E) was not vague and did not violate his rights, that there was no plain error in relying on testimony from a police captain, and that there was sufficient evidence to permit a finding that defendant was likely to re-offend and was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the trial court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing defendant to prison because it acted within the statutory limits and did not exhibit an attitude that could be characterized as unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and because there was sufficient evidence to find that defendant was likely to re-offend and was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>

The reviewing court further held that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09 was not vague and that it provided sufficient standards to guide trial courts.

The court concluded that the public notification requirements of &sect; 2950.09 did not violate defendant's right to privacy.

The court agreed with defendant that he was wrongly convicted on the charge of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. The court reasoned that although the crimes of aggravated murder and conspiracy to commit aggravated murder did not constitute crimes of similar import within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.25(A), it was clear that the legislature intended that a person convicted of aggravated murder was not to be convicted of a conspiracy involving the same offense. Accordingly, defendant's conviction for conspiracy constituted plain error and was reversed. The court declined, however, to set aside his sentence of death because no evidence supported defendant's contention that his conviction for conspiracy prejudiced him during the penalty phase of the trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals reversed and remanded a judgment and order, which denied appellant expungement of certain records maintained by the Department of Children Services. The court concluded that the trial court erred when it did not allow the sealing of the records pursuant to the representations of the Shelby County Prosecutor that sealing the records was not opposed. The court found that the trial court's decision was premised upon the mistaken belief that the courts lacked any power to seal children services records. The court believed, however, that courts had discretion to seal such records under the judicial expungement doctrine. The court adopted reasoning that where there was no statutory authority to grant an expungement of a criminal record, the court might order a record sealed by exercise of its inherent powers. The court noted that judicial expungement was only available in unusual and exceptional circumstances, but must be granted if the state had no compelling reason to keep the records.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court adjudicated appellant a sexually oriented offender pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950. Appellant challenged his adjudication contending he was denied due process of law when the correctional facility allegedly failed to follow &sect; 2950.09(C)(1)'s procedure for requesting a hearing to adjudicate his status as a sexual predator. Although the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction was required to consider the factors set forth in &sect; 2950.09(B)(2) before requesting a hearing, appellant contended that none of the factors could have been considered as the correctional facility merely indicated that its recommendation was based upon a pre-sentence investigation report and no such report was ever conducted. The court found that a Sexual Predator Screening Instrument attached to the Department's recommendation to label appellant followed the statutory dictates by addressing all of the factors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prosecution appealed a judgment of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) which found Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(C)(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape and sentenced thereon in 1978. Ohio Rev. Code ch. 2950, effective January 1, 1997, created certain registration and notification requirements for an individual determined to be a sexually oriented offender. The statute provided for retroactive application. The trial court made a factual finding that defendant was a sexual predator. Despite this finding, in its decision filed that same day, the trial court found the community notification provision contained in Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(C)(2) violated Ohio Const. art II, &sect; 28. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the trial court erred in ruling that the notification provisions violated the constitutional prohibition against retroactive laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the notification provisions of the sexual predator law did not violate the constitutional prohibition against retroactive laws, reversing the trial court's decision. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that defendant was a sexual predator.</SPAN></P>
