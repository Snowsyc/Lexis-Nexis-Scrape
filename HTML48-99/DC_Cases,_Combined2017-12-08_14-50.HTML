</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the university argued that the recognition of a student activity meant endorsement and as such, the university had the right to withhold official recognition of a student activity that was not consistent with the university's educational mission of promoting Catholic teachings. However, the gay rights organizations argued that the university's recognition of a student organization implied only a neutral acknowledgment of a group's existence and not an endorsement of its goals and activities. The court determined that the university's endorsement of a student activity was an expression of tolerance and did not indicate an approval because the university had recognized other organizations that conflicted with Catholic teachings. Further, the court determined that the state interest of preventing discriminatory practices by educational institutions against student groups based on sexual orientation outweighed the university's concerns that recognition of the gay rights organizations would imply that the university administration was spreading or affirming gay rights views.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also appealed the inconsistent application of the plain error rule in the context of an instructional error raised in his initial appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's trial, he failed to object to jury instructions relating to charges of a lesser included offense. He appealed his convictions, contending that merger of the offenses was compelled under the plain error doctrine. After he lost his initial appeal, defendant filed a motion to correct the sentence on the grounds that it was illegal. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed the denial of his motion and raised the issue of the inconsistent application of the plain error rule. The court affirmed the denial of the motion to correct the sentence, holding that Rule 35 could not be used to challenge pre-sentence errors. Further, because the sentence was not in excess of the statutory maximum and was imposed by a court with jurisdiction, it was not illegal. The court also held that its application of the plain error doctrine had been consistent, noting that instructional error raised initially on direct appeal constituted reversible error only where the error complained of was so clearly prejudicial to the complainant's substantial rights as to jeopardize the very fairness and integrity of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed two judgments of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted him of driving while intoxicated in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-716(b)(1) (Supp. 1984), and which later revoked his probation after he failed to meet a condition of his suspended sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a vehicle collision, a police officer concluded from &quot;field sobriety tests&quot; that defendant was intoxicated. He was arrested and advised of his rights. He signed a form consenting to take a blood test, but refused to take a breath test. He again refused a breath test after consulting his attorney, who went with defendant and the officer to the hospital. The attorney then agreed to a breath test, which was refused, and a blood sample was forcibly taken. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied. He was convicted, sentenced to 30 days in jail, and fined $ 200. The sentence was suspended on the condition that he complete a traffic alcohol program, which he failed to do. Probation was revoked and the sentence was served. On appeal, his challenges to the taking of the blood sample were held meritless. His request for a breath test after twice refusing was unreasonable. His argument that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering him to appear for a status hearing was both frivolous and moot. The appeal of the order revoking probation was moot as he had served the sentence. The conviction was affirmed, and the appeal from the order revoking probation was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court convicting defendant of driving while intoxicated, and dismissed as moot defendant's appeal from the judgment revoking his probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer brought an action against defendants, city and police officials, seeking damages and equitable relief for false arrest, malicious prosecution, defamation, and under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Superior Court for the District of Columbia entered a damages judgment for the officer. In a post-trial hearing, the officer was awarded attorney's fees and costs under &sect; 1988, and equitable relief. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer sought reversal of the trial court's failure to grant his motion to correct the judgment or for a new trial on damages. Defendants sought reversal of the judgments. The court affirmed the judgments except for that which denied the officer's motion with respect to back pay, benefits, and attorney's fees. The trial court erred in failing to award back pay, as juror affidavits showed that the jury was confused by the verdict form. The trial court did not submit the issue of retroactive promotion to the jury, having reserved the question to itself. Thus, the jury had no basis for determining back pay when making its lump sum award. The trial court erred in reducing the officer's attorneys' hourly rate by extrapolating that rate from government pay scales. The rate should have been determined from the prevailing rate in the private sector. The trial court erred in reducing the attorney's fee award by 20 percent. The case was not a variety garden tort case. The officer's action was the first &sect; 1983 action that had ever been tried before the trial court, the availability of state or local law remedies was improperly considered, and the officer success was not limited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments that awarded plaintiff damages and equitable relief in his action against defendants for false arrest, malicious prosecution, defamation, and civil rights violations. The court reversed that portion of the judgments that adjusted the award of plaintiffs' attorney's fees and failed to award back pay and benefits, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 47-2820 (1981) and two counts of operating a business without a certificate of occupancy under D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 8104.1 (1982).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the co-owner of a swinger's club, was convicted of maintaining a public hall without a license and operating a business without a certificate of occupancy following an investigation in which undercover officers found movie and video equipment and dancing. On appeal, defendant contended that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-2820(b) covering &quot;entertainments of any description&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, that the activities were only incidental to the club's more erotic activities, and that the 30-day jail sentence was harsh. The court vacated the jail sentence for failing to have a certificate of occupancy; however, the court affirmed the other convictions, concluding that dancing and the showing of moving pictures played a significant part in the club's operations and that those activities required a license under &sect; 47-2820(a), (b). The court also held that defendant's sentence for operating without a license was well within the 90-day maximum but that failure to have a certificate of occupancy was punishable only by a fine under D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 11, &sect; 8105.1 (1982). However, because the sentences were all concurrent, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim became frustrated during an attempt to purchase marijuana and said that he would shoot everybody in the area if he had a weapon.

The victim testified that he saw defendant with a gun. As the victim ran threw the woods, he was shot in the leg. During trial, one of the jurors sustained an injury in a fall. He informed the trial court that he felt fine and was able to participate in deliberations. The jury retired for 40 minutes. The following day, the juror failed to appear and the trial court replaced him with an alternate. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in seating an alternate juror after the jury had already retired to deliberate. The court determined that a reversal was required because the trial court, over objection, substituted an alternate juror once the jury had retired to deliberate in violation of D.C. Super. Ct. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board conducted an administrative hearing at which the former police officer was present.

Upon reviewing the record, the court concluded that the Board's findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by substantial evidence. The Board's application of &sect; 4-620(a) was consistent with the statutory scheme established by Congress, and was not arbitrary or capricious. While the court agreed that the former police officer had a property interest in his annuity, the court could not say that the application of &sect; 4-620(a) to him impaired this right. Accordingly, the court found no constitutional basis for reversal.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 22-703 (1981) after the complaining witness, a career prostitute, accused defendant of demanding that she sodomize him or be arrested for prostitution. The police internal affairs division recorded her subsequent conversations with defendant. The trial judge found that her consent to the recording was involuntary because the police wore her down until she agreed to cooperate, ignored her desire to be left alone, and exploited her vulnerability as a prostitute. The court reversed, holding that the trial court's finding was not supported by substantial evidence because the complaining witness made the first contact with the police, indicated willingness to discuss the matter away from her home after speaking to her husband, and told the police about subsequent encounters with defendant. The court held that the consent was voluntary because no improper inducement or coercive threats were visited upon the complaining witness, who knew what the police were about and willingly participated therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant's main contention was that the trial court should accept his version of the facts as true. The trial court, however, credited the arresting officer's testimony instead and rejected defendant's account of what happened. On appeal, the court noted that it could not rely on defendant's testimony. The court held that it must accept the trial court's findings because they were amply supported by the evidence under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 17-305(a) (1981). Defendant presented arguments on appeal that he had not presented at trial. Since none of these arguments were presented to the trial court, the court held that it would have to find plain error before it could reverse defendant's conviction. The offense proscribed by D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2701 consisted of inviting, enticing, or persuading another to engage in prostitution, or attempting to do so. Under the statute it made no difference which party did the inviting, enticing, or persuading, and there was no authority that would justify the use of different standards of proof.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the prior representation was not substantially related to the underlying litigation. It affirmed the board's decision not to disqualify the attorneys or the firm. It reasoned that even if the attorneys' had been prohibited from representing a particular party, other attorneys in their firm could have handled the case if the attorneys had been properly screened.

The appellate court disagreed with each contention and affirmed the decision. The District could regulate the business activities of its educational institutions. Its interest was not aimed at suppressing speech but in preventing the harms that arise when such institutions abuse their degree-conferring authority. The statute furthered a substantial interest and its effect on speech and academic freedom was no greater than necessary to protect that interest.

When notified that the association planned to foreclose upon his property, the owner filed an action against the association, which included a claim that by returning his previous payment the association had breached a settlement agreement and its fiduciary duties. The association sought summary judgment on the grounds that no such agreement existed, which was granted. The owner appealed, and the court reversed the grant of summary judgment on the breach of contract and fiduciary duty claim.

R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 4612.1 (1982), from receiving unemployment compensation benefits on the ground that she left her most recent job voluntarily and without good cause connected with the work.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department issued a final decision disqualifying petitioner from receiving unemployment benefits. On appeal, the court affirmed, reasoning that, under &sect; 46-111(a), petitioner was not eligible for benefits because she left her work voluntarily to follow her spouse to a new location. Her resignation was based upon a desire to maintain the family and was not the consequence of a good cause connected with the work. The court rejected petitioner's argument that &sect; 46-111(a) was unconstitutional in that it discriminated against her on the basis of sex. While a wife might more often relocate to accommodate a spouse's career choices, such fact alone did not establish that &sect; 46-111(a), or the manner in which it was applied, discriminated unconstitutionally against petitioner in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Petitioner offered no evidence that she was treated differently from a male claimant who voluntarily quit his job to relocate with his wife in another state. The legislature's denial of compensation to those who left their jobs without good cause connected with the work was rationally related to legitimate objectives of limiting costs and creating workforce stability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The undertaker's license was revoked when his unlicensed employee picked up the bodies of fetuses and left them in a van, allowing a dog to enter and drag the fetuses into an alley. On appeal, the court affirmed because, while the board erred in finding that the undertaker had violated certain regulations, the court would nevertheless have revoked the undertaker's license. By allowing an unlicensed person to perform the duties of the undertaker, the undertaker himself was guilty of culpable fault. The court held that D.C.

R. &amp; Regs. tit. 5N, &sect; 1.1, which defined the duties of an undertaker as moving dead bodies for burial, taken together, put the undertaker on notice that he could not permit his employee to pick up dead bodies. The court held that D.C. R. &amp; Regs. tit. 5N, &sect; 12.1, which prohibited undertakers from engaging in unseemly conduct, referred only to conduct designed to solicit or procure business, but it held that the board's reliance in part upon the asserted violation of &sect; 12.1 was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from judgments of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted them as accessories after the fact to first- degree murder. The first defendant also appealed from a conviction for two counts of perjury, and the second defendant appealed from a conviction for grand larceny and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted as accessories before the fact to the assassination of an Iranian dissident. The first defendant argued that the trial court erroneously allowed hearsay statements into evidence under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule. The court concluded that the hearsay statements should not have been admitted because independent nonhearsay evidence presented by the government to establish a conspiracy involving that defendant was not sufficient to make the existence of a conspiracy &quot;more likely than not,&quot; and reversed the first defendant's conviction as an accessory. The court also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support that conviction. The conviction of the second defendant as an accessory was supported by sufficient evidence and was affirmed. The trial court's denial of the second defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence that the government should have turned over under the Jencks Act was harmless error, not grounds for reversal. The statute under which the second defendant was sentenced, which referred to a &quot;crime punishable by death,&quot; was not judicially repealed by the Supreme Court decision in Furman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction of the first defendant as an accessory after the fact to first degree murder was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of a judgment acquitting him of that charge. His conviction for perjury was affirmed. The conviction of the second defendant as an accessory after the fact was affirmed, as was his conviction for grand larceny, and his conviction for unauthorized used of a vehicle was remanded to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dentist filed an action against defendants, corporation and dentist, alleging breach of stock purchase and employment agreements, unjust enrichment, and that defendant dentist had individually slandered him. Defendants counterclaimed alleging unlawful departure. The trial court granted a judgment against defendants, but refused to award plaintiff damages for slander against defendant corporation. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that plaintiff was entitled to damages for unjust enrichment even though he had recovered recission damages because the evidence indicated defendants benefited from plaintiff's efforts in expanding the practice. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence establishing defendants repudiated the agreement where defendant dentist wrote a letter to plaintiff stating he was freezing plaintiff's right to buy into the practice and was adjusting the price upward. The court held that plaintiff's slander claim against defendant corporation was properly denied where defendant was not placed on notice that issue was being tried until closing arguments and a post-trial amendment would have deprived defendant of its day in court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that defendant entered the Senate chamber as a visiting member of the public, and unfurled a nine foot banner over the railing, which displayed a provocative message. The court further found that defendant previously had caused a similar disruption of a session of the House of Representatives. Defendant said that he intended to draw attention to himself in the Senate gallery in order to express certain convictions to members of Congress. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that defendant had to have the specific intent to violate the law with knowledge of the statute's existence. The court rejected defendant's argument, and affirmed his conviction. The court held that because defendant had taken actions, which were obviously disruptive, with the specific intent to cause a disruption of Congress, it was sufficient to constitute a violation of D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a pet store. On a hot summer day, a cruelty investigator for a humane society notified the police that the animals in defendant's unventilated display window were getting overheated. When defendant refused to remove an overheated rabbit from the window, the police restrained defendant and removed the rabbit. The treating veterinarian testified that the rabbit suffered from heat stroke. The court affirmed, holding that the warrantless entry and seizure of the rabbit were constitutionally reasonable under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. The court held that the realities of the situation were such that a warrant could not have been obtained without imperiling the life of the animal that defendant refused to remove from the window. Moreover, the need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury was justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency. Although the protection of animal rather than human life was involved, the court believed that the &quot;public interest&quot; in the prevention of cruelty to animals required some flexibility in the application of the warrant requirement.</SPAN></P>

The commission denied the agency's motion for a declaratory ruling, which sought to shield ratepayers from the utility increases engendered by the settlement. On appeal, the court dismissed the agency's petition of appeal and determined that it did not have statutory authority to review the commission's denial of the agency's motion for a declaratory order pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-1508 (1981). The court stated that the substantive rulings from the commission's order were not subject to judicial review because the commission was vested with discretion to issue a declaratory order upon an applicant's proposal. The court concluded that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-1508 controlled in the agency's petition because the reviewability of the commission's action concerned the availability of review and not the scope or the procedure by which it was secured pursuant to D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the marriage, the husband worked as a foreign service officer. In December 1979, the parties formally separated in contemplation of divorce. The trial court granted the husband a judgment of absolute divorce and merged into the decree a previously executed separation and property settlement agreement. In that agreement, the wife released all claims that she had to her husband's retirement benefits. Congress subsequently amended the law to allow a former spouse to obtain a portion of those benefits. The trial court awarded the wife her statutory share of the benefits despite the waiver of those rights after it found that the waiver only applied to then known and existing rights, and not to an interest in benefits created by the subsequent legislation. The husband argued that his wife had waived her rights to his retirement annuity and survivor benefits and that Congress did not intend to retroactively disturb the contractual obligations of the parties. The court agreed, so it reversed and remanded the case to the trial court solely to order amendment of the divorce decree to delete the wife's interest in the retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's pet store was investigated after a citizen complaint and a search warrant was obtained upon a preliminary report of dehydrated, underweight puppies in poor condition. The search warrant was executed and 15 puppies in similarly bad shape were seized. Defendant was charged and convicted of cruelty to animals under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-801(2) (1981). On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence, even where the search warrant was based on a provision of the cruelty to animals statute that the motions judge declared unconstitutional, because the evidence was still admissible under the &quot;unnecessarily failing to provide&quot; portion of the statute. Nor were the words &quot;unnecessarily&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; so indefinite as to render unconstitutionally vague the provision of the statute that called for the punishment of anyone who unnecessarily failed to provide an animal in one's custody with proper food, drink, water, shelter, and protection from the weather. To require more precision would have been to require the legislature to draft a detailed code on the care and feeding of animals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation counsel instituted an action to establish paternity and seek support pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2342 for two minor children born out of wedlock. The district court dismissed the case stating the 2-year period of limitations had passed. The corporation counsel appealed from the decision arguing the period of limitations in the statute was unconstitutional because it discriminated impermissibly against children born out of wedlock. The reviewing court found that children born out of wedlock had to bring paternity actions within 2 years of birth, or forever forfeit the right to obtain that support. The reviewing court found that the child, not the parties who failed to undertake timely action on the child's behalf, suffered as a result. In addition, the statute thwarted the effectiveness of the statute that was designed to ensure that whenever possible the primary burden for the support of children born out of wedlock should fall on the parents, not the government. Therefore, the reviewing court concluded the children born out of wedlock were denied the equal protection of the law and declared the statute unconstitutional. The decision was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated by the 25-month hiatus between his arrest and trial, and defendant asserted his speedy trial right promptly and frequently. The court concluded that, notwithstanding the gravity of the offenses with which defendant was charged, defendant's speedy trial right was denied. Thus, the court reversed defendant's convictions and remanded the case for dismissal of the indictment. Applying the &quot;sensitive balancing test,&quot; the court concluded that defendant's right to a speedy trial intolerably was denied. The court found that the 25-month delay was entirely attributable to the government. The governmental indifference to defendant's clearly asserted speedy trial right in failing to move for expedited consideration of its appeal resulted in a significant charge against it of 11 months. Defendant promptly pressed his right and the subsequent delay was lengthy. In addition, defendant suffered prejudice from his detention in jail for the entire pretrial period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District of Columbia Board on Professional Responsibility (the board) petitioned this court for the temporary suspension of respondent attorney from the practice of law pursuant to D.C. Bar R. XI, &sect; 3(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its petition for the temporary suspension of the attorney the board put forth evidence that the attorney had violated Model Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 6-101(A)(3) by neglecting three legal matters entrusted to him, DR 7-101 (A)(1), (2) by failing to seek the lawful objectives of three clients, DR 2-110 (A)(3) by abandoning two clients and refusing to refund their fees, and DR 1-102 (A)(5) by ignoring the disciplinary process. The board also submitted several affidavits and other documents reflecting serious misappropriation of client funds by the attorney. The court granted the board's petition for temporary suspension. The court held that temporary suspension, much like a temporary injunction in a civil action, was an extraordinary remedy to be imposed only upon a showing of irreparable harm and that likelihood that a significant sanction will be imposed. The court needed to also consider whether the balance of injuries favored temporary suspension and whether the public interest would have been served. The court determined that based upon the facts of this case with complaints in five separate cases, temporary suspension was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the attorney temporarily suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia. The attorney was denied access to any client funds without prior approval from the board. The board's request for an order requiring respondent to submit to an audit of his financial records was denied without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought refunds for taxes paid in 1975. After the trial court ruled that timely individual administrative claims were a prerequisite to collecting refunds under &sect;47-1586j, that interest was to be computed from the date of the individual claims, and that a claim for refund on behalf of a class did not comply with &sect;47-1586j, the taxpayers filed a petition for a rehearing. The court denied the petition. The taxpayers did not appeal from a 1977 order that required compliance with &sect;47-1586j, or a 1979 order that ruled that a claim for a refund on behalf of the class did not comply with &sect;47-1586j. Both orders were final and appealable. Tolling was not proper because the orders were not appealed. For the class action, the fact that the taxpayers pursued various avenues for notifying individual taxpayers of the &sect;47-1586j requirement indicated that the taxpayers understood the 1977 order, literally read, to require individual claims. The filing deadline for the 1975 tax year did not expire until 1979, so equitable tolling was not appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions asserting that the evidence was insufficient to withstand his motion for judgment of acquittal. The court affirmed on all counts except that pertaining to the alteration of identifying marks on a weapon as that conviction was premised upon an unconstitutional statutory inference. The court noted that it would not reverse a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal unless there was no evidence upon which a reasonable person could fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A conviction under D.C. Code &sect; 22-3203 required the government to show that defendant had the required possessory or ownership interest, in a pistol, within the District of Columbia, having been previously convicted of a felony. Satisfactory proof of the possessory or ownership interest existed where the government showed that defendant did own, possess or have control of a gun. The court noted that the statute allowed the jury to infer that a person possessing a weapon which had had its identifying marks altered was in fact the person who actually altered those marks. But given the ease with which weapons changed hands, it was not a valid inference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a porter in a building where a woman was killed. Evidence showed that he obtained a key to her apartment, stole some of her property, engaged the help of another person in concealing such property, and abandoned the victim's car in a park with her dead body inside. The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request to represent himself because defendant asserted that right near the end of the government's case and at a critical time of the trial. The record did not support defendant's claim that police procedures during eyewitness identification were unnecessarily suggestive. Because defendant entered the apartment earlier and removed a screen to gain re-entry, the jury could reasonably have concluded that defendant committed the crime with premeditation and deliberation. The court remanded for re-sentencing. Because there was only one death, the trial court could only impose sentence on either the felony-murder charge or the underlying felony.

The trial court committed the child to social services, and three months later he was placed in foster care.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband was employed by the federal government as a pressman for 35 years, and the wife worked as a domestic during much of the marriage. Pursuant to the husband and wife's divorce proceedings, the trial court awarded the wife a portion of the husband's civil service pension benefits. However, the trial court denied the wife's request for alimony and did not rule on her request for an attorney fee. The court remanded for the limited purpose of consideration of the attorney fee request and affirmed the judgment in all other respects. The court held that the pension benefits constituted marital property and that the trial court did not improperly give retroactive application of the applicable state and federal statutes to the husband's pension. Therefore, the award did not violate the contract clause and due process clause of the United States Constitution. The trial court's opinion demonstrated that it fully considered the relevant factors when determining that alimony for the wife was inappropriate, and that conclusion was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment for the wife as to the pension benefits issue and in favor of the husband as to alimony was affirmed. The court remanded for a consideration of the attorney fee request.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with, inter alia, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxciating liquor. D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-716(b) (1981). Pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-104(a)(1), appellant government sought review of an order of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which denied its pretrial motion to introduce evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test following his arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In arriving at its decision denying the government's pretrial motion to introduce evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test, the trial court found that defendant had a right to refuse the test pursuant to the court's holding in the Stuart case. However, the statute upon which Stuart had been decided was repealed, and in its place Congress enacted the District of Columbia Implied Consent Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-501 to 40-507 (1981) with the avowed purpose of substantially strengthening the District's control of the drinking driver by lessening the difficulty in obtaining a conviction for driving under the influence. The court thus determined that the Stuart case was no longer applicable in light of the new legislation and the fact that it no longer provided an unqualified right to refuse to submit to a breathalyzer test. Given that failure to submit to a breathalyzer test resulted in a six-month revocation of a driver's license under the Act, characterization of the option of refusing as a &quot;right&quot; was deemed inappropriate. Therefore, the court held that the failure of defendant to submit to the breathalyzer test should be admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment denying the government's pretrial motion to introduce evidence of defendant's refusal to take a breathalyzer test.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners contended that the zoning proceedings were tainted because the ex-government attorneys representing the developer had previously litigated against him on the same matter while in public office. The court held that pursuant to the Model Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 9-101(B), a lawyer should not have accepted private employment in connection with any matter in which he or she participated substantially as a public officer. The court held that the determinative factor in applying DR 9-101(B) was whether the two actions were &quot;substantially related.&quot; The court held that the commonality of facts, principles, and parties, legally rendered the proceedings substantially related. The court concluded that notwithstanding other differences, the fundamentals were the same, as they both involved securing rentable space for the same property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government refused to allow the lienholder to have possession of an automobile without payment of impound and storage fees required by D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-703(k) (1981). The lienholder filed suit for replevin and argued that it was not required to pay the fees imposed upon the &quot;owner or other duly authorized person&quot; under the statute. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the government. The lienholder appealed and the court reversed. The court noted that it had previously construed the words &quot;owner or other authorized person&quot; under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-703(k)(A) (1981) and related to parking violations to exclude chattel mortgagees. The court declined to construe the same words any differently with regard to impound and storage fees under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 40-703(k)(B) (1981). Because a lienholder did not receive notice of an impoundment until late in the process and after the impound and storage fees had already been incurred, the court seriously doubted whether the construction of the statute urged by the government could withstand a due process challenge. In any event, the court concluded that the lienholder was not liable for the impound and storage fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of possession of implements of crime, i.e., narcotics paraphernalia, and reckless driving. A lower appellate court reversed the possession conviction after finding there was insufficient evidence to support it.

The court held that there was sufficient evidence that defendant had constructive possession of drug paraphernalia where items were found in plan view and within defendant's proximity and there was evidence that there was an on-going criminal operation of which the possession was a part of. Moreover, the court found that defendant's act of fleeing from the police was further evidence of defendant's consciousness of guilt.

The landlord filed its hardship petition pursuant to D.C. Code &sect;&sect; 45-1687(c), -1693 (Supp. VII 1980), and requested a rent ceiling adjustment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission found that the landlord had not presented sufficient evidence to justify the increase it requested. The commission also held that the petition should have been supported by externally generated evidence of actual payment of debts, such as cancelled checks, as opposed to evidence of the mere incurrence of expenses. The landlord argued that past hardship petitions by landlords had been granted on similar evidence and that this requirement violated an established, if informal, agency practice and worked a hardship on the landlord. On appeal, the court rejected the landlord's arguments and affirmed the commission's decision. The court held that D.C. Code &sect; 1-1509(b) (1981) placed the burden of proof on the landlord. The court held that the factfinder's requirement of external verification of the payment of claimed expenses was reasonable because the landlord's cancelled checks evidencing payment of its expenses were generally available to and within the control of the landlord. The court held that the landlord had notice that externally generated evidence of payment of debts was necessary to verify the expenses it had listed in its petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">White foster parents and black grandparents filed competing petitions for adoption of a two-year-old black child who had been given up for adoption by the child's mother without the consent of its father and had been placed with the white foster parents. Purporting to apply all factors identified in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-305 (1973), including race, the trial court granted the black grandparents an interlocutory decree of adoption as in the best interest of the child. The white foster parents claimed that the equal protection doctrine of the Constitution prohibited the use of skin-color-defined race as a relevant factor in an adoption proceeding. The court held that the statutory provision making race relevant survived a &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard of review as long as race was not used as a presumptive basis for deciding adoption disputes, but was only considered relevant to the larger issue of the child's best interest. The court reversed because the trial court's analysis did not provide the reasoning and detail necessary to assure the court that the evaluation of race by the trial court was tailored to the best interest of the child.</SPAN></P>

Because pretrial detention under &sect; 23-1325(a) was reasonably related to the legitimate governmental objective of preventing flight and/or harm to the community, the ordered detention defendants charged with first-degree murder did not constitute punishment. The court held that the application of &sect; 23-1325(a) was not an ex post facto violation because no punishment was imposed and &sect; 23-1325(a) did not make formerly legal conduct a crime, or change the elements of murder or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unwed father appealed from the superior court's decision to refuse his request for custody of his young child and to permit another family to adopt the child. The court noted that D.C.

The court rejected the unwed father's assertion that &sect; 16-304(e) violated the Due Process Clause because it did not require a finding that the natural parent was unfit. The court held that ordering adoption over the objection of the natural parent, and without a determination that the natural parent was unfit, was constitutionally permissible if it was the least detrimental available alternative. The unwed father's substantive due process rights were not abridged by the superior court order granting adoption of the young child based on the determination of the best interests of the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner utilities sought review of an order of respondent Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia which assessed fees directly against the utilities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utilities sought review of fees assessed against them by the commission under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 43-612(a). The court reversed the decision of the commission because it found that the commission had construed the terms &quot;valuation&quot; and &quot;rate case&quot; contrary to the plain meaning of the statute. The valuation was important for determining that ceiling of the assessments. The court found that the commission was determining the &quot;valuation&quot; in ratemaking proceedings in lieu of a separate D.C. Code &sect; 43-508 valuation proceeding, and the valuation that was occurring was on a jurisdictional basis, rather than a system-wide basis. A jurisdictional valuation encompassed property located outside the boundaries of the District of Columbia. The court also found that D.C. Code &sect; 43-612(a) distinguished between valuation and rate cases and all other types of investigations by the commission. The court found that the &quot;rate case&quot; referred to a specific proceeding, and common usage of the term was too broad. The court concluded that defining the term &quot;rate case&quot; was not within the commission's discretion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the Traffic Regulations for the United States Capitol Grounds art. 10, &sect; 47(b)(2) was unconstitutional and, therefore, his refusal to leave the capitol grounds did not constitute unlawful entry. The court reversed defendant's convictions and held that, although, &sect; 47(b)(2) was facially constitutional, the regulation was nonetheless unconstitutionally applied to defendant. Section 47(b)(2) was unconstitutionally applied to defendant in light of the lack of evidence that he actually or potentially interfered with the traffic on the capitol grounds. The trial court's interpretation, which allowed the exigencies inherent in enforcement to convert an otherwise protected mode of expression into proscribed conduct, constituted a restriction of defendant's First Amendment freedom greater than was essential to plaintiff government's interest in unimpeded traffic flow.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the commission's ratemaking decisions because they were not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. The court found that the rate design established by the commission was based upon sound ratemaking principles and was amply supported by the evidence. Both cost and non-cost factors adequately supported the class-based differences in the approved rates. Further, the return on equity authorized by the commission's rate design was within the &quot;zone of reasonableness&quot; and was not confiscatory. The commission's finding that electric company bear the burden of demonstrating way ratepayers should bear the cost of institutional advertising expenses was not unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory.

The court affirmed the convictions, ruling that the senior secret service officer was empowered as the lawful occupant to demand appellants quit the premises; therefore the informations properly charged appellants with violating &sect; 22-3102. The court held that appellants failed to show that enforcement of the unlawful entry statute was content-based, or applied in other than an even-handed fashion.

Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(d)(2) (1981), after finding him not guilty by reason of insanity under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(d) (1981). Defendant had been charged with destruction of property under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-403 (1981), and attempted second-degree burglary under D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 22-103-1801.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In what the trial court termed an extraordinary set of circumstances, it ordered defendant committed under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(d)(1) (1981), but then immediately released him on the basis that he was not longer a danger to himself or others. On appeal, the government contended that the trial court was without authority to release defendant unconditionally pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(d). The government asserted that once defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity, it had no choice but to direct an actual commitment to a hospital for the mentally ill with eligibility for release to be determined at a subsequent hearing. The court held that the government's position was correct. D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(d)(1) provided that any person who successfully raised an insanity defense was to be committed to a hospital for the mentally ill until such time as he was eligible for release. Defendant asserted that automatic commitment was only mandatory until the time as he was found eligible for release. He argued that his eligibility was established at the time of the verdict and thus, no actual commitment was required. The court held actual commitment was mandatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of the order from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which dismissed with prejudice her paternity and support actions filed in Maryland and subsequently certified and transmitted to the District in accordance with the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA). The trial court held that the actions were time-barred under D.C. Code &sect; 16-2342 (Supp. 1978) and Md. Ann. Code &sect; 16-66(e) (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought an action under URESA to determine paternity and obtain support for her two children. The trial court applied Maryland law and District of Columbia (the District) law in the alternative, and dismissed the actions involving the child who was over the age of two years. On appeal, the court held that while a URESA initiating state made a cursory determination as to the facial merits of a claim under its own law, the responding state had an obligation to make a de novo determination that an obligor owed a duty of support before setting the amount. The court held that the trial court should have applied the law of the District to determine whether the father had such a duty. The court examined D.C. Code &sect; 16-2342 (Supp. 1978) and held that it only applied to two situations under D.C. Code &sect; 11-1101(3), (11) (1981): to enforce support of a person and to determine paternity of any child born out of wedlock. However, the court found that D.C. Code &sect; 11-1101(10) gave the trial court its jurisdiction. Therefore, D.C. Code &sect; 16-2342 (Supp. 1978) did not apply although paternity was involved. The court held that there was no statute of limitations on URESA actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court that dismissed the mother's URESA action for her older child as time-barred.

The trial court denied the motions. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that even though &sect; 22-505(a) stated that assaults against a correctional officer occurring within the District &quot;or elsewhere&quot; were punishable by the trial court, the questionable constitutionality of the &quot;or elsewhere&quot; language was without recourse for defendant because he was convicted of assaulting an officer within the District of Columbia.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the board's consideration of a cafe owner's liquor license application, the business owners attempted to introduce evidence that the cafe owner once ran a gift shop, located above the cafe that allegedly sold drug paraphernalia.

On appeal, the court affirmed the order holding that the board had not abused its discretion in excluding the evidence. The court found that the testimony was irrelevant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 25-115(a)(6) (1973) because the gift shop was no longer in existence and there was nothing unreasonable in construing the application of &quot;appropriateness of surroundings&quot; to include only existing surroundings, not past or former surroundings. The court also determined that the board's interpretation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 25-115(a)(1) (1973), excluding the testimony as to the cafe owner's character, was reasonable because the only evidence relevant to the inquiry was that of illegal activity and the gift shop's sale of water pipes and rolling papers was legal.</SPAN></P>

After the superior court transferred him back to the prison, the felon appealed. The court affirmed. The felon's rights were not violated by his retransfer. The procedure fully satisfied the requirements of the 1964 Hospitalization of the Mentally Ill Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-501 et seq. (1973), and the United States Constitution. The felon received daily medication in prison. The claim that the felon was entitled to treatment to maintain a remission of his illness in the hospital, rather than at the prison, did not rise to the same level as the liberty interest involved in a transfer from a prison to a mental hospital. The hospital authorities decided that treatment there was no longer necessary. The felon had the burden of persuasion and the burden of proof. The felon was restored to mental health to the extent that he was discharged from the hospital and returned to the prison, where he received the therapy necessary to maintain his illness in a state of remission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant permitted his employee, a qualified paramedic, to examine and treat patients without consultation and with minimal supervision. On appeal, the court held that a statute exempting the accepted use of qualified paramedical personnel from proscription of aiding and abetting another in the practice of healing art without a license survived a constitutional vagueness attack. The court reasoned that adequate notice of what constituted &quot;accepted use&quot; was supplied by reading the statute along with the custom and usage of the medical profession, its readily available policies and regulations, and knowledge presumably held by the licensed practitioner. The court further held that defendant, who allowed the paramedic to fill out and distribute drug prescriptions, which had been presigned, and who did not require that the paramedic seek his approval before prescribing drugs was able to reasonably comprehend that his conduct was not an accepted used of qualified paramedical personnel. Thus, defendant was not exempt from the statutory prohibition against aiding and abetting another in the practice of healing art without a license.</SPAN></P>

Each time, the board refused to accept the bill. The referendum committee filed suits challenging the board's refusals. The trial court entered three judgments. Specifically, the trial court (1) upheld the board's decision rejecting the proposed bill pursuant to the Dixon Amendment; (2) declined to issue a preliminary injunction; and (3) granted summary judgment for the board. The referendum committee appealed. The court affirmed the judgments. The referendum committee's initiatives did propose a law because the district council properly could have passed an act having the same effect as the initiative. However, the initiative was barred by the exception precluding initiatives for laws appropriating funds. Because the Dixon Amendment comported with this limitation on the initiative right, the board's reliance thereon was entirely proper. Because the initiative, as circulated on petitions, could not have lawfully been changed in any material respect for submission to the voters, the board was correct in rejecting the second and third initiative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged judgments from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which upheld the constitutionality of D.C. Police Regs. art. 25, &sect; 16, prohibiting the possession of a police radar detector in a motor vehicle. The trial court had refused to dismiss informations against defendants. Defendants contended that the regulation violated the Supremacy Clause, the Commerce Clause, and the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants alleged that the regulation of radar detectors by the states was preempted by the Federal Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. In affirming the trial court's judgment, however, the court ruled that there was no direct conflict between the police regulation and the Act. Moreover, the court ruled that the regulation did not stand as an obstacle to full enforcement of the Act. Thus, the regulation was not invalid under the Supremacy Clause. The court also ruled that the Commerce Clause did not invalidate the regulation because states had the power to regulate matters of interstate commerce where highway safety was concerned. As long as the safety justifications were not illusory, a court would not second guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison with related burdens of interstate commerce. Because radar detectors had no utility except to allow drivers to evade punishment for speeding, no unreasonable burden on interstate commerce existed. Finally, the causal link between prohibiting the use of radar detectors and protecting the public safety was sufficient to support the reasonableness of the regulation on due process grounds.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. After a hearing, the superior court denied the motion. The court considered both appeals and affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err when it: (1) refused to grant defendant's motion for mistrial when his objection to testimony regarding a prior conviction for rape in another jurisdiction was overruled; (2) instructed the jury that defendant had to prove his insanity defense by a preponderance of the evidence; (3) refused to instruct the jury that it could consider evidence of defendant's impaired mental condition with regard to the charge of first-degree murder to negate the elements of premeditation, deliberation, and specific intent; and (4) refused to approve defendant's request to waive a jury trial.

Defendant replied that the fee quoted over the phone was just for a nude massage and that sexual acts would cost more. After discussing the prices of explicit sexual acts, the officer placed defendant under arrest. Defendant was convicted of sexual solicitation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that a constitutional right of privacy protected solicitation for prostitution in a private area between two consenting adults. The court held that there was no fundamental right to privacy for commercial sexual solicitation. The court ruled that although the United States Supreme Court had recognized that the constitutional right to privacy for certain intimate conduct extended beyond the home to a hotel room, this right did not extend to commercial sexual solicitation. Commercial sex did not concern an intimate relationship of the sort deemed worthy of constitutional protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the child was less than three months old, she was admitted to a hospital with injuries to three of her limbs, probably as the result of a twisting motion imparted to the arm and legs. At the same time, the mother was admitted to a hospital with a diagnosis of schizo-affective schizophrenia. The mother had spent approximately 9-1/2 of the preceding 10 years in that institution due to mental illness. The child's representative filed a motion to terminate the parent and child relationship. The trial court entered an order granting the motion. On appeal, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's having proceeded without the mother. The situation which was faced by the trial court was provided for expressly in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2359(a) (Supp. 1978), and the court found no error in the procedure followed. The court found meritless the mother's assertion that she was deprived of the Fifth Amendment's due process guarantees because the trial court terminated her parental rights solely due to the fact that she suffered from a mental illness.

(1973), the tenant's right to remain on the landlord's premises was dependent on his payment of rent. The court found that the inability to pay rent because of indigency was not a defense to a possessory action based on nonpayment. The court found that the right to housing was not so fundamental as to permit the tenant, as a matter of constitutional right, from asserting the inability to pay rent as a defense. The court held that it would have been unjust to permit the tenant to continue to occupy the landlord's property. The court found that if the litigation would have continued with no funds in the trial court's registry and with the tenant in possession, the landlord could have been deprived of funds that legally belonged to it. The court held that while the striking of the tenant's answer resulted in the termination of the tenancy, it did not otherwise foreclose his rights because he remained free to sue for breach of contract in the civil division.</SPAN></P>

The property owner applied for a demolish permit to demolish the building in order to construct a office building. The mayor's agent considered testimony and arguments bearing on the issue of unreasonable economic hardship to the owner which would occur if the application was denied, which it was. The court concluded that if there was a reasonable alternative economic use for the property after the imposition of the restriction, there was no taking, and thus no unreasonable economic hardship to the owners, no matter how diminished the property may be. The property owner had the burden of proof in the hearing to establish that no other reasonable economic use for the building existed.

The patient sought review of an order of the trial court denying his request for immediate release or, in the alternative, civil commitment pursuant to D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that because he had been detained beyond the maximum period for which he could have been imprisoned for the offense of which he was acquitted, his continued confinement denied him equal protection of the laws. After several rehearings, the court considered again the patient's equal protection claim, but held that he was not entitled to automatic release from the hospital on the expiration of his hypothetical maximum prison sentence because &sect; 24-301(d), in making provision for continued confinement of acquittees, did not refer at all to a hypothetical maximum prison sentence or any judicially limited commitment term; it only required consideration of mental illness and dangerousness. Absent specific objections to conditions of confinement or claims of inadequate or discriminatory treatment, the court evaluated the patient's equal protection claim by considering whether the scheme created by &sect; 24-301(d) had a rational basis. Because the differences in that scheme and the involuntary commitment scheme under &sect; 21-545(b) were justifiable and not substantial, the court found no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the terms of the trial judge's order came very close to creating a situation where administration of the center was in the hands of the judicial branch. The court concluded that the complaint of one or two, or even four juveniles, did not give the trial court license to undertake a broad and detailed inquiry into the operation of the entire facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, the government sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which denied the pretrial detention of defendant when the government refused to present a complaining witness for cross-examination. Defendant challenged the trial court's subsequent ruling granting the government's motion for pretrial detention. He also challenged the constitutionality of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1322 (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended, inter alia, that the pretrial detention proceedings violated his constitutional right to bail, his right to a fair trial, and his right to due process. The court held that pretrial detention without bail did not violate the constitution because pretrial detention to prevent the repetition of dangerous acts under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1322(a)(1) sought to curtail reasonably predictable conduct and was not punishment for prior acts. The court also held that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1322 (1973) satisfied the minimum demands of procedural due process because it was analogous to a probable cause hearing following an arrest and the same liberty interests were at stake. The court found that &sect; 23-1322 was not unconstitutionally vague because pretrial detention had a substantial relation to preventing injury to the public. Section 23-1322 did not violate the overbreadth doctrine because the detainee had to be charged with the commission of a dangerous crime. However, the trial court's order closing the pretrial detention hearing to the media violated the First Amendment because the press and the public had a right to attend courtroom proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in granting the government's subsequent motion for the pretrial detention of defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted him of three counts of threats, in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2307 (1973), and four counts of obstructing justice, in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-703(a) (1973). Defendant was sentenced to concurrent 3 to 12-year sentences for each count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of threats and obstructing justice after four witnesses failed to appear for his scheduled trial for assault with a dangerous weapon. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court found that the 17-month delay between defendant's arrest and trial did not deprive him of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. His speedy trial right was not violated because he failed to assert his right until three days before trial, there was no evidence that he made any other request for expedited resolution of his trial, and he never objected to the trial court's granting of continuances during the trial or appeal. Absent any indications of prejudice to defendant or of deliberately dilatory governmental tactics, the court held that the government carried its burden of persuasion and that reversal was inappropriate. The court held that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment did not prohibit defendant's convictions for both offenses. Finally, the court found that legislative intent supported multiple punishment for defendant's convictions for both offenses on the basis of a single transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both of the child's parents were diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia. Among other things, they had abandoned the child in its stroller after arguing with pedestrians, were found to be high on drugs and standing in the middle of the street, and kept an exceedingly untidy and hazardous household. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the standard of proof under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2317(c)(2) (1973) was the preponderance of the evidence, but noted that the trial court had concluded that even if the standard was clear and convincing proof, this was satisfied. Clear and convincing proof was not required, however, as parental rights were not being terminated, and the intrusion into the father's personal life was not that great. The court next held that while the statute was quite broad, this did not mean it was vague, and because no First Amendment freedom was implicated, vagueness review was based on a relatively relaxed standard that considered all of the facts of the case at hand.</SPAN></P>

At a hearing on her petition for reinstatement, the attorney presented a picture of rehabilitation. The hearing committee was troubled, nonetheless, by the attorney's confusion about the ethical implications of her criminal acts but recommended her reinstatement after completion of a course in legal ethics. In denying the attorney's petition for reinstatement, the court held that, pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-2503(a)(1973), the attorney's disbarment for a crime of moral turpitude was mandatory and permanent. The fact that the attorney's conviction was pursuant to an Alford plea did not alter the result.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant had failed to present a prima facie case of any violation. With regard to the fair-cross section and equal protection challenges, defendant failed to show that the underrepresentation of Spanish surnamed persons was due to a systematic exclusion or that the selection system was susceptible to abuse or not racially neutral. It was not enough that defendant showed statistics. He had to produce evidence of an impermissible selection system to support an inference of intentional discrimination. The Act was not violated because defendant failed to show that the group was underrepresented by systematic exclusion or purposeful discrimination. The court held that after defendant had offered evidence of his good character and the victim's bad character, the prosecutor was properly allowed to impeach, through a rebuttal witness, the good character evidence. The prosecutor's improper remarks regarding the unavailability of the death penalty did not warrant a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All charges against defendants allegedly grew out of a demonstration protesting the visit of a foreign leader.

Thereafter, the sought and obtained a third superseding indictment, charging all defendants of a 26 count indictment. Defendants then sought to dismiss all the charges on the ground that the government's action presented a realistic likelihood of prosecutorial vindictiveness. On appeal, the court held that an examination of the totality of the circumstances compelled a finding that the government's explanation for the reindictment, not questioned by the trial court, was adequate to negate any realistic apprehension that vindictiveness motivated the increase in charges.</SPAN></P>

The board concluded that the attorney had not established a sufficient basis for granting the motion, but it offered him an opportunity to enlarge the record if he voluntarily would agree to refrain from the practice of law until his disciplinary proceeding had been terminated. He refused, and on appeal he argued that the board had denied him due process. The court agreed with the board's recommendation of disbarment because the board had afforded the attorney due process in that the procedures suggested by the board were entirely consistent with the public's interest in protection against possible harm from the attorney's practice of law and would have remedied any prejudice he may have suffered because of his alleged mental impairment before the hearing committee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Government sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia that granted defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment, which charged defendant with rape, rape while armed, and assault with intent to kill while armed. The trial court held that the offenses were noncapital and barred by the five year period of limitation, codified at 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3282.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Government's appeal presented two issues. The first issue was whether the offenses of armed rape and armed assault with intent to kill were subject to 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3281, 3282. The second issue was whether rape was a capital offense subject to no limitation period pursuant to &sect; 3281, rather than the five-year limitation period of &sect; 3282. The court held that &sect;&sect; 3281, 3282 applied because pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 49-301 (1973), Congress' general laws were applicable to the District of Columbia unless those laws were &quot;locally inapplicable&quot; or inconsistent with some other provision of the District of Columbia Code. The court rejected the Government's argument that a capital offense was determined by the &quot;nature of the offense&quot; rather than the maximum punishment statutorily authorized. The court determined that by enacting the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 473, Congress had expressly changed the maximum prescribed penalty for rape from death to life imprisonment. Congress was presumed to have been aware of existing statutes. Therefore, the court concluded that rape was a non-capital offense subject to U.S.C.S. &sect; 3282.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape and the trial court suspended execution of his sentence and placed him on strictly supervised probation. The trial court revoked the probation after defendant voluntarily appeared in court, requesting more intensive psychotherapy than the outpatient care he was receiving as an express condition of probation. Defendant asserted that the trial court's action deprived him of due process and was an abuse of discretion, as there was no allegation or proof that he had violated the terms of his probation. Although the probation officer made no claim that defendant had violated his probation, the trial court, at the request of the prosecutor, incarcerated him. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding that the maintenance or achievement of a particular level of mental stability was not an implied condition of the probation.

The court found that while the government was wrong in its position that a person could be convicted of unlawful entry merely for refusal to depart, the government introduced ample evidence that defendants' presence on the White House lawn was unauthorized. There was extensive testimony that the tourist line was separated from the lawn by a chain, and a photograph was introduced into evidence which showed the tourist roadway, the separating chain, and the lawn beyond. In view of the dual public and private nature of the White House and the legitimate security interest in maintaining control over the grounds, restriction of public access to portions of the lawn was not an unreasonable restraint of defendants' First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether, under the Home Rule Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-146(a) (1979), the city council had authority to respond to &quot;emergency circumstances&quot; by adopting successive, identical 90-day acts addressed to the same emergency, without a second reading or congressional review. Alleging that the city council lacked such authority, the nonprofit housing corporation brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the city council challenging the validity of three series of emergency acts imposing moratoriums on conversion of rental property to condominium and cooperative units, and regulating the sale of converted units. The trial court ruled for the nonprofit housing corporation and enjoined enforcement of the act then in effect. On appeal, the court concluded that Congress intended the city council's emergency power to be an exception to the fundamental legislative process but that it was not an alternative to be used repeatedly. The court held that enacted legislation in response to an emergency should be effective for no more than ninety days and that the city council had no authority to pass another identical emergency act in response to the same emergency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought licensure as a life insurance solicitor. On his application, he disclosed that he had been convicted of petit larceny and receiving stolen property. At a hearing to evaluate the application, he presented evidence of his rehabilitation. After the superintendent denied the application, the applicant appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that a rational relationship existed between the denial of an insurance solicitor's license to a convicted felon and the protection of the public from insurance solicitors who were untrustworthy. D.C. Code &sect; 35-426 (1973) explicitly indicated that a felony conviction could be the basis for revocation of a license since it may have demonstrated untrustworthiness. Furthermore, the legislation made no suggestion that an applicant's untrustworthiness would have been assessed any differently when ruling on an original license application than on a suspension or revocation. Therefore, it appeared that a felony conviction could not only be considered as evidence of untrustworthiness in a suspension or revocation proceeding, but also at the time at which the license was originally considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was convicted of criminal contempt for his failure to appear in three court-appointed cases and for failure to pay the fine imposed for the initial conviction. The attorney sought review of the convictions, alleging that: both were obtained in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-705(b) (1973), the second trial was tainted by the judge's bias, the attorney had filed an application for a stay of the initial fine, which was never ruled on by the superior court, and payment of the fine would have mooted his appeal. The court found in favor of the attorney, vacating the initial fine and reversing and remanding the judgment of the second fine. The court held that although the statute did not afford the attorney the right to a jury trial for criminal contempt when the penalty received was only a fine, under the Sixth Amendment, he should have been afforded a jury in both trials, as he was fined in excess of $ 300 and was convicted of serious offenses. The court found that the attorney's second conviction was impermissibly tainted by the judge's bias, stemming from an earlier incident with the attorney, which was pursued by the judge beyond &quot;the four corners of the courtroom.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had custody of the children. The father visited the children regularly for many months, but the children began to object to the visitations. The father agreed not to visit the children until they were mature enough to understand the situation. Both children regarded the stepfather as their real father. The children were under extreme emotional distress as a result of being legally obligated to visit with their father, and there were questions surrounding the father's mental heath and abuse of drugs. The trial court determined that the father's failure to consent to the adoptions was against the children's best interest and granted the stepfather's petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-304 (1973) allowed the trial court to grant the petition without the father's consent if the consent was being withheld against the best interest of the children. There was no evidence that the statute was unconstitutionally applied in this case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the gun was a &quot;dangerous article&quot; within the meaning of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3217 (1973) and, therefore, had to be destroyed. The court affirmed the trial court's order, but rejected the trial court's reasoning. The court declined to decide whether the gun was a &quot;dangerous article&quot; under &sect; 22-3217. Instead, the court found that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1875 was applicable to the facts of the case. The court noted that &sect; 6-1875 was part of the Firearms Control Act of 1975 (Act), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1801 et seq. (1978 Supp.), which barred anyone from receiving, possessing, or having under his or her control any firearm or destructive device unless it was registered. The court held that, although the gun could have been lawfully possessed in the District of Columbia, no application for a registration certificate was made either by the owner or the surrendering party, and, therefore, the gun's possession within the District was unlawful. The court concluded that because the owner brought the gun into the District in violation of the Act, the owner was not entitled to recover possession of the gun after it was surrendered to the police.</SPAN></P>

The board denied the prisoner's application. The prisoner subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging denials of due process surrounding the parole hearing. The trial court dismissed the petition and ordered that it be treated as a motion for injunctive relief. Following the hearing, the trial court summarily denied the motion. Later, a second hearing was held on the prisoner's parole application. Nevertheless, the prisoner sought review of the denial of his motion. The court affirmed, holding that the action was barred by the case or controversy doctrine. The court found that a decision regarding the constitutionality of the board's practices and procedures would have constituted an advisory opinion under the circumstances. Although the District of Columbia courts were created under Article I of the Constitution, they were still bound by the Article III case or controversy doctrine, the court said. In this case, the court found it unlikely that the prisoner, who had been transferred to a federal prison, would have come before the board again.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counts in the indictments arose from the invasion of three different sites within the District, the taking of more than 130 hostages, the murder of one man, the wounding of numerous others, the holding of the hostages at gunpoint for nearly 39 hours, and repeated threats to execute the hostages by beheading. Defendants were convicted by a jury of various counts for conspiracy, kidnapping, and assault.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged with a criminal offense. At a hearing before the family division, the juvenile's attorney indicated that he would rely on the insanity defense, and asked the family division to rule on the constitutionality of D.C.

The juvenile appealed, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 16-2315(d). The court affirmed and held the statute constitutional. The court noted that, while every child involved in a delinquency proceeding had the right to due process and equal protection of law, juveniles were not entitled to every due process right available to criminal defendants. The question, the court said, was whether the insanity defense served some function essential to fundamental fairness that could not have been performed adequately by other procedures in the juvenile system. The court held that it did not because the statutes and rules regulating juvenile delinquency proceedings provided an adequate means of ensuring that any mentally ill child received care and treatment similar to that provided to mentally ill criminal defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court (District of Columbia), which convicted him, upon a jury verdict, of unlawful solicitation of money from an indigent client whom he had been appointed to represent under the District of Columbia Criminal Justice Act (Act), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-2601 et seq. (Supp. 1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of violating D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-2606(b) (Supp. 1978). Defendant sought reversal of his conviction on three grounds: (1) the unconstitutionality of the penal provisions of the Act; (2) improper cross-examination of defendant by means of his testimony before a grand jury regarding a prior solicitation incident; and (3) the erroneous inclusion of statutory background on the Act in the trial court's final charge to the jury. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-2606(b) (Supp. 1978) put a reasonable person on notice that certain conduct was deemed criminal, such as the solicitation or acceptance of a fee by a court-appointed attorney from his indigent client. Additionally, the solicitation incident was probative of intent, thus, was properly admissible because it involved an offense similar in kind and reasonably close in time to the offense charged. Finally, the trial court's discussion before the jury of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-2606(a) (Supp. 1978) was far from superfluous background material and was an accurate statement of the law.</SPAN></P>

The victim lapsed into a coma, and when her condition did not improve, the physician's involved in the case, upon agreement with the victim's family, discontinued all &quot;heroic measures.&quot; The first defendant contended that the trial court erred in its instructions because it failed to instruct the jury that if the doctor's termination of the victim's life support system constituted willful or intentional malpractice, then the jury could find defendant not guilty and that if the jury found that the victim would have lived for more than a year and a day, but for the termination of life support, they could find defendant not guilty. The court rejected the first defendant's contentions, holding that there was no evidentiary basis for the first instruction and that the year and a day rule was inapplicable because the victim died within a year. The court rejected the second defendant's arguments that his confession was unconstitutionally elicited and that termination of life support constituted an intervening cause, insulating him from liability.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction by a jury in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia for second degree murder under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2403 and robbery under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 33-2901. The trial court granted defendant's motion for a bifurcated trial but refused to impanel separate juries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion for separate jury trials on the merit and responsibility issues. Defense counsel asserted that the proffered testimony concerning insanity was highly relevant to that issue but not to a defense on the merits, and that to introduce it during the guilt phase would severely prejudice the jury because of the inflammatory character of the evidence. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction. By refusing to conduct a separate voir dire at the beginning of the insanity phase, the trial court prejudiced defendant by placing counsel in a &quot;catch-22&quot; position. He could probe the jurors about their attitudes toward insanity prior to trial on the merits and incur virtually certain severe prejudice to his defense on the merits by indicating to the jurors that an additional, inconsistent defense was yet to come. His other option was to forego voir dire on this issue entirely and be unable to assure that impaneled jurors were not biased with respect to the insanity defense. The court also held that because of defendant's mental illness, he was unable to voluntarily waive his rights and that his statements to police should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a rent regulation was declared invalid, the landlord filed an application seeking to increase the rent on the tenant's apartment. The petition was granted but the tenant vacated the apartment. The landlord brought an action against the tenant for back rent owed, which the trial court denied. The trial court also ordered the landlord to return the tenant's couch. On appeal, the court held that it had to determine how the existence of the apparently valid regulation prior to its invalidation for the period before that decision affected the rights and obligations of the parties. The court held that the once-popular &quot;void ad initio&quot; rule had been declared invalid. The applicable test was one of reasonableness and good faith to determine the consequences that flowed from conduct undertaken pursuant to the invalid act. The court found that the landlord was entitled under his valid lease agreement to collect the rent that was due. The court concluded that the landlord did not act unreasonably when he did not allow the tenant's brother to collect her items from her apartment and therefore held the trial court committed error when it ordered the landlord to pay for the couch's return.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners contended that the variance hearing notice was defective; that the BZA misapplied the statutory standard, and that its findings of fact were erroneous and deficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer sought to purchase one of two adjacent lots from owner. However, because the lot was too small to comply with the residential neighborhood's zoning requirements, the sale was contingent on obtaining a variance that allowed the buyer to build a home on the lot. The neighbors filed an action to review the BZA's decision to grant the variance. On appeal, the court affirmed because there was substantial evidence to support the BZA's findings and the BZA's conclusions flowed rationally from those findings. There was evidence that the lot had been recorded before the current zoning regulations went into effect. If the variance were not allowed, the lot could not be used for anything and the lot owner would be deprived on any beneficial use of the lot. The court found that the BZA properly applied D.C. Code &sect; 5-420(3) (1973) and D.C. Zoning Regs. art. 82, &sect; 8207.11 when it granted the variance on these facts because the buyer proved peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties caused by the minimum lot size requirement and the BZA properly concluded that the minimum lot area restrictions were more than unnecessarily burdensome. Thus, the variance was justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, assault on a police officer while armed, and petit larceny. Defendant contended that, among other things, the trial court erred in incorporating a notion of reciprocity in its administration of the discovery process and in allowing the prosecution to cross-examine him concerning a prior offense. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court erred in finding that defendant's right to documents under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3500, was contingent on his surrender of a report by a defense investigator which purported to contain statements by several prospective government witnesses and in refusing to compel production as long as defendant resisted reciprocal discovery. The trial court had no authority to order defense counsel to surrender to the government evidence gathered by one of its investigators. Although a witness's grand jury testimony was producible under the Jencks Act and was improperly withheld from defendant, such error was harmless. The case against defendant was strong, and even if the trial testimony of the witness had been excluded, the jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant was guilty of the crimes charged.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the police department's decision. The court held that: (1) the determination not to grandfather weapons with greater fire power had a sufficient rational basis to withstand an equal protection attack where such weapons were more dangerous and threatened the security of police officers who carried six-shot revolvers; (2) the weapons owners lacked standing to challenge the statute's &quot;designed to shoot&quot; test as being vague or overbroad where their weapons were disqualified under the &quot;readily converted to shoot&quot; test; and (3) where the registration requirement was an exercise of the police power and not of eminent domain it did not require compensation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended on appeal that the District of Columbia Bail Reform Act was unconstitutional, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. The court affirmed the judgment against defendant. The court found that the Act was constitutionally sound because it did not shift the burden to defendant to disprove the presumed existence of an element of a crime. Based on a showing of notice of the appearance date and failure to appear, the Act merely created a permissible inference of the element of willfulness that a trier of fact was not required to accept. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support a verdict of guilty and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.</SPAN></P>

After a foreclosure, the landlord eventually acquired the property. The tenant still owed on his note. The landlord noticed the tenant to vacate the property, and timely filed an action to evict him. The tenant entered a plea of title pursuant to D.C. Super. Ct. R. P. Landlord and Tenant Branch 5(C). The lower court held a hearing and granted the landlord's motion for judgment for possession because the tenant failed to comply with the procedural matters, and presented no meritorious arguments on various allegations and motions. The court affirmed and commented on only two issues. The court found that the primary transaction was between private parties in which the government agency's participation was minimal at best. That fact presented no foundation upon which to build a constitutional claim. It found that he was not a tenant at will as defined in the D.C. Rental Accommodations Act of 1975, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 45-822 et seq. (Supp. 1978). As a tenant by possession rather than by contractual relationship with the landlord, he was not entitled to statutory protection.</SPAN></P>

Following a competency examination yielding a finding of mental illness, he was arraigned and ordered to a hospital for mental observation pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(a) (1973). The trial judge entered a judgment of not guilty by reason of insanity. Thereafter, defendant was recommitted and was afforded his D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(d)(2) (1973) &quot;release hearing,&quot; at which the trial court determined that he was mentally ill and likely to be dangerous to himself or others in the reasonable future. The trial court accordingly continued his commitment indefinitely. Defendant filed a motion in this court for summary reversal. The court denied defendant's motion and affirmed the indefinite commitment. The court held that, on the assumption that the commitment was lawful, there was no constitutional requirement that defendant be released or civilly committed at the end of the maximum imprisonment period because that period bore no relationship to the unchallenged basis for defendant's hospital confinement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, individuals and organizations allegedly adversely affected by the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 (FCRA), D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1801 et seq. (1978 Supp.) (objectors), challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in favor of appellees, the District of Columbia, its mayor, and its chief of police (proponents), in the objectors' action seeking to declare the FCRA invalid and to enjoin its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objectors claimed that the FCRA was an unauthorized exercise of the legislative powers of the District of Columbia Council (council) and that it violated the United States Constitution. The trial court granted the proponents' order for summary judgment, holding that the enactment of the FCRA was a valid exercise of the council's congressionally delegated legislative power and rejecting all but one of the objectors' constitutional attacks. After affirming the trial court's jurisdiction, the court also affirmed that the newly elected council was authorized to enact legislation, finding that the validity of the FCRA could be sustained under the council's power set forth in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-144(a), notwithstanding the limitation contained in D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-147(a)(9). It was clear that legislative power transferred from the predecessor council to the new council necessarily included the function of enacting police regulations pursuant to D.C. Code &sect; 1-226 (1973) and gun control measures pursuant to D.C. Code &sect; 1-227 (1973). Further, the court found no merit in the constitutional challenges, and thus reversed the trial court's severing of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1811(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the proponents and denial of declaratory and injunctive relief to the objectors, affirming the trial court's finding that the FCRA was a valid exercise of the council's congressionally-delegated legislative power. The court also found all the provisions of the FCRA constitutional and thus reversed the trial court's severing of one section of the FCRA on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the police lawfully possessed the motorcycle because defendant consented to the taking of his motorcycle when he indicated that he did not want his motorcycle left on the road. The court further held that the subsequent inventory search was pursuant to standard police procedures, which were designed to protect defendant's property and the police officer's safety and potential claims of stolen or lost property. The court then held that the trial court's sentence, which was imposed under the Federal Probation Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3651, was improper because the Act did not apply.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before his transfer to the mental hospital under local statute,&nbsp;D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-302 (1973), the inmate had accumulated &quot;good time&quot; credits toward an early release date. While incarcerated in the hospital, his &quot;short-term release date&quot; had passed. On appeal, the government argued that the trial court erred in granting the writ for habeas corpus because &sect; 24-302 should have been interpreted like the federal transfer statute,&nbsp;18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4241, which held &quot;good time&quot; credits in abeyance until a prisoner had recovered from the mental illness or until his maximum sentence expired. The court agreed and reversed the decision. In doing so, the court construed and harmonized the federal and District of Columbia statutes dealing with good time allowances and the transfer of mentally ill prisoners. The court held that the proper interpretation of the D.C. Code provision regarding the transfer of prison inmates to mental hospitals, which was silent on the issue of good time credits, should have followed the federal policy on the operation of such credits notwithstanding the fact that the inmate was transferred pursuant to local law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer made a special appearance in the employee's action solely to assert its immunity from suit pursuant to the International Organizations Immunities Act of 1945 (Act), 22 U.S.C.S. &sect; 288 (Supp. IV). The trial court agreed that the employer had immunity. On appeal, the employee alleged that under the Act, the President could condition or revoke immunity, but not grant it. The employee claimed that his action arose before immunization was granted. The employee contended that the employer was not immune from his action because the employer enjoyed less protective immunity than foreign governments. The court found that the President did not have authority to grant immunity. However, the court indicated that the employer was not granted immunity, but rather was designated as an international organization under the Act, which entitled the employer to immunity. The court found that the date the complaint was filed, not the date the cause of action arose, was material to the question of immunity, so the employer was entitled to immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed orders from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted him on a jury's verdict of conspiracy to operate a lottery and operating a lottery, D.C. Code &sect; 22-1501 (1973), possession of numbers slips, D.C. Code &sect; 22-1502 (1973), maintaining a premises for gambling purposes, D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions resulted primarily from evidence gathered through the use of a pen register and subsequent wiretap of his telephone. On appeal, defendant asserted that there was insufficient probable cause to support the trial court's order authorizing the attachment of the pen register to his telephone. Pen registers were not subject to the more stringent requirements needed to authorize a wiretap. Based on the testimony of an informant who had given the police information for four years, surveillance conducted at the premises, defendant and his co-conspirator's prior gambling convictions, and the circumstances of the telephone listing, the court affirmed that there was probable cause for the issuance of the pen register. The court rejected defendant's contention that the prosecution of gambling offenses was discriminatory because defendant failed to allege a difference in treatment based on a constitutionally suspect standard. The trial court had not erred in quashing defendant's subpoenas to various government officials, sought for the purpose of having them testify about lotteries in general. The officials had no personal knowledge of defendant's actions or case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's gambling offense convictions, holding that the issuance of an order for a pen register, which was used to obtain a wiretap, was supported by probable cause, that defendant's prosecution was not based on an unconstitutional bias, and that the trial court had not erred by quashing defendant's subpoenas to officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An alternate juror was approached by a man who stated that she had &quot;better not find him guilty,&quot; apparently referring to a defendant. The alternate juror informed one other juror, who mentioned the comment obliquely to other jurors when explaining why the alternate juror was no longer present. The trial court questioned each juror individually, without revealing the threat, and each juror stated emphatically that they could continue to serve without bias. The court on appeal affirmed the convictions, finding that the presumption of prejudice to the two defendants raising the issue was overcome by the voir dire conducted. The court also noted that no inadmissible evidence had been presented to the jury by the unknown man. Regarding other issues, the court held that an aider and abettor under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-105 (1973) could be guilty of felony murder under &sect; 22-2401 without any proof of intent to kill. The court also held that robbery did not merge into felony murder because the purposes behind the two statutes were distinct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three weeks prior to his trial, defendant's appointed counsel asserted defendant's right to the disclosure of information, which counsel maintained was material to preparing her defense. The trial court took offense at counsel's argument, refused to let counsel explain her position fully, and ordered that she be removed from the case. The trial court subsequently refused defendant's request that counsel be reinstated. After defendant was convicted, he appealed and asserted that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated when his appointed attorney was removed without just cause, over his objection. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction. The court noted that a vigorous bar was essential to fairness and that the discovery claim had not been frivolously made. It held that once defendant's counsel had been appointed, the trial court had no right to remove her under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-2603 (1977 Supp.) unless necessary in &quot;the interest of justice.&quot; The court held that defendant did not have to show prejudice arising from the unwarranted removal of his counsel because the Sixth Amendment violation constituted reversible error, even if no prejudice were shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord was not the owner of the house that the tenant rented but instead was a sublessor. A co-owner, had testified that she rented the house to the landlord pursuant to a five-year lease. The terms of that lease provided that the landlord was to make repairs to the house before subleasing it. The tenant ceased paying rent, and the landlord brought actions against the tenant for the unpaid rent and for possession of the property. These actions were consolidated. The tenant raised defenses and counterclaims based upon a breach of the warranty of habitability, contending that because of the unsafe and unsanitary conditions in the house the lease should be declared void. She also asserted that the amount of rent claimed was in excess of that allowed by the District of Columbia's rent control legislation. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the landlord. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that because the trial court made no general finding of constitutional infirmity as to the rent control legislation, it was error for the trial court to declare the legislation unconstitutional as applied to the landlord.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consolidated appeals grew out of an attempted bank robbery, which resulted in the killing of a policewoman. Defendant and their codefendants set out to commit a bank robbery that they had planned over a period of several days. Defendant A was approaching the bank when police sergeants A and B observed the leader of the group carrying a satchel from which protruded a suspicious object wrapped in a towel. Sergeant B asked the leader what was in the bag. The leader approached the police car, removed a shotgun from the bag, and threatened sergeant B. At that time, defendant B was proceeding toward the bank, turning back only when he heard police sirens and concluded that something had gone wrong. The policewoman followed defendant A into an underground garage. Defendant A pulled a gun and fired at her. She was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Defendant A and B contended that they and their colleagues never crossed the line from preparation to attempt. The court found no error in the submission of that issue to the jury. A reasonable jury could find that defendants had gone beyond mere preparation and were within dangerous proximity of the criminal end sought to be attained.</SPAN></P>

The licensing commission never adopted the proposed policy requiring that all treatments be administered under direct supervision of a licensed physician and that the physician must be physically present throughout the treatment. It was of no legal consequence that the physician was put on notice of the policy statement because the statements were never formally or informally adopted and hence had no legal effect.

The board affirmed the denial and the parolee sought review. The board challenged the court's jurisdiction, arguing that the court had jurisdiction only over contested actions, and that the board's action on the denial was not a contested action because the regulations required a denial of a license. The court rejected this argument and held that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal on its merits. The court affirmed the board's denial, rejecting the parolee's equal protection challenges. The court held that a licensing provision aimed at protecting the public could set standards relating to competency, and that a provision barring felons from operating taxicabs was rationally related to the legitimate objective of securing safe public transportation. The court rejected the parolee's argument that the regulation did not exclude all ex-offers, holding that a classification need not be perfect or result in precise equality so long as the classification had a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act, under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 45-1644(a)(3)(A), imposed a rent ceiling computed according to a specified formula that permitted a landlord to charge a tenant a rate of return of no greater than eight percent. The landlords contended that, absent wartime conditions, imposition by the city council of controls on rent charged by landlords was constitutionally unwarranted and that the Act was not a valid exercise of the police power because no such emergency existed. To the contrary, the landlords viewed the Act as an effort to apportion the tenant's increased living expenses with his landlord. The court affirmed the denial of the landlords' motion to enjoin the enforcement of the Act. The court found that the city council had determined that there was a continuing housing crisis and that a rent control program was necessary to stabilize rents over an extended period of time in order to alleviate the emergency. Accordingly, the court was unable to say that the Act was an unwarranted, and hence invalid, exercise of police power or was an attempt to subsidize tenants at the expense of landlords.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company filed a petition to set aside power rates, which were prescribed by the commission. The court vacated the commission's decision and remanded the case. The court held that the commission arbitrarily and unreasonably set the utility company's rate base at a level insufficient to allow the utility company a reasonable opportunity to earn the rate of return that the commission itself found to be just and necessary. The court found that the commission had ignored the utility company's most recent historical data on record and refused to take proper cognizance of known and relevant changes of the record. The court also found that the rates imposed by the commission disadvantaged both the investor and consumer interests and denied the utility company its constitutionally guaranteed opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on its investment. The court ruled that the commission's exclusion of the most recent data from consideration and evaluation was arbitrary as a matter of law. The court reasoned that in an attempt to keep rates down, the Commission impermissibly ignored the consumers' and the investors' concerns with the financial stability of the utility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney, who was an associate in a Washington law firm, worked exclusively on labor-management matters. The attorney was involved in arbitration proceedings, in which a member of the law firm representing the employer was acting as the arbitrator. A petition instituting disciplinary proceedings was later filed against the attorney, alleging that he had violated D.C. Bar R. &sect; 1-102(A)(5). The Board recommended that the attorney receive a one-month suspension from the practice of law. On appeal, the court adopted the Board's recommendation and ordered that the attorney be suspended from the practice of law for one month. Because the attorney's action occurred prior to the adoption of the Code of Professional Responsibility, he was subject to the broad standard, which existed at the time under the court's &quot;inherent disciplinary powers.&quot; The court found that the sham arbitration misled one party totally, and that the damage to the administration of justice was far-reaching. The attorney was charged not only for the failure to make known his relationship with the arbitrator to the representative of the union before or during the arbitration, but also after the arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a previous case before a different trial judge, two defendants were tried for first-degree murder after their original convictions were reversed by an appellate tribunal.

Jurors later learned that police officers believed that they had convicted the wrong man. Here, the jurors were selected from the same pool and one of the jurors sworn, had served on the previous jury. Prior to opening arguments, the trial judge determined that the jury had been tainted and dismissed the indictment against defendant. On appeal, the court held that the discharge of the jury constituted a mistrial, but that the proper remedy for a trial before a presumably tainted jury was a new trial before an impartial jury. The court reversed, and held that under these circumstances a retrial was not barred by double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. With full knowledge that possession of the pistol was illegal, defendant retained it and carried it, loaded, on the street. Under the circumstances, the court did not deem his claim properly cognizable as an excuse under the policy of &sect; 22-3204. Under the facts tendered in his defense, defendant was not entitled as a matter of law to his requested instruction on innocent possession. The court did not reach the trial court's holding that a Terry frisk was justified. The circumstance gave police officers (officers) probable cause to arrest and search defendant. The seizure of the pistol was proper. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was properly denied. The officers acted on eyewitness information within a few moments of the offense. Enough particularized information existed for the trial judge to have found probable cause to justify an arrest. The fact that the victims did not ultimately identify the apprehended individuals as the perpetrators was irrelevant to the question of a valid arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government, pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-104(c) (1973), sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia that granted defendant's motion and dismissed the indictment against him. The indictment charged defendant with threatening to injure the person and property of the complainant in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2307 (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the indictment should be dismissed because it was ambiguous and did not contain sufficient detail. The court reversed the order dismissing the indictment. Defendant claimed that the indictment was ambiguous because it accused him of violating D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2307 (1973), a felony, when the same conduct was also a violation of D. C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-507 (1973), a misdemeanor. The court concluded that the prosecutor had the option of choosing under which statute to prosecute a defendant and that a defendant did not have a constitutional right to elect the applicable statute. The court concluded that D. C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2307 (1973) did not suffer from vagueness, ambiguity, or constitutional infirmity on due process/equal protection grounds merely because it proscribed the same conduct as D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-507 (1973). The court explained that an indictment was required to inform the accused of the charge against him by listing the elements of the offense charged and to be sufficiently specific to protect the accused against double jeopardy. The court found that the indictment in this case met those criteria.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order dismissing the indictment and remanded the case with directions to reinstate the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The court found nothing offensive to constitutional mandates in the standard that focused on the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; rather than solely on the status or abilities of the natural parent. The court held that the &quot;best interests of the child standard&quot; was not vague because in the context of placing the child for adoption, no more precision appeared possible and no more was constitutionally required. The court also held that parental consent for adoption had to be shown to have been withheld contrary to the child's best interests by &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence, so that the trial court did not err in using a &quot;substantial preponderance&quot; of the evidence standard because the standards were substantially identical.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and was charged with unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. At his presentment, he was ordered to appear in a lineup. The order specified that he was not to change his facial or bodily appearance prior to the lineup. Defendant later appeared at the lineup with a shaven head. At that hearing, the arresting officer identified defendant, and testified that defendant had a two-inch bush hairstyle at the time of his arrest. Defendant testified that he had his hair cut once a month, and that the particular cut fulfilled his desire to have his hair &quot;cut close.&quot; In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the court held that a petty contempt, that was, one for which the penalty imposed either did not exceed six months, or a longer penalty had not been expressly authorized by statute, could have been tried without a jury. The applicable standard in a criminal contempt case was that guilt had to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant knew he had been ordered not to change his appearance, but he nevertheless had. Defendant failed to show any exigent circumstances, which might have excused his failure to obtain court permission for his change in appearance.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer argued that &sect; 47-1571a was unconstitutional as construed to tax an out of state business on dividends received from a subsidiary that earned 97 percent of its premiums from non-district business. The court noted that as a general rule state franchise taxes levied upon corporations doing business in several states could not be sustained unless limited to some formula restricted to corporate activity within the taxing state. The court reversed the denial of the refund, remanding the matter to the trial court for a finding of whether the taxpayer was doing business in the district. The court held that by construing &sect; 47-1571a to embrace a dividend not apportioned to its derivation from local business or fairly relating to services provided by the district, the trial court had failed to take into account the constitutional limitations of the corporate franchise act.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 25-118, which prohibited a licensee from using premises for any unlawful, and D.C. Code &sect; 22-2001(a)(1)(B), which forbade the presentation or any obscene, indecent, or filthy play, dance, motion picture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated a restaurant with a nightclub on the building's lower level, where female &quot;go-go&quot; dancers performed. Two undercover police officers went to the bar on assignment and arrested the club manager and a dancer after the officers observed the dancer take off her undergarments, wrap herself around, and kiss, several patrons. The prosecutor decided not to prosecute the arrestees for presenting or participating in an obscene performance in violation of &sect; 22-2001(a)(1)(B). After hearing, the Board found that the manager had adopted a method of operation which encouraged obscene performances in violation of &sect; 22-2001(a)(1)(B). On appeal, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the Board's finding because there was no evidence that the manager had adopted a continuous course of conduct, which encouraged the performance given by the dancer on the night of the officers' visit. The court further determined that the dance itself was not the kind of performance forbidden under &sect; 22-2001(a)(1)(B) because the dancer did nothing &quot;patently offensive&quot; to community standards in the District of Columbia, which had a history of allowing burlesque entertainment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendant's motion to exclude in-court identification testimony and held that although the second police detention of defendant was defective for lack of probable cause, the victims' ability to identify defendant was unaffected by police conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three women were robbed at gunpoint in a public restroom. Three days later, officers observed defendant, who matched the description they obtained from the victims, in the vicinity of the robberies. After the officers learned that defendant was 16, he was taken into custody as a suspected truant, photographed, interviewed, and released. The following day, the victims each identified defendant from an array of eight mug shots and one victim also identified defendant at a lineup. Defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress all identification testimony on the ground that his detention for truancy had been a pretext to seek evidence for the robbery investigation, and that the identification testimony, as a product of his illegal detention, was inadmissible. The appellate court held that accepting the trial court's finding that defendant's detention constituted an arrest without probable cause, the question was whether in-court identification testimony by the victims was evidence that resulted from an impermissible exploitation of that arrest. The court concluded that the incident reflected good faith misjudgment by the officers that did not warrant exclusion of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court vacated the judgments of conviction and remanded for a hearing on defendant's responsibility for the offenses. The court reasoned that there was ample, relevant evidence to require the submission of the insanity issue to the jury. Further, defendant had introduced evidence of insanity sufficient to constitute a prima facie case. Two medical experts testified that defendant suffered from an advanced case of alcoholism, that defendant had brain damage, and that the homicide was the result of a mental disease or defect affecting defendant's capacity to know right from wrong and impair his behavior controls. With respect to the felony murder conviction, the court ruled that something more than a small penknife was required to meet the &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; provision of the felony murder statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient had a history of mental illness and was hospitalized on several occasions. On one occasion, he was released after a trial wherein the jury found that he was not a danger to himself or others. Two months later, he was admitted to the mental hospital on an involuntary emergency basis. The superintendent applied for judicial commitment under the Act and another jury trial was held under D.C. Code &sect; 21-545. In opening statements, the patient's attorney pointed out that only a short time before another jury had determined that the patient was not a danger. Subsequently, a verdict was returned that, although mentally ill, the patient was not likely to injure himself or others. The superior court ordered him released but stayed the order upon the superintendent's appeal. The appellate court first ruled that, as an aggrieved party, the superintendent had a right of appeal under D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was sold to satisfy delinquent 1971 real estate taxes. The former owners argued that the notification procedure followed by the state concerning the tax sale and the expiration of the redemption period violated due process even though the statutory requirements were satisfied. On 11 prior occasions, the former owners paid the taxes due just as the two-year redemption period was about to expire. Pursuant to statute, the city accelerated the date of tax sales from January to October, which changed the expiration date for the redemption period. When the former owners attempted to redeem in January of 1974, they were told that the two-year redemption period ended in October 1973. The court held that the procedures employed by the city were reasonably calculated to notify the former owners of the actions taken against their property and afforded them adequate opportunity to protect their interests. The notices which were provided satisfied constitutional requirements. The court held that the change in sales date did not rise to the level of due process deprivation.</SPAN></P>

The housing authority denied the applicant's admission to the program. On appeal, the court affirmed the housing authority's decision. In view of the circumstances around which the Brooke Amendment was passed and its legislative history, the court concluded that it was intended to apply only to conventional public housing rental projects where maintenance and operating costs were federally subsidized. In the court's view, the 22.5 percent minimum income requirement, which was set by the housing authority, did not violate the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1401 et seq., or any of the concepts embodied therein. The court found as a matter of law that the housing authority's minimum income requirement was valid and did not violate the HUD regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator executed a will on October 13, 1972 in which she left two-thirds of her residuary estate to two churches. She died November 2, 1972. The testator had executed previous wills where both churches had received bequests. Although there was no evidence that the churches made any attempts to influence the bequests, the executor of the estate brought an action to seek instructions on distributions, and the heirs and next of kin of the testator joined the action to challenge the churches' interest. The trial court ruled that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 18-302 (1973) was unconstitutional and that both the testator's estate and all future estate be administered without regard to &sect; 18-302. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the statute was invalid under equal protection and due process principals. The court noted that &sect; 18-302's prohibition with regard to only religious classifications was irrational when the purpose of the law was to protect a testator from undue influences close to her death. The court noted that similar situated legatees, such as non-religious charitable or educational organizations, were arbitrarily given better treatment under the law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the statute violated constitutional equal protection guarantees both on its face and as applied. Specifically, defendant contended that the prohibition of sodomitic acts had a disproportionate and disparate impact on homosexuals, since it deprived this discrete and insular minority of one of its primary avenues of sexual gratification. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the statute, by its very terms, proscribed specific conduct and did not single out any particular group of persons. The statute applied to acts between men, between women, and between a man and a woman. Similarly, the statute drew no distinction between sodomitic acts committed by homosexuals, heterosexuals, or bisexuals. In view of its universal applicability, the court concluded that the statute was neutral on its face and was a reasonable exercise of the right of the legislature to maintain a decent society.

Days later, another officer went to the store with an arrest warrant and search warrant for the premises. The officer arrested the manager and seized four more copies. Defendants were tried jointly. Both sides contested the social value and literary merit. The trial court deferred judgment until the U.S. Supreme Court decided Miller v. California after which the trial court heard additional argument as to the effect on cases before it. On appeal, the court held that suspending final judgment pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision and then applying both the Miller and pre-Miller obscenity tests was proper. The governing statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face under a second Miller guideline on the ground that it did not specifically define sexual conduct, the depiction or description of which was proscribed. It was not unconstitutional or ex post facto to retroactively apply the Miller standards to pre-Miller conduct of defendants as it gave them the benefit of constitutional principles.

The court did adopt a variation of the ALI standard for prospective application of the District of Columbia (D.C.) Court system. The court also stated that the D.C. courts were not bound by the concept of diminished responsibility and that adoption of the principle of &quot;diminished capacity&quot; was not warranted. Further, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-301(j), which required defendant to establish his defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, was not violative of due process or equal protection.

The appellate court held that the statute was not vague, because on its face, it was aimed at certain limited conduct, trespassing upon property without a legal right to do so, that was constitutionally subject to restraint. The court also ruled that the statute did not unduly interfere with defendant's rights of expression as secured by the First Amendment. According to the court, the fundamental regard for First Amendment liberties was not diminished by reasonable regulations, unrelated to the content of the message, concerning the time, place, and manner of the exercise of those liberties.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the manager of an adult bookstore and amusement arcade where four films that were displayed by coin-operated projectors were seized as part of a search by warrant. At trial on the charges under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2001(a)(1)(B) and (E), both parties presented evidence as to whether the films were obscene. After a jury returned a guilty verdict on all four counts, the trial court entered a judgment of conviction. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that consistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the District of Columbia could regulate obscene material as long as the law conformed with the First Amendment standards specified by it. The court noted that the Supreme Court had ruled that laws forbidding works that when taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest in sex, which portrayed sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and did not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value were constitutional. Section 22-2001(a)(1)(B) and (E) was constitutional as long as convictions, such as defendants, followed the standards set by the Supreme Court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed an action against appellants to obtain partial refunds of the taxes that they had paid in the 1973 fiscal year on all single-family residential properties they owned in the District of Columbia which were assessed at 60 percent estimated market value. The trial court held that the taxpayers were entitled to the relief sought, and appellants sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court judgment and held that the taxpayers were not entitled to refunds either under the applicable statutes or by virtue of equitable principles. To support its determination, the court noted that the taxpayers had failed to pursue the applicable statutory remedy outlined in D.C. Code &sect; 47-709 (1973). Further, the court emphasized that equity counseled against the refund of the taxes paid, because under circumstances the adverse impact of refunds on the entire citizenry of the municipality outweighed the economic interest of the taxpayers who had paid the taxes at issue. After a balancing of all interests in this case, the court, therefore, concluded that the public interest would be disserved by a grant of the refunds sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A primary presidential election was held to determine a party candidate and to vote for the delegates to the party national convention. The ballot design provided that the voters could only have voted for delegates that were committed to a single candidate. A large portion of the ballots were invalidated by the Board when the voters selected the delegates of a particular candidate, but failed to mark the box next to the candidate's name. The Board refused to count those ballots as indications of presidential preference. The court set aside the election results and required the Board to count the disputed ballots. The court had jurisdiction pursuant to &sect; 1111(b) to review the Board's results. Even though the legislature was not allowed to select delegates to a national political convention, it had the right to prescribe the procedures that were to have been followed in the selection of the delegates. The court's review of the Board's results did not interfere with the party's rules on delegate selection, but merely ascertained whether the Board's results were accurate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal, the court held that trial court could terminate parental rights under Rule 18(c). Petitioners sought a determination as to the effect of the court's ruling on 100 children who previously had parental rights terminated under Rule 18(c) and who were in various stages of the adoption process or who had been adopted. The court denied the petition, holding that its ruling prohibiting the termination of parental rights under Rule 18(c) would have prospective application only and was binding on any case where the judgment had not become final because a retrospective application would result in injustice and hardship on children and parents who had been parties to prior parental rights termination proceedings that were brought under Rule 18(c). Children who already have had parental rights terminated under Rule 18(c) would be protected because jurisdictional challenges to the prior judgments were barred by res judicata. Challenges to the validity of any prior order entered under Rule 18(c) would not be heard where the parties had failed to timely assert their right to appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a judgment in lieu of mandate that gave 90 days to the government to implement the means to afford a reasonably prompt vindication of the cost pass-through right that was an integral part of D.C. Code tit. 45, &sect; 1627(a) after D.C. Reg. 2498 of the District of Columbia Rental Accommodations Act of 1975 was enacted. During the interim period, rent increases were to have been allowed on a general or an individual basis if necessary. The superior court treated the interim requests individually and no significant progress was made during the 90-day period. The court granted the owners' petition for a writ of mandamus because the superior court failed to comply with the court's prior mandate. Pursuant to D.C. Code tit. 45, &sect; 1627(a), the owners were entitled to rent increases for the interim period because neither the expiration of the 90-day period nor the enactment of the new rent control program altered the rights that were earlier vested in the owners. In light of the administrative lethargy under the old rent program, the court utilized its power, pursuant to D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, charity and the District of Columbia (district), sought review of an order of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia that directed that appellee mentally ill child (child) be transferred from a public hospital (hospital) in the district to a hospital in Rhode Island and ordered the charity and the district to bear the costs of that placement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the child was abandoned in Korea, the charity arranged for her adoption by an American family in Illinois. Soon after she arrived, the family discovered that the child was not developing normally and refused to continue with the adoption. The charity assumed custody, but was unable to place the child in a permanent home because of her violent behavior. She was then sent to the district where she was involuntarily committed to the hospital pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 21-541 (1973). The trial court subsequently found that the child was a district resident, that she was mentally ill and a danger to herself, that she had unique treatment needs, could not be adequately cared for at the hospital, and that there were no suitable alternatives for her care other than the Rhode Island hospital. On appeal, the court agreed that the child was a district resident and that the district was liable for her care pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 32-405 (1973). The court held, however, that the child's custody fell to the charity by default and that it could not be held liable for the costs of her treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's order that found the district liable for the child's medical expenses and reversed the portion of the order that found the charity liable for those expenses. The court remanded to the trial court so that the district could propose a program of medical and psychiatric care suitable for the child's treatment during the term of her involuntary commitment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that appellants' failure to pursue their administrative remedy by requesting the Board to grant them exemptions from the disclosure requirements precluded their initiating a judicial action to have the statute declared unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement. The court rejected the argument that being forced to exhaust an administrative remedy was a separate injury amenable to judicial action before the exhaustion requirement was fulfilled because that would only serve to eliminate the &quot;exhaustion doctrine&quot; entirely. Also rejected was the claim that exhausting administrative remedies was futile because the Board had already declined to hold &sect; 1-1182(b) unconstitutional; there would be no claim of injury if appellant's pursuant and obtained the administrative exemptions from compliance.</SPAN></P>

If there was a hardship present, it stemmed from the fact that petitioner contracted to purchase the existing property for $ 66,000 without conditioning the contract upon the securing of a use variance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that sanctions should have been imposed pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3500 when the government was unable to produce a drawing of the crime scene. He also alleged that the release offender statute was unconstitutionally vague, that the trial court erred by imposing the additional sentence without determining his release offender status, and that he was deprived of adequate procedural safeguards at sentencing. The court held that sanctions were not warranted because the drawing did not constitute a statement under the Jencks Act. The release offender statute did not violate due process. Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial on whether he committed an offense while on release because the release offender statute did not create a new and separate crime. The court, however, held that the additional sentence under the release offender statute was erroneous. Defendant did not respond when the trial court asked him if he had been previously convicted. The trial court erred by treating defendant's silence as an admission of fact and not requiring the government to prove that defendant was on release at the time he committed the substantive offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four defendants were charged with sexual solicitation. The first defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional. The second defendant pleaded guilty, which the trial court vacated. The third defendant pleaded guilty and was told by the trial court that it could not accept the plea. The charges against the first three defendants were dismissed on the basis that the methods used to enforce the statute were unconstitutional. The charge against the fourth defendant was dismissed in reliance on prior case law. On appeal, the court agreed with the government's contention that the trial court had erred in dismissing the charges because of what it perceived to have been unfair enforcement practices. The court stated that the statute did not punish the condition of a person, but rather his conduct. The court stated that the statute was applied against defendants' conduct and not their individual status as transsexuals. There was no legitimate issue in the cases with respect to cruel and unusual punishment.

Defendant's request to be treated as a first time offender was rejected on the grounds that he was under investigation by the grand jury on an unrelated matter. Defendant moved to dismiss the information on the grounds the criminal penalties for possession of marijuana violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII. After the motion was denied, defendant was denied first offender treatment. Defendant argued first offender treatment was denied to those defendants who chose to litigate any issues in their cases. The trial court found for defendant. On appeal, the court reversed holding that defendant was not prejudiced by the official policy that no issues be litigated while his application for diversionary treatment was pending because he was not deterred from exercising his right to defend himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia, defendant appealed on the grounds that the statute prohibiting the possession of implements of a crime violated due process. He argued that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-3601 (1973), which allowed a defense based on innocent possession, impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the State to him. The court noted that a defendant was not required to have statutory permission before raising an innocent explanation about why he was in possession of criminal implements. The statute essentially recognized a common law defense: lack of criminal intent. It was not improper to presume that a person who possessed contraband had knowledge of a crime, absent proof from that person that his possession was innocent. Placing the burden of showing innocent possession on a defendant did not shift the burden of proof. The State retained the burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, neither the presumption nor the defense violated due process.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, contrary to the citizens association's contention, the commission was not precluded from reexamining at the final hearing matter that had been dealt with on the preliminary application given that under D.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a lack of factual particularity, the superior court dismissed informations that accused defendants of soliciting for lewd and immoral purposes, in violation of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2701. The court considered whether the informations alleged all of the elements necessary to constitute an offense. The statute itself was not ambiguous and was easy to understand. In its prior decisions, the court had held that a charge under &sect; 22-2701 was limited to solicitations for acts of sodomy. This construction of the statute placed defendants on clear notice that they had been charged with solicitation for sodomy. The informations were thus adequate to permit the preparation of a defense. The need for additional facts should have been addressed with a request for a bill of particulars, not with dismissal. Nor was the State required to elect between charges of prostitution or solicitation for lewd and immoral purposes, as the superior court erroneously held. Both charges could be contained in a single information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States appealed an order from the Superior Court of the District of Columbia dismissing the indictments against four defendants for alleged assaults against police officers and challenged the lower court's finding that the extraterritorial effect of D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-505(a) (1973) applied to all officers covered by &sect; 22-505(a) and that it had no jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-923(b)(1) (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-505(a) for allegedly assaulting several police officers employed by the District. Section 22-505(a) criminalized the assault of any officer of any police force, any fire department, or any penal or correctional institution operating in the District, or any officer of the government of the District charged with the supervision of juveniles confined in any facility of the District, whether such facility was located within the District or elsewhere. The lower court interpreted the extraterritorial effect of &sect; 22-505(a) to apply to all the types of officers named in &sect; 22-505(a). The lower court then found that, because its jurisdiction was specifically limited to criminal cases under any law applicable exclusively to the District pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 11-923(b)(1), it had no jurisdiction. On appeal, the court rejected the lower court's interpretation of &sect; 22-505(a) and determined that the extraterritorial effect did not apply, in part, to police officers because of the manner in which the types of officers were added to &sect; 22-505(a). As the indictments pertained to purely local matters, the lower court had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord gave the tenant a 30-day notice to quit. The tenant did not leave the premises after 30 days.

The tenant claimed that the protective order was invalid and that disbursement of the funds to the landlord without an evidentiary hearing violated due process. The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded to the trial court. The court held that the requirements of a written motion under D.C. Super. Ct. R. P. Landlord Tenant Branch 13 were inapplicable to a motion for a protective order made orally on the return date in a possessory action and that due process did not require an evidentiary hearing prior to the entry of the protective order.

The court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that its authority to review actions of the Zoning Commission was limited to decisions or orders in &quot;contested cases&quot;. The court therefore found it had to determine whether the zoning amendments were adjudicative or legislative in nature. The court found that the standards for both issuing regulations and conducting hearings were indicative of legislative action. In determining that halfway houses should be permitted in R-4 and less restricted districts the Commission was not adjudicating the specific rights of any particular property owner. The court found it was making a legislative decision based on its perception of what policy was best for the city to adopt concerning halfway houses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district had conceded that its policy violated D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 47-713 (1973) and agreed to assess all properties at the same percentage in the future, so that the only substantive question was whether the district was required to refund excess taxes collected in the past. The residential taxpayer sought to intervene in order to argue that the practice did not violate &sect; 47-713, both as an additional reason not to require the tax refund and to preserve the district's right to return to the abandoned policy in the future. The trial court denied his motion to intervene on the basis that he had no litigable interest because any harm to residential taxpayers was merely speculative. The court reversed, because there was a substantial possibility that noncommercial taxpayers would incur higher taxes if commercial taxpayers succeeded in obtaining refunds. The court noted that the sufficiency of the interest in the litigation required by D.C. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) for intervention was to be determined by a flexible and practical approach with a view to disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned persons as was compatible with efficiency and due process.</SPAN></P>

The court held that maintaining the action in the District would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and thereby contravene the Due Process Clause. The foreign corporations had purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of transacting business in the District, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of the District's laws. The court reasoned that the foreign corporations caused the local corporation to carry on business activities in the District on their behalf. The domestic corporation's office was located in the District and it was hired to help process an application for a construction grant through a federal agency which was located in the District. Moreover, the District had a manifest interest in providing a forum for its residents when their clients refused to pay fees for services performed in the District.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which dismissed the action of the local corporation for breach on contract and unjust enrichment and quashed service of process for failure to effect proper in personam jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with soliciting for prostitution. The trial court found that &sect; 22-2701 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions that the informations against defendants be reinstated. The court found that &sect; 22-2701 was constitutional because the statute's prohibition against solicitation was commercial speech which was subject to reasonable government regulation. The court determined that the speech involved in soliciting for prostitution was to arrange a purely commercial exchange; in no sense was it an attempt to express social concerns or grievances publicly. The court also found that the regulation was reasonable because there was a legitimate national, state, and community interest in maintaining a decent society, and the stemming of commercialized sexual solicitations was an acceptable means of furthering this interest. The court rejected defendants' argument that since prostitution itself was not proscribed, a statute governing speech concerning such activity was unreasonable, because regulation of business conditions and commercial ventures long had been recognized to be a valid exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were charged with either possession of heroin for personal use or possession of implements of crime (narcotics paraphernalia). Defendants, in a consolidated appeal, sought to reverse the trial court's decision which rejected their proffered defense to the charges. Defendants sought to raise an affirmative defense of lack of criminal responsibility due to heroin addiction. Defendants contended that they were compelled to act, and because of their addiction, they were not criminally responsible, under common law principles, for possession of narcotics. The trial court rejected their proffer of evidence and proposed jury instructions, as well as a subsequent motion to introduce evidence to establish the defense. The appellate court, in affirming the trial court's decision, held that although defendants might be medically addicted, the court was not inclined to change the course of settled principles of criminal responsibility. The appellate court held that the existing criminal scheme already allowed for treatment of addiction and that the existing statutes comported with the court's notices of elemental justice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court incorrectly concluded that the statute was overbroad and unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the sexual proposal clause of &sect; 22-1112(a) was construed to proscribe only proposals to commit sodomy, indecent exposure, or, in the case of sexual proposals addressed to children, to perform some sexual act, and was not so vague as to amount to a deprivation of due process of law. Further, the statute did not require an open or public act or proposal in the common-law sense and was not designed or intended to apply to acts committed or proposals made in privacy in the presence of a single and consenting person.

He failed to return to a halfway house in the District of Columbia and remained away without permission. He was arrested and indicted for prison breach in violation of &sect; 22-2601. The trial court found him guilty. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 22-2601 had to be construed as applying outside as well as within the District and that the trial court had no jurisdiction over cases of prison breach charged under the District of Columbia Code Annotated. The court construed &sect; 22-2601 as applying only to prison breaches that occurred within the District. Therefore, it held that the trial court did have jurisdiction. The court assumed that Congress, in amending &sect; 22-2601, legislated with care. If the court adopted the construction urged by defendant, then the court Congress intended to try all local criminal offenses could not try prisoners accused of escaping within the District from District penal institutions and employees. Such a situation indeed would be absurd. Defendant's trial by a U.S. Const. art. I court for violation of &sect; 22-2601 did not abridge his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee child ran away from home five times in four years. The last three times were in a nine-month period. The petition alleged that she was a child in need of services. On appeal, the court considered only whether the CINS statute was void for vagueness. The court reversed and held that the test was whether the prohibitions were set out in terms that an ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense could sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interest, and that the CINS statute, adopted from uniform act language, met any notice or fair warning requirements because children of ordinary understanding knew that to repeatedly abscond from home in defiance of the lawful commands of one's parent was a rather drastic form of disobedience that could precipitate some disciplinary or punitive action. The court held that it would not consider hypothetical arguments as to all persons to whom the statute might apply in the absence of an apparent First Amendment speech infringement. The court noted that even First Amendment issues must be balanced against the need for parental discipline and to a lesser extent, state enforcement of such discipline.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused was handed a subpoena to appear before a grand jury when he came to the United States Attorney's office seeking a property release of his truck. He was not told that he was considered a potential defendant in a prosecution about a motorcycle theft. In the presence of the grand jury, the accused was advised of his rights in a manner the trial court characterized as inadequate. The court stated that the deficiency in that advice arose from failure to maintain a scrupulous concern that waiver was required to be knowingly and intelligently made. Another shortcoming was in the prosecutor's waiting until after administering an oath in the cloister of the grand jury before undertaking to furnish what advice was given. If the standard of review that discretionary action could not have been upset save for an abuse of that discretion were to be applied, the court would have been obliged to look to all circumstances of the case and to decide if the grand jury should have been required to reconsider indicting the accused without his testimony. The grand jury evidence was not to be quantitatively viewed without considering the accused's testimony because of the suppression order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police entered the claimant's premises and seized his currency that was allegedly used in an illegal gambling enterprise. The superior court granted the government's motion to strike the claimant's jury demand. After a trial before the superior court, the seized currency was forfeited to the government. The court ordered that the claimant was entitled to a jury trial in the government's libel action pursuant to &sect; 22-1505(c). The test to determine whether the claimant was entitled to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution depended on the nature of the issue that was to be tried, rather than the character of the overall action. The libel action to determine the illegality of the use of the currency did not fall within the nuisance exception to the general rule that a jury trial was required before one could be deprived of his property. When property that was not per se unlawful was sought to be forfeited pursuant to &sect; 22-105(c), the claimant was entitled to a trial by jury to determine whether the property was illegally employed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Government filed a petition alleging juvenile delinquency on the part of defendant because he had violated 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 841(a) (1970) by knowingly and intentionally distributing a controlled substance. The trial court dismissed the Government's petition because it found that it had no jurisdiction, as the offense on which the petition was based was a federal offense. On appeal, the Government argued that, as juvenile delinquency was a local concern, the trial court had primary jurisdiction and that the federal court only obtained jurisdiction in the event that the trial court released its jurisdiction. Defendant argued that where a violation of a federal statute was alleged, the local court could assume jurisdiction only if the federal court waived its primary jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 50001. The court agreed with the Government and noted that D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 16-2301(7) (1973) provided for jurisdiction by the trial court even though the offense on which the delinquency petition was based was a violation of federal law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter cast his vote in a general election for a write-in candidate. The board refused to count the vote and claimed that the District of Columbia Election Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-1101 et seq. (1973) allowed the board to count only votes for those whose names appeared on the ballot and that it could not provide space for write-in votes which by the Act it was not permitted to count. On appeal the court held that the Act provided for nomination of candidates for presidential electors by executive committees of major parties and by petition and provided the exclusive means under which candidates may have their names printed on the ballots, and that the board did not need to count votes for candidates for whom no slate of electors had been filed. But the court found nothing in the statute which precluded the counting of write-in votes where such votes were cast for candidates for whom a valid slate of electors had been filed, that such votes should have been counted, and that the board should utilize its rule-making powers to facilitate write-in votes in the future.</SPAN></P>

The police asked if they could look in the trunk, defendant consented, and the stolen battery was found. Thereafter defendant was arrested, arraigned, and released on his own recognizance. After failing to appear for trial, defendant was arrested pursuant to a bench warrant. On appeal, the court found that pursuant to D.C.

In addition, the court held that the trial court did not erred in denying defendant's pretrial motion to suppress the stolen battery. The court found that when the police apprehended persons fitting a description of recent participants in a theft in a car, the police could immediately search the car to uncover the fruits of the crime.

He also had been charged with threatening a prospective witness and attempting to obstruct justice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applicant challenged a decision from respondent District of Columbia Board of Zoning Adjustment, which denied its request for a zoning variance based on undue hardship. The applicant sought to convert and existing religious seminary in the R-1-B zoning classification to a convalescent or nursing home as defined in the District of Columbia Zoning Regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seminary was built pursuant to a special exception granted by the Board. It was zoned R-1-B and was surrounded by single family detached residences. The applicant claimed an inability to transfer the facility to other religious or educational institutions and requested a variance on the ground that development of the property for R-1-B use would result in undue financial hardship. The court found that the Board erred when it took the position that a variance could only be issued when the required hardship inhered in land as opposed to property. Moreover, the court rejected the Board's claim that the applicant could not complain because any hardship was self-imposed. It was not the building of the structure in 1961 which gave rise to the complained of hardship, the building was utilized for its intended purpose as a seminary for a number of years. An extraordinary drop in enrollment of seminarians caused the hardship. Finally, the Board's finding regarding alteration of the residential character of the neighborhood by increased traffic and influx of commercial vehicles was not supported by the record and was therefore deficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged on a printed form information by a check made solely in the box designating &quot;indecent act: commit a lewd, obscene, and indecent act in violation of D.C.

The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the informations. The court held that the part of &sect; 22-1112(a) under which defendants were charged was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give clear notice of what conduct was forbidden and invested the police with excessive discretion to decide, after the fact, who had violated the law. The court held that the words &quot;lewd&quot; and &quot;indecent&quot; were not paired with other words, which might have provided a context in which the words could be given meaning, nor did the police themselves have a uniform view of the meaning of the particular statutory language. The court vacated the order of the trial court insofar as it purported to enjoin notification of arrests for all other sex offenses because there was no person before the court who has sustained a direct injury as a result of the notification policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that all that was intended by D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 36-403(a)(2), (b)(2) (1973) was to delay for a period of six months the application of the new minimum wage rates to employees affected by an earlier wage order, and to require that on and after August 1, 1968, the rate of overtime compensation for such employees be fixed by the board after a public hearing. The court concluded that the board did not exceed its statutory authority when, after procedures prescribed by D.C. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-406, 36-407(a)-(c) (1973), it promulgated the new wage order. The court found that there were no disputed questions of adjudicative facts or that any immediate legal right of any specific party was presented to the board for resolution or adjudication; therefore, the proceeding was quasi-legislative that did not require a &quot;contested case&quot; type hearing. The court found that a board member's bias did not disqualify him, because it was a proceeding quasi-legislative in character conducted by a tripartite board. The court found that the nature of the tripartite board was that two members were to be partisan (one for employers and the other for employees) with the third to be neutral.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 22-2722 (1973). Defendant challenged his conviction on constitutional grounds, claiming that the statute was vague. The court held that to sustain a conviction under the statute, the government had to prove that acts took place on the premises that disturbed the public or constituted a nuisance per se in the nature of a gambling house or bawdy house, that the premises were regularly resorted to for the commission of these acts, and that the proprietor knew or should have known of the acts and did nothing to prevent them. Because by its decision, the court rendered authoritative construction of the statute and rejected an earlier decision, Payne v. United States, 171 A.2d 509 (D.C. App. 1961), the court concluded that the defendant must be acquitted. The court further held that, because the government did not need to prove that the defendant subverted the public morals, it was not necessary to reach the constitutional vagueness issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple offenses. He challenged the judgment on several grounds, including that it was error to admit into evidence his prior conviction for manslaughter. Defendant's claims included that the prior conviction had no bearing upon his credibility and prejudiced him in the eyes of the jury and that admission of the prior conviction pursuant to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-305(b)(1) (1973) was unconstitutional as applied to him. Affirming, the court held that defendant was not prejudiced because the trial court gave a limiting instruction when the prior conviction was introduced and again during the final instructions, which stated that it was only to be used to evaluate defendant's credibility. The court observed that when D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 14-305(b)(1) (1973) was enacted, the argument that defendant made on appeal was removed by specifically providing that a prior conviction of a felony &quot;shall be admitted&quot; to impeach credibility of the witness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The therapist, who had an accounting degree, practiced for 13 years before passage of the Act. Under the Act, only psychologists licensed by the Board were permitted to practice and formal educational training was a prerequisite to licensure. The therapist brought an action directly challenging the constitutionality of the Act in district court. That case was dismissed due to the therapist's failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The therapist then applied for a license to practice psychology, which was denied due to his lack of academic credentials in the field of psychology. On appeal, the therapist argued that the Act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the decision, holding that the therapist was barred from challenging the constitutionality of the Act on which he relied to initiate the application process. The District of Columbia Administrative Procedure Act, D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 1-1510 (1973), did not authorize the court to pass upon the constitutionality of the statute creating the Board when reviewing the Board's denial of the license application.

The court ruled that the judgment of conviction could not stand because the trial did not meet the minimum standards for the administration of criminal justice due to the trial judge's conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">PDS counsel filed five motions seeking to withdraw as counsel on appeal. These motions described the issues presented in the original motions with more particularity; however, the court denied all the motions. In one case, the court concluded that even an inadvertent failure to raise a constitutional attack as to D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 22-2701 (1967) did not amount to a violation of appellant's Sixth Amendment right to effective representation.In another case, counsel's failure to move for a severance of counts did not raise a question of profession incompetence warranting inquiry under the Sixth Amendment. The court again denied two of the motions without prejudice because it was unable to determine whether a prima facie case for constitutional ineffective existed. The court concluded that the threshold for constitutional ineffectiveness remained at a level sufficient only to cure exceptional cases despite the adoption by the circuit court of a new standard fordirect appeal evaluation of representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and its assessors claimed that several of the taxpayers had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, that the change in level of assessment did not constitute rulemaking, and that the stair-step approach to implementing the change was necessitated by fiscal and manpower shortages.

The court held that exhaustion of administrative remedies was not required and that an action could be maintained to enjoin the assessment of taxes where there were extraordinary circumstances. The court also held that the city and its assessors' actions constituted rulemaking, but that the requisite procedures of publication and an opportunity for a public hearing were not followed in implementing this rule. In addition, the court held that the unequal implementation of such a tax change violated the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantees of equal protection by discriminating among similarly situated residential taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government charged that defendants played and practiced a confidence game and swindle upon a victim by persuading the victim to entrust money to defendants, who intended to fraudulently convert it to their own use. The court held that, for the purposes of &sect; 22-1506, the indictments did not state sufficiently the elements of the offense called the confidence game or swindle known as three-card monte. The chapter in which the statute was set forth was concerned only with gambling activities. Defendants were not charged under the specific three-card monte portion of &sect; 22-1506, but under its general clause concerning &quot;any other confidence game, play, or practice.&quot; As the statute's thrust was against gambling, the general language, &quot;any other confidence game, play, or practice&quot; had to be limited in application to gambling activity similar to three-card monte. For prosecuting the fraud or deceit sought to be punished in the instant case, the three-card monte statute was not a proper vehicle as there were other statutes to deal with such conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, which convicted defendant in a nonjury trial for violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-3501(b) (1967), enticing a minor child to a place for purposes of taking immoral, improper, or indecent liberties with such child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the testimony of the child was insufficiently corroborated by independent evidence to establish each element of the offense. The trial judge credited the government testimony but found defendant's testimony, as well as the testimony of his witnesses, not credible. The child's admitted presence in defendant's apartment was consistent with her version of what took place there. Defendant asserted that the girl wandered into his apartment by herself. An officer testified the building door had been locked, thus corroborating the girl's testimony that someone had opened the door for her. Those factors, coupled with the child's &quot;excited&quot; state when she promptly reported the incident to her mother, led the court to believe the fact finder could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim's account of the crime was not a fabrication. There was sufficient corroboration of the victim's testimony on which to base a finding of guilty to the offense charged. That the statute did not in so many words make unlawful removing the pants of a minor child by a stranger in the privacy of his own apartment did not render it constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. Section 107 was constitutional under a narrow construction because it regulated, for legitimate traffic considerations, only the time, place, and manner of processions and parades. It did not vest unlimited discretion in the police regarding permit determinations, and it was not a tool for the suppression of free expression or assembly. Under &sect;107, only the safety, comfort, and convenience in the use of the streets by the public were to be considered in permit determinations. However, defendant could not be prosecuted under &sect; 107 for parading without a permit because her arrest preceded the authoritative construction of the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of carrying a pistol without a license after the pistol was fired in his brother's apartment. He argued that the trial court erred in admitting the gun and incriminating statements and that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The court stated that a valid waiver of an individual's Miranda rights was also a waiver of his right to presentment without unnecessary delay. The trial court permissibly found that defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights. It was permissible to consider that defendant had had previous experiences with law enforcement in determining whether he was aware of his rights. Although the trial judge commented that he had great doubts about the arresting officers' conduct in repeatedly asking defendant to take them to the gun, his ruling was sustainable under the preponderance standard, and any error in admitting defendant's statement while entertaining a reasonable doubt about voluntariness was at best harmless error. From all the evidence, it was permissible for the jury to infer that the pistol fired was the one that defendant carried to a friend's house and that was later recovered by him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer appealed a decision of respondent, the District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Board. The Board's decision held that, under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 46-303(c)(3) (Supp. 1972), the employer's contribution rate for unemployment compensation insurance was the standard percentage rate because the employer did not qualify for the reduced special rate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board determined that a reduced contribution rate was limited to employers who were &quot;newly subject&quot; or who first became subject to the District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Act after a certain date, or had been subject to the Act for a sufficient period of time to have qualified for a reduced rate. The employer did not meet either of those criteria. On appeal, the court upheld the Board's decision. The court held that the language of the statute was clear and unambiguous. The court also held that the statute, as applied, did not deny the employer equal protection of the law. The statute did not arbitrarily discriminate against employers who were not &quot;newly subject&quot; to the Act in favor of businesses that commenced after the effective date of the statute. The purpose intended by the classification embodied in the statutory scheme was to encourage new business and the resultant increased employment in the District of Columbia so as to have provided a broader tax base. Such a goal was a legitimate one, and the classification adopted was reasonably adapted to the achievement of that goal.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 33-402 (1967).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer obtained a warrant for defendant's arrest, having learned that he was driving while his license was revoked. He subsequently found defendant, told defendant that he was under arrest pursuant to the warrant, and began to search him in accordance with standard procedure. The officer felt an envelope with something in it in defendant's pocket, which he knew from experience was a typical container for contraband. He removed the envelope and found two packets of heroin, and four more were found in a leather purse in another pocket. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the heroin, and the Government appealed. The court reversed, finding that the case involved an unquestionably lawful custodial arrest. In such circumstances, the court concluded that it was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to initiate a careful search of defendant, irrespective of the specific nature of the offense which gave rise to the arrest, and the scope of the search was within the bounds of reasonableness. Thus, the heroin, having been seized pursuant to a constitutionally permissible search, could be used as evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police, at a routine stop and check, saw the butt of a gun through the windshield of defendant's car. The trial court convicted defendant of carrying a pistol without a license in violation of D.C.

On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the officer did not violate any Fourth Amendment constitutional rights of defendant by looking through the windshield and the window of the passenger side of the car. The court also found that the Congress could rationally have determined that felonious conduct within the previous 10 years might justify an increased punishment. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding of constructive possession because ownership was not the test of possession and because proximity in the car and defendant's possession of ammunition for the gun established a basis for constructive possession.</SPAN></P>

The corporation appealed on the grounds that the license revocation was an unconstitutional prior restraint upon the right to exhibit films tantamount to censorship without affording any type of judicial adversary determination, and that D.C.

The court affirmed because reliable, probative, and substantial evidence was not shown to support the conclusion that the revocation of the corporation's license was in the interest of public decency.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was defendant's contention that the disorderly house part of &sect; 22-2722 was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence as to whether the homosexual conduct described was &quot;subversive of the public morals,&quot; which was a part of the common-law definition of the disorderly house offense. The court, however, held that the conviction was one for keeping a bawdy house, as opposed to a disorderly house. Because a bawdy house was at common law a nuisance per se, and was by &sect; 22-2722 declared a nuisance, the court declined to address the question of public values and found it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue. Instead, the court concluded that the statutory scheme of D.C. Code ch. 27 covered more than heterosexual prostitution and that references therein to a bawdy house had to be viewed as relating at least to homosexual prostitution. The evidence showed that defendant was the operator of the house used by males, after payment of an initial membership fee plus a fee for each visit, for a variety of homosexual activities including sodomy. With proof of the element of profit, that house became a bawdy house or house of prostitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of a District of Columbia trial court, which denied him release on bail pending appeal under the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act, 84 Stat. 473-668. Defendant was convicted of second-degree burglary and sentenced to two to six years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was entitled to be released on bail pending appeal of his conviction under D.C. Code Ann. &sect; 23-1325 (1967, Supp. IV, 1971) of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act or that such provision was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the denial of bail. The court noted that under &sect; 23-1325 defendant had to be detained pending appeal unless there was clear and convincing evidence that he was not likely to flee or pose a danger to persons or property and that his appeal raised a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in a reversal or new trial. Considering this conviction and defendant's criminal history, the court concluded that there was evidence that defendant posed a danger to the community and that such finding was sufficient to deny release under &sect; 23-1325. Because defendant's right to appeal his conviction and his release pending appeal were not automatic, but created by statute, and because the statute imposed reasonable conditions upon release, the court concluded that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
