</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order of the Oakland Circuit Court (Michigan), which denied the state's untimely application for leave to appeal a district court order which granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The height of defendant's grass violated a city ordinance, and when he failed to respond to a violation notice, a cut order was issued and assigned to a lawn service for execution. While executing the cut order, a lawn service employee discovered several marijuana plants in buckets. The police were called, and the lawn service's owner provided the detective with two buckets taken from defendant's property along with a statement that he had observed additional plants through a basement window of defendant's home. The detective obtained a search warrant, which he executed at defendant's home. Marijuana and equipment was discovered. Defendant's motion to suppress was granted, and the state appealed. The court reviewed the evidence and held that (1) the search warrant was legally obtained; (2) the objective of the city ordinance, to require property owners to remove or destroy proscribed weeds, was a proper exercise of municipal police power; (3) due process did not require a preabatement hearing and defendant's constitutional guarantees were not infringed; and (4) the lawn service employees did not enter defendant's property with the intent to conduct a search of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court, which granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his residence pursuant to a search warrant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county board of commissioners filed an action for an order of superintending control to prohibit defendant chief circuit judge from taking certain actions pursuant to the county jail overcrowding act (JOA), Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff declared an overcrowding emergency at a county jail pursuant to the JOA. The sheriff and the prosecuting attorney filed actions against the board for additional funding to remedy the problem. The chief circuit judge was disqualified from the action. The chief circuit judge ordered the transfer of prisoners to other county jails, classified the prisoners into low-risk and high-risk groups, and prohibited the sheriff from releasing prisoners. The board filed an action against the chief circuit judge for an order of superintending control. Upon review, the court granted the order in part. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 801.56(3) gave the chief circuit judge broad discretion to classify prisoners, that he had not abused his discretion, and that the board lacked standing to challenge the classification. The court ruled that the chief circuit judge exceeded his authority by prohibiting the sheriff from releasing high-risk prisoners as permitted by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 801.57. In addition, the court determined that the chief circuit judge lacked the authority pursuant to the JOA to administratively order the transfer of prisoners to other county jails.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Many years ago, the corporation granted the railroad an interest in five strips of land. Regarding four strips, the trial court found that the railroad had acquired a fee interest and that any possibility of reverter possessed by the corporation was extinguished pursuant to 1968 Mich. Pub. Acts 13 (act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 554.61 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 26.49(11) et seq.). Regarding the fifth strip, the trial court found that the railroad only acquired an easement that was terminated by abandonment. Because mere nonuse did not constitute abandonment, the court reversed judgment declaring that the railroad's easement interest in the northernmost strip of land was terminated by abandonment. However, the court affirmed the judgment declaring that the act extinguished the corporation's possibilities of reverter because the corporation never recorded a written notice of its desire to preserve any possibility of reverter. The act also did not unconstitutionally impair the obligation of contract because it provided means to preserve interests created more than 30 years before the act's effective date. Nor did the act deprive the corporation of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and complainant had been boyfriend and girlfriend for some months. Shortly after they broke up, or while they were having difficulties in their relationship, depending on whether one believed defendant or complainant, defendant and complainant had sexual relations. Complainant claimed that defendant forced her to engage in the relations at knifepoint, defendant claimed the relations were consensual. Defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree. Defendant filed a motion to introduce evidence of the prior sexual relationship between him and complainant. Without holding a hearing to determine the admissibility of the proposed evidence, the trial court denied the motion on the ground that defendant had failed to comply with the notice provision of the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j. Where the issue related only to the prior sexual relationship between complainant and defendant, the ten-day notice provision and hearing requirements served no useful purpose, as the prosecution did not need to locate and interview witnesses to develop, and the interests sought to be protected by the rape shield statute were not involved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that denial of defendant's motion to introduce evidence of past sexual relations between him and the complainant was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and it reversed defendant's conviction and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, fireworks business proprietor and employees (business), brought an action against appellants, city and individual employees (city), under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan) declared the city's fireworks ordinance invalid, issued injunctions against the city, found the city in contempt, awarded economic loss damages to the business, and declared a mistrial. The court consolidated the city's appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were involved in an ongoing dispute related to the business' right to sell fireworks under Detroit, Mich., Ordinance &sect; 19-3-67. Pursuant to an intervening Michigan Supreme Court ruling, the court held that the ordinance was not preempted by, nor in conflict with, the Michigan Fireworks Act (act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.243a(3)(a-g); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.440(1)(3)(a-g), and that the city's overall scheme of regulation was a valid exercise of the police power. The court also held that under the act both the city and the state were entitled to regulate or prosecute sales at retail to individuals who did not ship fireworks out of Michigan. Because the trial court made its various rulings under the incorrect assumptions that the ordinance as a whole was invalid and that attempts to regulate the alleged out-of-state sales were improper, the court concluded that almost all of the trial court's findings would need to be revisited upon remand. Additionally, the trial court would have to determine whether the ordinance stated an adequate standard for the guidance of the licensing officials. The court held that the trial court's contempt finding against the city was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment insofar as it declared the ordinance invalid. The court affirmed the denial of the city's motion for summary disposition of the business' civil rights claim and also affirmed the finding that the city was in contempt for violation of injunctions. The court remanded numerous issues to the trial court for reconsideration in light of the court's holding that the city's overall regulatory scheme was valid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fled the scene, but was located at a hospital while undergoing surgery to remove the bullet. Hospital personnel gave police a bag containing defendant's clothing. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the clothing, relying on the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. Defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that the warrantless search fell within the plain view exception. The court found that the seizure without a warrant of defendant's clothing was unconstitutional because it did not fall within any recognized exception to the warrant requirement. The court determined that the hospital possessed defendant's clothing as a bailee, which meant that they did not enjoy mutual use of the clothing such that they could consent to its seizure without a warrant. Nevertheless, the court held that the admission of the clothing was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt based upon the strength of the victim's identification of defendant and defendant's bullet wound.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter, a minor, became pregnant when she was raped. Both mother and daughter were indigent and eligible for state medical assistance payments through the state's Medicaid program, and the mother sought medical assistance coverage for a therapeutic abortion for the daughter. The trial court upheld the DSS's refusal to pay for the abortion, finding that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 400.109a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16.490(19a)) prohibited state Medicaid funding of the requested abortion and that &sect; 109a was not violative of the Michigan Constitution. The court reversed and remanded. The Michigan constitution afforded women a right to abortion, and the effect of the adoption of &sect; 109a was to impinge on the daughter's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Because the state had failed to show a compelling interest to justify &sect; 109a's impingement on the right of a woman to terminate her first-trimester pregnancy, the court held that exclusion from the Medicaid program of indigent pregnant women who elected medically necessary abortions in lieu of carrying the pregnancy to term was a denial of equal protection of the law guaranteed by Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief judge of the circuit court posted a list of approved bail bondsmen pursuant to the provisions of Mich.

The court found that the use of the word &quot;shall&quot; in subsection (4) required that any bondsman who was engaged in the business of becoming surety shall be added to the list upon proper application, and that the determination of whether a particular bondsman's license should be revoked and the bondsman thereafter removed from the list was left to the Insurance Commissioner under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.1242(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.11242(2)). The court ruled that the statutes relegating the licensing and regulation of surety bondsmen to the Insurance Commissioner did not impermissibly intrude upon the inherent judicial power or on the judicial function of setting bail. The court granted an order of superintending control because the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction and authority in removing the bail bondsman from the list of approved bondsmen, as there was no statutory authority for the court's action.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 8, was to be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SBTA, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1 et seq. (1975) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.558(1) et seq.), imposed a value-added tax using a consumption-type base. After the initial tax base was determined, it was apportioned between Michigan and other states in which a taxpayer did business. The corporation was a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois, and successfully sought to recover the single business taxes it paid in the years 1981-84 by arguing that &sect; 23 of the CAD violated the Commerce Clause because Michigan-based companies received a larger CAD than non-Michigan-based companies. The court of claims found that &sect; 23 was unconstitutional and ordered that its decision was to operate prospectively. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's ruling that its decision operate purely prospectively, finding that the lower court's decision did not overrule clear precedent, and was not &quot;clearly foreshadowed,&quot; as the question of constitutionality of the CAD was one of first impression. Further, the court found that retroactive application of the decision could be potentially devastating for the state, both financially and administratively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of claims' ruling that its decision that the CAD violated the Commerce Clause and had to be severed from the SBTA operate purely prospectively.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court ordered count I quashed and count II dismissed in each case. The People appealed and the court reversed, finding that the circuit court erroneously held that the video poker machines were exempt under Mich. Comp.

On the basis of precedent, the court was compelled to hold that, despite the contract and the plain language of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3109(1), such a setoff was not permissible because the insurer failed to offer to the insured a policy of no-fault insurance that would not coordinate the governmental benefit. The court held that if it &quot;were writing on a clean slate,&quot; it would decide in the insurer's favor. Duplication of governmental benefits was repugnant to the purposes and objectives of the no-fault act and to the plain language of &sect; 3109(1). Nevertheless, the state supreme court had rejected the insurer's position. The court was unable to rationally distinguish the social security disability benefits at issue from the federal military medical benefits addressed in the previous case.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to 1985 Mich. Pub. Acts 103, the magistrate determined that defendant employers were to be reimbursed for payments exceeding the 52-week limit that were made after July 30, 1985.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.921 stated, in part, that a person certified as vocationally handicapped was to be compensated for a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment and resulting in death or disability. The statute was amended by 1985 Mich. Pub. Acts 103 to reduce the period of liability from 104 to 52 weeks. The claimants were hired and became certified as vocationally handicapped before the July 30, 1985, amendment. The magistrate held that the employers were to be reimbursed for payments exceeding the 52-week limit that were made after July 30, 1985. The Commission affirmed, concluding that the magistrate's application of the amendment was prospective. The fund appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the application of &sect; 921 to the claimants might include some antecedent events, but the statute was applied only to disability payments accruing after July 30, 1985. The fund's liability increased only after the effective date of the amendment. Thus, the amendment was not applied retroactively. Also, the court held that benefits and liabilities arising out of the workers' compensation statute did not create rights protected by the Contract Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder was infirm and must be vacated because there was no such criminal offense. The court vacated defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree murder but affirmed his conviction for second-degree murder. The court held that, as a matter of law, there was no crime of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. The court found that the elements of a conspiracy were inconsistent and incompatible with second-degree murder. The gist of a criminal conspiracy was the specific, mutual agreement to perform the crime in question. Second-degree murder was distinguishable from first-degree murder in that it did not require premeditation and in fact did not necessarily require a specific intent to kill. The court stated that a person could not plan to commit an unplanned substantive crime. It was not absence of the elements but the inconsistency of the elements, which lead the court to conclude that one conspires to commit first-degree murder but not second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of second-degree murder was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Genesee Circuit Court (Michigan), which convicted him of violating the cigarette tax act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.501 et seq., on three separate occasions. Defendant was sentenced to 24 months' probation, with the last 30 days to be served in the county jail if he failed to comply with the terms and conditions of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Testimony presented by the State established that defendant paid for cigarettes that were offered for sale in the store where he worked by undercover officers who were investigating suspected violations of the act. Defendant bargained with the officers before agreeing on a price that was well below the average wholesale price. A treasury agent later purchased cigarettes that were determined to be those sold to defendant by the officers. Other evidence showed that neither defendant nor the officers who sold defendant the cigarettes were licensed under the act, and that no records were kept of the sales. Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of violating the cigarette tax act, &sect; 205.501 et seq. On appeal, the court held that there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of violating the act's provisions, or of aiding and abetting their violation, even though defendant did not own the store and was allegedly acting at the store owner's direction. The act did not require that the cigarettes be acquired for defendant's use, sale, or distribution. Thus, ownership of the store was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's judgment of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that, as a matter of law, no factual development could possibly justify a right of recovery under count V of the taxpayers' amended complaint. The fact finder had erred in denying the state's' motion for partial summary disposition. The court remanded the case, instructing the fact finder to determine the necessary costs of providing the above-mentioned services in a manner consistent with the opinion, determine what proportion of those necessary costs were reimbursed by the state with categorical aid, determine whether the state violated its funding obligations under Const. 1963, art 9, &sect; 29, and determine the dollar amount of any under-funding occurring in violation of &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional and if the ordinance was constitutional then the city's authority to collect the utility tax had expired. In response the city argued that the termination date contained in Mich. Comp.

The trial court ruled that the taxing authority of the city had expired. The court held that the termination provision did not introduce into the legislation a subject diverse in nature from the main object of the act. The court also determined that the population classification included in the act was reasonably related to the need for an additional source of revenue to hire and retain police officers. Therefore, there was no error in upholding the constitutionality of the act and in finding that the act had expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee trustee initiated an action against the Michigan treasury department to recover amounts paid as taxes on the income accumulated by a trust. All of the income-producing trust property was located in Florida while the only trust property in Michigan was nonincome-producing. Both the income beneficiary of the trust and the trustee were domiciled in Florida and the trust was administered and registered in Florida. The treasury department imposed the tax on the basis that it viewed the trust as a resident trust under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.18 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(118)), which defined a resident trust as one created by a person domiciled in Michigan at the time the trust became irrevocable. The trial court held Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 206.18 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.557(118)) to be unconstitutional as applied to the present case. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there were insufficient connections between the trust and the state to justify the imposition of an income tax. The court elected to follow the line of cases restricting the state's power to impose tax on resident trusts where neither the trustee nor the trust property was within the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on citizen complaints, the police installed cameras in the men's public rest rooms located at a rest area. On the strength of videotapes made from this surveillance, defendants were arrested for gross indecency between males.

The prosecution filed a motion for immediate consideration, motion for stay, application for leave to appeal, and motion for peremptory reversal of the trial court's suppression of the videotape evidence, which the court granted. The court denied the motion for peremptory reversal as to the constitutional attack on the gross indecency statute. After consideration, however, the court reversed the trial court's order, finding that the gross indecency statute did not violate defendants' right to due process because they were forewarned that the conduct in which they engaged was prohibited by the statute. The court remanded, leaving to the jury the question whether defendants' actions constituted gross indecency under the &quot;common sense of society&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that he should have been fined only $ 40 as he if had pled guilty pursuant to the schedule of fines authorized by the district court pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.8391. The court reversed, holding that the establishment of a Traffic Violations Bureau and a scheduled fine system created for the traffic court defendant a circumstance different from the ordinary criminal case where the defendant is subject to the judge's sentence discretion whether he pleads guilty or is convicted after a trial. A traffic court defendant, if he pleads guilty to certain offenses within any time limits that may be prescribed therefor, can be assured that he will be fined exactly the same amount as any other person pleading guilty to the same offense no matter how disparate the prior driving records of the two defendants may be.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Illinois nonprofit corporation appealed from the opinion and judgment of the tax tribunal (Michigan) that vacated the proposed judgment of the hearing officer and denying the nonprofit's claim that it was entitled to a tax exemption for its property located in respondent township, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.7-o (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.7(4-1)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit had been granted a tax exemption by the township for its property, but was subsequently put on the township's tax roles. The hearing officer entered his proposed judgment that had ordered that the nonprofit's claim requesting a charitable exemption for all of the its property should have been granted. The tax tribunal expressly ruled that the nonprofit's property was taxable because the property did not qualify for an exemption because the nonprofit was an Illinois corporation not incorporated under the laws of Michigan as required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.7-o (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.7(4-1)). The court reversed and remanded because the township could not have denied an otherwise qualified out-of-state institution tax exempt status because it was incorporated in another state. Therefore, the court believed that the tax tribunal had made an error of law and adopted a wrong principle when it concluded that the nonprofit was not entitled to tax exempt status because it was incorporated in a foreign state. The court remanded for a decision as to whether the nonprofit had satisfied the other requirements for an exemption under the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed that Act 230 was constitutional and held that when possible statutes should be construed as constitutional. On appeal the taxpayers raised eight issues, none of which had merit. The court held that Act 230 permitted the hospital to remain as it was created and took away none of the &quot;rights&quot; claimed if the county board acted to exempt the hospital from the provisions of Act 230. The court held that Act 230 did not violate the taxpayers' equal protection and due process rights because all persons situated similarly to the taxpayers' were treated alike. The court held that Act 230 did not violate taxpayers' procedural and substantive due process rights because Act 230 did not deprive any person of any personal right or personal property right without affording the county board an opportunity to accept or reject the invitation. The court held that Act 230 did not violate the title-object clause of the Michigan Constitution because all of the provisions of Act 230 related directly to one object, the incorporation of county health facilities corporations and subsidiaries for health care purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the city's ordinance did not fall within the exceptions established by the Act under 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 434 because the city's ordinance was more stringent than the regulations enacted by the United States Secretary of Transportation, which specifically designated permissible operating speeds for various classes of track under 49 C.F.R. &sect; 213.9. The court further held that the city's ordinance also did not fit into a second exception under 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 434 because only a state was able to adopt more stringent railway safety laws in response to a local safety hazard.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that under the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 541(a)(2), it was entitled to use prior telephone pole easements dedicated to compatible uses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed trespass claims after defendant cable television company used telephone poles on plaintiffs' property to install cable lines. Defendant argued that under the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 541(a)(2), private easements granted by plaintiffs to public utilities to install telephone, telegraph, and other lines across their properties were &quot;dedicated to compatible uses&quot; under the statute and that defendant could use these easements to install their cable lines. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary disposition. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court examined the plain language, the legislative history, and judicial interpretations of the Act. Joining the majority view, the court held that the Act gave defendant a federal right to use any easements, public or private, dedicated to compatible uses. The original 1922 interests were not licenses, merely permission to do an act on plaintiffs' land, but true easements, long-term assignable interests. The Act's provision for just compensation adequately addressed any additional burden on plaintiffs' property that might have been caused by defendant's installation.</SPAN></P>

The city initiated criminal proceedings against the transferees and thereafter the transferee's filed a declaratory judgment action that sought to declare the ordinance unconstitutional. The circuit court found the ordinance constitutional and the court affirmed. The court held that under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.532 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2891(12)), the city was only required to give the transferees notice of the existence of an alleged violation of an ordinance prior to initiating an action in the case of inspections, they were not required to do so in every instance where they attempted to enforce their own housing standards. The court also determined that the city was not overstepping its statutory authority where they provided that each day of violation of the ordinance constituted a separate offense because it was a general penalty provision applied to violations of the ordinance where none other was specified.</SPAN></P>

In the owner's action to recover the same the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's denial of the owner's summary judgment motion and the grant of summary disposition to the police department. The court held that the police department could not retain the property without authority under the law and that the owner as the prior possessor had a superior right to possession of the same, therefore the court rejected the police department's argument that the owner lacked standing because others actually owned the items. Because the owner was a convicted felon he was not entitled to possession of firearms, however the court held that he could designate an individual to receive the guns or produce the owners. The court held that the unregistered handguns seized were contraband pursuant to Detroit, Mi., Ordinances &sect; 38-10-61 and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 28.422, 750.232a, 750.222 (Mich. Stat.

The court declined to limit Eastway to a purely prospective application and concluded that the board erred in taking that position. The court ruled that benefits paid prior to the release date of Eastway remained unaffected by the Eastway holding, but that any unpaid benefits due pursuant to a pre-Eastway award or an appeal pending before the board on January 17, 1985, should be determined with reference to &sect; 115 under the post-Eastway law.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners contended that the DSS' policy of considering one spouse's receipt of SSI benefits, for purposes of assessing the eligibility of the other spouse for general assistance benefits, was invalid because: (1) it created an improper irrebuttable presumption in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) it was preempted by provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 601 et seq.; (3) it deprived the wife of her property without due process of law; and (4) it violated the rule-making requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. On appeal, the court rejected each of those arguments and affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the decision of a trial court (Michigan), which ordered the State to elect between proceeding to trial on the charge of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or with an unlawful blood alcohol level, in excess of 0.10 percent by weight of alcohol contrary to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625 or proceeding against defendant only for driving while impaired in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant argued that the sentencing enhancement provisions of the drunk driving statutes were unconstitutional because they infringed upon her right to a trial, precluded her from entering a voluntary guilty plea, and prevented her from receiving effective assistance of counsel. The State contended that the dilemma that existed because of the sentence enhancement provisions was exactly what the legislature intended in providing for sentence enhancement for repeat convictions for impaired driving. The court held that the principles of due process were not violated because defendant had to choose between pleading guilty to the principal charge or proceeding to trial at the risk of being convicted on the lesser-included offense with the subsequent possibility of sentence enhancement. Therefore, the trial court erred in entering an order that intended to preclude the possibility of sentence enhancement upon a second conviction for impaired drunk driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a petition was filed by the department, the children were removed from their home. The department filed a supplemental petition, which recommended that the department receive permanent custody of the children. Following a hearing, the probate court ordered the termination of the mother and father's parental rights. They appealed. The court affirmed and found that the mother had received notice of the preliminary custody proceeding in accordance with Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.12 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3178(598.12)). Moreover, the higher standard of proof needed to terminate parental rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., and Mich. Ct. R. 5.980 did not deny equal protection to non-Indians. The guardian ad litem's closing argument did not interject his personal beliefs into the dispute. The court found that the prejudicial effect of evidence that the mother and father had engaged in acts of violence in front of the children was outweighed by its probative value. The court also rejected the mother's contention that no culpable neglect on her part was shown. The court noted that the mother had allowed an abusive environment to continue.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the trial court did not err in finding a lack of due diligence on the part of the prosecution because it did not provide even reasonable assistance to defendants in locating the witnesses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township ordinance required a minimum area for each lot of two and one half acres.

The township challenged the ruling of the trial court that the challenged ordinance was unconstitutional. The landowners challenged the ruling that a rezone requirement of one-acre minimum area per lot was an appropriate midsatisfactory use remedy. The court reviewed de novo and affirmed the finding that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it effectively precluded the use of the land for any purpose to which it was reasonably adapted, thereby substantially destroying the value of the property. The court reversed the finding that the rezone was an appropriate midsatisfactory use because appellate court precedent, which held that the remedy of a midsatisfactory use was a violation of the doctrine of separations of powers, should have been applied retroactively.

The trial court dismissed the case, holding that Michigan's negligent homicide statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.324 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.556), was unconstitutional. The state appealed, and the court reversed. The court ruled that the statute was constitutional, reiterating that the legislature, in the exercise of its police power in order to preserve the health, morals, and safety, could constitute something to be a crime that theretofore was not criminal. Thus, it could impose a criminal responsibility for a tort that theretofore carried with it only civil liability. In addition, the elimination of the element of criminal intent did not violate the due process clause where the penalty was relatively small and where a conviction did not gravely besmirch. The court examined the penalties under &sect; 750.324, which were not more than two years in prison and a fine of no more than $ 2,000, and it found that they satisfied the requirements for the elimination of criminal intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy and receiving and concealing stolen property and sentenced as a habitual offender. The convictions were affirmed on appeal, but the case was remanded to consider defendant's claim that the predicate convictions upon which the habitual offender sentence was based were invalid. The trial court ruled that all three prior convictions were valid and defendant appealed. In affirming, the appellate court agreed that it was clear from the record that defendant's guilty pleas on those prior convictions were made knowingly and voluntarily and there was a factual basis to support each plea. Even if the sentence on one of the prior convictions was invalid, that did not invalidate the conviction because the sentence was not an element of the conviction. Also, his convictions for larceny and absconding while on bond on that charge were properly deemed to be separate for habitual offender purposes under the Stoudemire rule, even though they were entered on the same day, because his flight in the face of the larceny charge showed that he had rejected the opportunity to reform, which was the rationale of the Stoudemire rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were not State certified teachers, home-schooled their children. Defendants claimed their home schools made them exempt from the law under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 1561(3)(a) (Mich. Stat.

Defendants argued that the certification requirement violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of their religious beliefs and their Fourteenth Amendment fundamental right to educate their children. In affirming defendants' convictions, the court held that the teacher certification requirement: (1) did not violate defendants' right to the free exercise of religion under the First Amendment or their Fourteenth Amendment right to direct the education of their children, and (2) although parents had a right to control the education of their children, that right was not absolute; parents must nonetheless comply with State laws. The correct test was whether the state's regulation bore a rational relationship to some legitimate state purpose. The court found that the State had a legitimate purpose in requiring the certification of public and non-public schoolteachers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed an action against defendants for issuing a use permit to the NCHA and illegally using public funds. The trial court found in favor of defendants, and the corporation appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the trial court erred in interpreting the term &quot;nonprofit corporation&quot; as used in Mich. Ct. R. 2.201(B)(4)(a). The court determined that under the Nonprofit Corporation Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;450.2108(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect;21.197(108)(2), the corporation was a nonprofit corporation because its purpose did not involve pecuniary profit or gain. However, the court ruled that the corporation did not have standing to maintain the action because it did not claim that it would have sustained any damage as a result of the alleged illegal expenditures. Further, Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 30 did not give the corporation standing because the corporation did not show that the limited exclusive use by the NCHA resulted in an unconstitutional public expenditure for a private purpose. The court held that the corporation did not establish a prima facie case under the Michigan Environmental Protection Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power company applied to the PSC for an increase in the redetermined contract price paid to natural gas companies operating in the Northern Niagaran Reef Trend. The natural gas companies intervened in the proceedings involving the long-term contract with the power company. The PSC denied the application and the subsequent request for a rehearing. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision, finding that the PSC had jurisdiction to regulate changes and contract prices under Act 9 by approving the reasonableness of those prices. Section 10 of Act 9, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 483.110, clearly provided that contract price changes were permitted &quot;by application to and approval by&quot; the PSC. The PSC's actions did not impair or infringe the natural gas companies' rights to freely contract; they were engaged in an extensively regulated area of commerce and executed the contracts after Act 9 was made law. The court gave considerable deference to the PSC's determination of the reasonable redetermined price for natural gas. The court concluded that the natural gas producers did not meet their burden of proving that the PSC decision was unlawful or unsupported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor alleged that the judge could not be impartial because he ruled contrary to legal precedent that the mandatory life sentence provisions of the Public Health Code was unconstitutional and incorrectly ruled on various pretrial matters.

Repeated rulings against a litigant, no matter how erroneous, and how vigorously and consistently expressed, were not disqualifying. Every court, and every member of every appellate court, had to form an opinion as to the merits of the matter before the court and that opinion, pro or con, could not constitute bias or prejudice. The chief judge used the wrong standard to support the order of disqualification because a showing of actual bias was required to disqualify the judge.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court directed that the court could have held either that the retired federal employee and other similarly situated federal employees were entitled to the same favorable tax treatment as their state and local counterparts, or that retired state and local employees had to be taxed in the same fashion as their federal counterparts. The court held that the extension of the benefit to the retired federal employees was the preferred means of redress because it avoided the hardship that would have ensued if the favored class was made to do without its accustomed beneficial treatment.

Plaintiffs thereafter filed a complaint for injunctive relief. Before the ruling, the association was temporarily restrained for penalizing plaintiffs for the student's participation in athletics. The circuit court denied plaintiffs' requested relief. The association proposed an order which would penalize plaintiffs for the student's participation in accordance with its regulations. The circuit court rejected the proposed order and entered a final judgment of no cause of action in favor of the association, from which the association appealed. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the association's regulation was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unlawful, that the punitive rule evidenced a manifest abuse of discretion, and that pursuant to the court's authority under Mich. Ct. R. 7.216(A)(7), the association could not impose sanctions against a school district which allowed a student to participate in athletics pursuant to a court order.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor presented sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could conclude that the parents did not supply a certificated teacher to instruct their children. The state requirement of certification (requirement) of teachers was constitutional under the First Amendment right to free exercise of religious beliefs. It did not violate the parents' right to freely exercise their religion. The requirement also satisfied Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process guarantees. The requirement was the least obtrusive means of achieving the state's interest. Although the parents had a right to control the education of their children, that right was not absolute. The parents had to comply with state laws. The correct test was whether the state's regulation bore a rational relationship to some legitimate state purpose.

The prosecutor appealed, and the court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.338 (Mich. Stat.

The court ruled that the act of mutual masturbation was an ultimate sex act and when committed in public, it was an act of gross indecency. The court held that the trial court erred when it found that defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common area of the restroom. The court ruled that videotapes of activities that took place in the common area of the restroom did not violate the constitutional right to privacy guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The court held that the trial court's ruling on the motion to suppress was clearly erroneous. The police did not need a warrant to monitor or videotape the common area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the corporation, a Delaware entity, merged with its two Michigan corporations, the commission assigned a 9 percent unemployment contribution rate for its first year. The trial court reversed the order and established the contribution rate at 5.7 percent, and both parties appealed. The court affirmed the judgment, noting that a 2.7 percent rate was normally assigned to new employers in accordance with &sect; 421.22(e). A variation from the rate setting procedure in &sect; 421.19 occurred in the event of a transfer of a business, and &sect; 421.22(e) applied. The trial court adopted a weighted approach in establishing the contribution rate, relying on two legislative resolutions. The court ruled that although the resolutions were not binding, they were entitled to respectful consideration. The court noted that it also gave respectful consideration to the commission's interpretation of a statute, but the court was not bound by it. The court rejected the commission's claim that the contribution rate was properly based on balances in the employer's experience account and it agreed with the trial court's interpretation of &sect; 421.22(e) as requiring application of a weighted average approach.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the State could not have, through Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 18.1350(2), attribute to local units of government that portion of State spending for county mental health services because to do so violated Mich. Const. art. IX, &sect; 30 (1963), which provided that the proportion of total state spending paid to all units of local government was not reducible below that proportion in effect in fiscal year 1978-79. The statute provided that if the State incurred the cost of county mental health services provided after September 30, 1981, on behalf of a unit of local government, payment was counted as state spending to the unit. The court held that the State money, even though technically paid to a local unit of government, remained State spending because the county was merely discharging the state's obligation to provide mental health services. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the statute was unconstitutional because where a county failed to demonstrate the capacity to provide an adequate mental health care system, the State was still responsible for providing those services and state funds expended for such purposes remained state funds.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that the sentencing court erred by relying on inaccurate information in defendant's presentence investigation report and that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional. At sentencing, defendant alleged that the presentence report's statement that defendant had been dealing cocaine and marijuana for the last nine years was not true. Defendant stated he had been selling cocaine for only the two previous years, but admitted to selling marijuana since he was 14. The sentencing court ruled that the inaccuracies in the presentence report were either not relevant or of little weight to the sentencing court's decision on a sentence for defendant. The court held that, because the sentencing court responded to defendant's allegations and did not rely on the claimed inaccuracies when determining his sentence, his claim had no merit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a township and township board of appeals (township), appealed the decision of the circuit court (Michigan), which entered a judgment for plaintiff landowners permanently enjoining the township from applying the township's private road ordinance relative to the landowners' property and awarding the landowners attorney fees, in an inverse condemnation action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Michigan's Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners purchased two parcels of lakefront property. The only access to the parcels was by an easement connecting to a public road. The easement did not meet the minimum requirements for a private road ordinance provided the Brandon Township Private Road Ordinance, art. VII, &sect; 7.1. Without a private road, the landowners were only entitled to build one building permit, although the landowners desired to build a house on each parcel. The landowners' request for a variance was denied and the landowners filed an inverse condemnation action alleging claims under &sect; 1983 and &sect; 213.66(2); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8.265(16)(2) of Michigan's Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act. The circuit court found that enforcement of the private road ordinance constituted a temporary, regulatory taking of property without compensation, enjoined enforcement of the ordinance, and awarded attorneys' fees to the landowners. On review, the court affirmed, holding, among other things, that the landowners were not required to exhaust state remedies before alleging a &sect; 1983 claim. The court concluded that the private road ordinance constituted a regulatory taking of one of the landowners' two parcels.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's request for an instruction on the defense of voluntary intoxication. On appeal the court reversed, holding that: (1) the trial court erred by depriving defendant of the defense of voluntary intoxication and by not correctly instructing the jury regarding the intent element of torture and the defense of voluntary intoxication because child torture was a specific intent crime which required a showing of an intent to inflict an intensified degree of pain or injury, an intent that surpassed the commission of the proscribed act of torture and (2) the evidence of infliction of torture was not insufficient as a matter of law because, when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant participated in the largest reported Ponzi scheme in the history of the state, and he pled nolo contendere to larceny by false pretenses in exchange for dismissal of multiple counts under the Michigan Uniform Securities Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 451.501 et seq.; Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19.776(101). He appealed, and the court determined that holding two trials in substantially identical cases would have been unnecessarily duplicative and excessive. Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to sever defendant's trial from his co-defendant's trial. Where all of defendant's alleged crimes arose out of a single criminal scheme, it was proper to join them in one trial. Further, the trial court did not exceed its authority by ordering defendant to pay restitution. Yet, the lower court exceeded its sentencing power by prohibiting defendant's parole or release to a halfway house until restitution was made and by ordering the attorney general to enjoin the department of corrections from releasing defendant until that time. Accordingly, the court struck these conditions from defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared the statutory disparities unconstitutional and violative of the right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that distinctions made between two groups of district judges resulted in the 36th District judges receiving more favorable salary terms, lesser contribution obligations to the judges' retirement system, and more generous retirement benefits than other district judges. On appeal, the court found that the statutory scheme violated equal protection but that damages were inappropriate as a matter of law. The court vacated the judgment and dismissed the action because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Under a rational relationship test there was no discernable constitutionally appropriate basis for the disparities that allowed the court to find a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation or to find that the preferred compensation treatment was not arbitrary. The trial court could only grant declaratory relief when the underlying dispute lent itself to a remedy in money damages against the state. Since this case could not be remedied by damages, plaintiff did not have a claim within Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.6419(1) (Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building owner applied to the Zoning Board of Appeals for a variance from the zoning ordinance size limit on wall signs. The Board denied the request and appellants sought review before the circuit court, which granted summary disposition to the City. Appellants again sought review, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. The court stated that an ordinance was unconstitutional if plaintiffs showed that there was no reasonable governmental interest being advanced or that the ordinance was unreasonable because of the arbitrary, capricious, and unfounded exclusion of other types of legitimate use for the property in question. The court found that one purpose of the size limitation was the city's concern with traffic regulation, and held that such purpose formed a reasonable basis for the ordinance. The court determined, however, that the ordinance was arbitrary in that, depending on the number of tenants in the building, signs could be erected in compliance with the law ranging from 100 square feet to over 700 square feet. The court concluded that the ordinance arbitrarily penalized a sole tenant located in a large building while treating multiple tenants fairly.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7521 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.15(7521), based upon the alleged use of the property to facilitate the violation of a controlled substance provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner contended that the statute was vague in violation of the due process clauses of the Illinois and United States constitutions. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The statute gave fair notice of the conduct which would give rise to forfeiture. The statute could be reasonably understood to apply to real estate, and the use of real estate to store or distribute controlled substances constituted facilitation of drug violations. Furthermore, the trial court properly found that the subject real estate was used to facilitate violation of controlled substance provisions where the residence was used as a location for deliveries of drugs. The court noted the potential for abuse of forfeiture and held that, where a dwelling's connection to the use of drugs was negligible, de minimis, tangential, or incidental, the nexus to the drug activity was lacking, and the dwelling was not subject to forfeiture. Where a dwelling was regularly used to manufacture, store, and sell drugs, the nexus was clear, and such dwelling was subject to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 451.501 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19.776(101)). His plea was conditioned, in part, upon his appeal, which challenged various provisions of the Act. Defendant contended that provisions of the Act were unconstitutional because their violation did not require proof of scienter or &quot;guilty knowledge&quot; as a necessary element. Defendant argued that the word &quot;willfully&quot;, as used in the penalty provision of the Act, meant that he was required to have had mens rea or scienter in order to have violated the Act. The court determined that a willful violation of the Act required only that the defendant intended to commit the act or omission found to be material or misleading. It was not necessary for the defendant to have acted with a conscious purpose or specific intent to mislead.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 552.451 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the father were married in Texas and their only child was born in Arizona, where the father continued to reside after the mother left with the child. After the mother moved to Michigan and sought financial assistance through the Department, the Department initiated an action under the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (RURESA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.151 et seq. However, unsatisfied with the progress on the RURESA action in Arizona, the Department dismissed the action without prejudice and initiated the present action on behalf of the mother under the Family Support Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 552.451 et seq. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment, holding that the only fact established with respect to the threshold requirement for jurisdiction was that the mother and child resided in Michigan, which was not caused by any act of the father, and that the circuit court thus lacked personal jurisdiction over the father because his actions did not constitute the &quot;minimum contacts&quot; with Michigan necessary to justify the maintenance of this action under the federal Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court found that found that there was no inconsistency between Chapter 7 of the Michigan Workers' Disability Compensation Act and Chapter 24 of the Michigan Insurance Code, which both related to the subject matter of setting workers' compensation insurance rates for the Fund. The court reasoned that when two separate statutes related to the same subject matter or shared a common purpose, they were considered statutes in pari materia and must be read together as constituting one law. The court further reasoned that where two statutes encompassed the same subject matter, one being general and the other specific, the specific statute controlled.

The trial court also ruled that Dearborn, Mich., Ordinance &sect;&sect; 4, 5, 6, and 7 violated the Mich. Const. art.

The court agreed with the trial court's finding that the stopping of park users in the city's neighborhoods on no basis other than the wish and the request of the officer making a stop failed to meet the constitutional requirement that the nature of the intrusion be objective.</SPAN></P>

The court first noted that the stay provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.6j(13)(b) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22.13(6j)(13)(b)) intruded into the court's adjudication of its cases and impaired the court's administration of its docket. The court held that the provision attempted to dictate procedure to the court and therefore violated Mich. Const. 1963 art. 3, &sect; 2, which prohibited the legislature's exercise of judicial power. However, the court held that the stay provision was severable from the remainder of the statute. The court then addressed the merits of the challenges. It held that the PSC's decision to use the particular methodology it used to determine rates was a policy decision reviewable only for legality. The PSC's finding that the payments the power company would pay the energy company under the contract would approximate the power company's avoided costs was neither arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, nor an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary disposition for the State. On appeal, the court held that the controlling issue was whether a state supreme court holding, which concerned the validity of ballot proposals, should be given retroactive effect. The prisoners contended that Proposal B was unconstitutional because many of the signatures on the ballot petition were most likely collected more than six months before the petition was filed. The court found that all the pertinent factors favored prospective application of the decision. Retrospective application, which would require proof that the signatures for Proposal B were valid, would probably be impossible. The decision represented a new rule of law that should only be applied prospectively. Giving retroactive effect to the decision would affect a number of ballot proposals that were filed during the interim period between an Attorney General's opinion and the supreme court's decision. The decision was not &quot;clearly foreshadowed.&quot; Also, retrospective application would have a serious disruptive effect on the administration of justice.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 800.283 and 750.92. Defendant had been charged with transporting a hypodermic syringe into a correctional facility in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 800.283. He unsuccessfully moved to quash, arguing that a syringe was not a weapon under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 800.283 prohibited the unauthorized transportation into a correctional facility of a weapon or other implement that could be used to cause injury or to assist a prisoner to escape. On defendant's appeal from his conviction, the court rejected his argument that &sect; 800.283 was unconstitutionally vague. The statute was intended to prohibit weapons and objects similar to weapons that might be used to harm others or make an escape from being brought into prisons. The syringe at issue was an object with weapon-like qualities that could have been used to harm others or make an escape. The court was unpersuaded by defendant's argument that the statute only applied to objects that possessed greater weapon-like qualities than syringes. Within the prison setting, the element that transformed an unauthorized article into a weapon was its potential to cause injury, not the inmate's subjective intent. Defendant was not entitled to a hearing on whether he was sufficiently fluent in English to have knowingly waived his rights when he pleaded guilty. Defendant failed to move to withdraw his plea in the trial court, and the record showed that defendant had no problem communicating in English.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners held property on which they operated a horse stable and tack store. The landowners filed an application to re-zone their property as a general business zone so they could operate a harness horse racing track, but their application was denied. The landowner then filed an action to declare the zoning ordinance unconstitutional as applied to them. The trial court granted summary disposition to defendants, and the landowners appealed. On appeal the court held that 1) the trial court mistakenly intertwined the standards that apply to the different constitutional theories of relief because a substantive due process challenge was separate and distinct from a confiscation challenge to a zoning ordinance, 2) because the landowners did not allege that the zoning ordinance was confiscatory as applied to their property, they did not need to show that the classification precluded use of their land for any purposes to which it was reasonably adapted, and 3) the landowners' pleadings established a legal basis upon which relief could be granted and the claim was not so clearly unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual development could possibly justify a right to recover.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the grandmother's petition for custody, the probate court took temporary custody of the granddaughter pending an action to terminate the mother's parental rights. The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed the grandmother's petition. The court noted that the Child Custody Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.27 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.312(7)), did not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon a circuit court to entertain an original custody proceeding filed by the grandmother. Furthermore, the jurisdictional limitations of the Act did not allow the grandmother to create a child custody dispute by simply filing a complaint alleging that giving her custody was in the best interests of the child. Rather, before the grandmother could have initiated a custody dispute, the court held that there had to be a finding by the probate court of parental unfitness in the litigation concerning the child's permanent custody, and the temporary custody by the probate court was not sufficient to create a right to petition a circuit court for custody under the Act because there had been no testimony of neglect upon which the probate court could have entered a valid dispositional order.</SPAN></P>

In so holding, the court found that 1) the conduct prohibited by the internal police rule was not at all obscure or vague; 2) regulation of police secondary employment was within the constitutionally permissible scope of regulation; 3) the concern about a conflict of interest between the police officers' official duties and the operation of a private investigation business was sufficient to uphold the internal rule against an asserted due process deficiency; 4) the denial of the police officers' request for permission to become employed as private investigators did not lack a rational basis; and 5) the actual exercise of discretion as to these particular police officers was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial, agreeing with defendant that the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed him to be impeached by evidence of his prior convictions and that the error was not harmless. The court ruled that the breaking and entering, robberies, and CSC crimes were not signature crimes because they were not so nearly identical as to earmark the charged offense as the handiwork of defendant; therefore, the prior bad act testimony was not properly introduced to prove identity. The court also agreed with defendant that there was insufficient evidence that the victim was physically helpless because she was able to communicate unwillingness. Viewing the jury instruction as a whole to determine whether reversible error occurred, the court found that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that CSC was a specific intent crime, but that no manifest injustice resulted.

On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's order because &sect; 3 was constitutional and not overbroad or vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An attorney and a law clerk filed a lawsuit against state officials alleging that certain provisions of 1986 Mich. Pub. Acts 178, that being Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.1483 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.1483 et seq.), were unconstitutional. Their amended complaint alleged that they brought the action on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated within the forum state. Upon the lower court's dismissal of the show cause hearing, where an injunction against the enforcement of the provisions was sought, it stated that the attorney and the law clerk had no actual case or controversy. The court affirmed the judgment. The attorney had no standing to secure an adjudication of his clients' constitutional rights which they did not assert on their own behalf. To the extent that the attorney's claim rested on the constitutional right of his clients or other third parties, he was without standing to obtain declaratory relief pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 2.605(A). The economic injury claimed by the attorney because it was necessary to spend time counseling each new medical-malpractice client as to the provisions in question, did not create a justiciable actual controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) filed an action against defendant property owner under the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act (UCPA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.51 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8.265(1) et seq.). The property owner filed a counterclaim for damages. The Oakland County Circuit Court (Michigan) granted summary disposition in favor of MDOT on the counterclaim. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counterclaim sought to recover the fair market value of the property and lost profits or ground rents she could have earned between 1969 and the date of filing. She argued that she was entitled to additional damages because the property became vacant and undeveloped as a result of MDOT's impending condemnation for a freeway. The court affirmed summary disposition for MDOT. The court held that under the UCPA, a property owner cannot recover for injuries that were allegedly incurred prior to the established date of taking. The court stated that the property owner was required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.71 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 8.265(21) to raise challenges to the date of taking in a counterclaim. She ultimately chose not to contest the date of taking but, rather, to seek a recovery of pretaking lost profits as an element of just compensation, which was no more than the amount of compensation which would place her in as good a position as she would have been had no injury occurred. Compensating her for the taking on August 31, 1982, as well as for past events dating back to 1969, would have put her in a better position than she would have been had no taking occurred at all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment, which was entered in favor of the MDOT and against the property owner, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners argued that the decision to deny their variance request was arbitrary. The court rejected this argument and noted that it was proper for a zoning board of appeals to consider a requirement that the hardship not be self-created. The property owners then argued that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated their rights to substantive due process, equal protection and deprived them of their property without just compensation. The court rejected these arguments and affirmed the lower court's decision. The court noted that the property owners could not show that the ordinance did not advance a reasonable government interest or that the ordinance was unreasonable due to an arbitrary, capricious and unfounded exclusion of other types of legitimate land use from the area in question. The court also noted that the classification contained in the ordinance was reasonably related to the object of the ordinance and did not violate the property owners' right to equal protection. Finally, the property owners could not demonstrate that the ordinance restrictions precluded the use of their property for any purpose for which it was reasonably adapted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One co-defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court (Michigan), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of bank robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and possession of a firearm during a bank robbery. The second co-defendant appealed from his convictions for bank robbery, assault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm during a bank robbery, and possession of a firearm during an assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a deputy sheriff heard a radio call regarding a bank robbery by two black males, he purposely pulled over the first vehicle with black occupants even though it did not match the description of the getaway car. The driver got out and started shooting a gun at the deputy before driving off. The vehicle was stopped later with defendants, weapons, and the bank money inside. Defendants moved to suppress, claiming unconstitutional racial profiling. The motion was denied, as was one defendant's motion to sever. Defendants were convicted in a joint trial and they appealed. In affirming one defendant's convictions, the appellate court ruled that, based on the totality of the circumstances, although race was a criteria, the deputy had a particularized and objective basis for initiating the stop. Also, the prosecutor gave sufficient racially neutral reasons for striking three black persons from the jury. In reversing the other defendant's convictions, the appellate court ruled that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing the sever the trials because notice was given that there were antagonistic defenses, where the testimony of each defendant pitted him against the other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff estate challenged the trial court (Michigan) orders granting motions for summary disposition of defendants, hospital and doctors, in an action for medical malpractice arising from the treatment of the decedent. The estate asserted that the trial court erred in finding that an arbitration agreement was valid and binding and that it improperly placed the burden of disproving its validity on the estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate initiated an action for medical malpractice against the hospital and two doctors seeking to recover for the death of its decedent. The trial court granted the motions for summary judgment of the hospital and doctors on the grounds that the decedent was required by the terms of an arbitration agreement to first arbitrate any grievances arising from her medical treatment. The estate appealed asserting that the trial court erred in finding the arbitration agreement was valid and in placing the burden of proving its invalidity on the estate. The court affirmed, in part, holding that the trial court properly found that the arbitration agreement was valid and that the estate failed to meet its burden of rebutting the presumption of the agreement's validity. It also held that the arbitration agreement between the decedent and the hospital extended to the doctors as health care providers. The court reversed and remanded as to one doctor who failed to raise the arbitration agreement until two years after the filing of the estate's complaint. It held that he had waived the right to demand arbitration as grounds for dismissal under Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(7), (D)(2).</SPAN></P>

It reversed the summary judgment for one doctor and remanded to determine whether the two-year delay between his notification of the arbitration agreement in his responsive pleading and his motion for summary disposition based on the agreement constituted a common-law waiver of his right to arbitrate.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs argued on appeal that the board did not have constitutional or statutory authority to promulgate the ordinance. The court affirmed summary disposition in favor of the board. The court held that the enactment of the ordinance was within the constitutional and statutory authority given to the board to control and manage university property and to promote the objectives of the university pursuant to Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The next friend alleged that defendants acted in concert to exploit the basketball talents of a mentally incompetent basketball player and caused the player's mental breakdown. The trial court denied defendants' motions for summary judgment and granted the college's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, the court found that the next friend's cause of action arose during a period when the board of education could assert the defense of sovereign immunity and that managing high school sports was a part of the secondary education process, which was a governmental function entitled to sovereign immunity. Thus, the trial court erred in denying the board of education's and its employees' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed the grant of accelerated judgment to the college and reversed the denial of its president's motion for summary judgment because telephone calls into the state to recruit the basketball player did not satisfy the minimum contacts requirements for personal jurisdiction. Additionally, the basketball player suffered a mental breakdown, which was his injury, in another state, and there was no tort in the forum state.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 9.2325(1)(9)) (statute), which required medical personnel to perform the test on anyone involved in a car accident and turn over the results to the prosecutor, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The lower court granted their motions to suppress the results of blood tests that were performed when defendants were in the hospital after the car accidents and turned over to the prosecutor as required by the statute. The court affirmed, finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The statute violated the Fourth Amendment because it allowed a warrantless search and seizure prior to arrest and without consent in the absence of exigent circumstances. The requirement of express consent was not satisfied by mere use of the highways because the driver had a right to refuse the test. No exigency existed where the tests were performed for treatment and could have been obtained under a valid search warrant. The statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because different treatment of drivers who were taken to the hospital before their arrest and arrested drivers who were not taken to the hospital was not rationally based.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The limited partnership argued that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 339.1812, which prohibited a cemetery owner from owning or managing a funeral establishment, was unconstitutional as applied to it as a violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court affirmed the judgment for defendants, holding that the statute contained a rational relationship to legitimate governmental purposes. The statute did not involve either a fundamental interest or a suspect classification and was social and economic in nature. Therefore, the traditional equal protection test of whether there was a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation was applicable. The statute was constitutional because it promoted competition, protected consumers, preserved the professional aspects of funeral directing, and ensured public accountability of funeral professionals. The limited partnership failed to meet its burden of showing that either under any reasonable state of facts, the statute did not serve a legitimate governmental purpose or the classification did not bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers alleged that the minimum tax provision Michigan's Single Business Tax Act, Mich. Comp.

The court held that the minimum tax was computed as a direct measure of gross receipts and was therefore preempted by 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1513(a). The court held that the taxpayers should not be assessed on their tax base apportioned to Michigan without regard to the phase-in discount because the discount was not identical to the concept of a minimum tax, and the two concepts could be logically severed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that (1) defendant was not denied his right to compulsory process by the trial court's refusal to compel certain out-of-state witnesses to attend the trial because defendant failed to make out a prima facie case that the testimony of the individuals was material; (2) although the trial court erred by permitting the prosecutor to elicit defendant's opinion during cross-examination that certain prosecution witnesses were &quot;liars,&quot; the error was harmless; and (3) the trial court properly denied a dismissal of the charges against defendant on the grounds of excessive pre-arrest delay.

The trial court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the department and the tribunal. On appeal, the court affirmed.

The parents claimed the exception violated federal and state equal protection and due process principles. On appeal, the court held that the Michigan Constitution secured the same rights of equal protection (Mich. Const. art 1, &sect; 2 (1963)) and due process (Mich.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was an out-of-state corporation that maintained an office in Michigan for purposes of soliciting business in the state. It was subject to the SBTA, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.558(1) et seq.), which imposed a tax upon the privilege of doing business in Michigan. The taxpayer brought an action against the state claiming that it was entitled to a refund for overpaid taxes. The lower court granted the taxpayer's motion for summary disposition and ordered the state to refund any overpayment. The state appealed, and the court reversed. The court found that the lower court's decision was based on a case that approved a two-step method for apportioning the taxpayer's business activity in Michigan. The court stated that that method had been explicitly rejected by the legislature, which subsequently amended the SBTA to state the tests used to determine whether an apportionment formula fairly represented a taxpayer's business activity in Michigan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court (Michigan) remanded, ordering the court to consider the rationale employed by the Detroit Recorder's Court in its decision to reverse in part the trial court's judgment and remand for trial defendant's charges for failure to limit storage of fireworks to an amount under 100 pounds, failure to allow a fire official to perform and complete inspections and refusing entry of an authorized representative for making lawful inspection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three misdemeanor violations: (1) failure to limit storage of fireworks to an amount under 100 pounds, Detroit Ordinances &sect; 19-3-70, failure to allow a fire official to perform and complete inspections of the premises contrary to Detroit Ordinances &sect; 19-3-19(h)(5), and refusing entry of a duly authorized city representative for the purpose of making lawful inspection contrary to Detroit Ordinances &sect; 31-1-9. He argued that the ordinances were unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed all counts. On appeal, the Recorder's Court remanded the case for trial the storage of excess fireworks charge. The court affirmed, and defendant appealed to the supreme court. The supreme court remanded to the court. The court reversed, finding the Recorder's Court's decision to reverse in part the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for trial was infirm. The court concluded that defendant established that the fireworks ordinance was not rationally related to the city's objective of protecting the safety, health, and welfare of its residents, and did not represent an exercise of the city's police power within the ambit of due process and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

On cross-examination, the complainant acknowledged that, at the time of the incident, she told police that she was forced into the van by defendant, while at the preliminary examination she testified that she willingly went with defendant. Defendant filed a motion to introduce evidence of the complainant's past sexual conduct as a prostitute. The court granted the motion and the prosecution was granted leave to appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that precedent indicated a willingness to allow evidence that a victim was a prostitute when the defense was consent and a proper showing was made. In this case, the court concluded that evidence of the victim's prior sexual activity was absolutely critical in ensuring defendant a fair trial and in preserving his confrontation right. Without this evidence, the court noted that defendant would be precluded from presenting his defense of consent.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 600.555, and which severed the words &quot;and longevity payments&quot; from 1985 Mich. Pub. Acts 104, &sect; 17(5)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County provided longevity pay to probate and circuit judges, at-large elected county officials and all county employees with some exceptions. After the judge completed 19 years of service, he was eligible for a two percent increase in longevity pay. The County refused to pay the increase because the increase would cause the judge's salary to be in excess of 92 percent of the salary of a Michigan supreme court justice, and as a result, the County would lose its partial reimbursement from the State. The judge filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of whether longevity pay was additional salary under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.555. On appeal, the court held that because &sect; 600.555 was silent as to longevity pay, the legislature did not intend longevity pay to be treated as additional salary. Moreover, the court found that longevity pay was in the nature of a fringe benefit based upon the judge's length of service. The court also upheld the circuit court's severance of the words &quot;and longevity payments&quot; from 1985 Mich. Pub.

The township filed a petition to have the landowner remove the mobile home. A modified order permitted the mobile home to stay for a maximum of six months and imposed fines for contempt.

Plaintiff, a member insurer, had filed an action alleging that the premiums were arbitrary and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association was created under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3104 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13104) to indemnify insurance companies for catastrophic claims or for certain losses under personal protection insurance. Insurers writing no-fault automobile insurance were required to be members of the association, which assessed premiums therefor. The insurer alleged that the premiums were arbitrary and unreasonable and that &sect; 500.3104&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated power and violated the title-object rule. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's holding that the association was a state agency, and its plan of operation had no effect, and found that: (1) applying the Constitutionality test, the association's character and function revealed that it was a state agency under the APA; (2) to be effective, its plan of operation had to be repromulgated as a rule; (3) under a three part-test, &sect; 500.3104 was a constitutional delegation of power to the association; and (4) &sect; 500.3104 did not violate the title-object rule because its purpose of indemnifying insurers for certain losses was germane to its object of providing protection for policyholders and claimants of unsound insurers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants who ran a pyramid scheme filed motions to suppress and to dismiss which were denied by the trial court. On appeal, the appellate court found government had probable cause to charge defendants with violation of the pyramid promotion act, Mich. Comp.

Scheme was an investment contract regulated under securities law because profits were to be derived solely from the efforts of others. The pyramid promotion act was not constitutionally vague because it gave persons of ordinary intelligence notice of the conduct that would make them criminally liable, probable cause existed, and defendants were not denied their right to a speedy trial because delays caused by the court should be given minimal weight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff family members filed suit in the Ingham Circuit Court (Michigan) against defendant vehicle owner, driver, and passengers after a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff appealed as of right from a final order of summary disposition under Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(8) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted. Plaintiffs also appealed the summary disposition pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(10) for one claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver and passengers were negotiating the purchase of the motorhome, and took it on a trip to a concert in another city. After the concert and two hours of visiting a friend, the passengers agreed that the driver, who had consumed a part of a one-half pint bottle of peppermint schnapps and one valium pill, was to take them home. Two of the passengers stayed awake for about 20 minutes to determine that the driver was capable. The driver fell asleep at the wheel and lost control of the motorhome, crashing into plaintiffs' vehicle which was parked on the shoulder of the road. Acknowledging the joint enterprise theory had not previously been used to establish the liability of passengers in another vehicle, the court ruled that plaintiffs' complaint did state a claim upon which relief could have been granted and it could not have said that the claim was so clearly unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual development could possibly have justified a right to recover. The court added that the ruling under Mich. Ct. R. 2.116(C)(10) that one plaintiff did not sustain sufficient injury for a claim was returned so that the trial court had an opportunity to apply a new standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a decision by the Court of Claims (Michigan), which affirmed a ruling by defendant Michigan Department of Treasury that denied the taxpayer's request for a refund of a single business tax under the Michigan Single Business Tax Act (SBTA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1 et seq. (1975 repealed) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.558(1) (1975 repealed)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1983, the taxpayer sought a refund of taxes it had paid for tax years 1976-81 pursuant to the Michigan Single Business Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1 et seq. (1975 repealed) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.558(1) et seq.

Laws &sect; 208.97 (1975 repealed) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.558(97) (1975 repealed)).

The taxpayer and others had commenced earlier litigation challenging the department's application of the SBTA apportionment provisions in computing their tax bases, and that litigation served to toll the statute of limitations for pursuing refunds for the 1976-77 tax years. Because the taxpayer filed its amended returns for 1977-77 before the final determination of that litigation, those amended returns were timely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a developer, owned lots in a proposed single-family residential subdivision. The entire thrust of the taxpayer's argument was that the lots should be taxed as a whole rather than as 100 individual units in order to judge fairly the property's fair market value. The township, however, desired to have the lots be valued on an individual lot basis. The Tribunal agreed with the township as to the value of the lots, valued individually. However, the Tribunal went on to discount that value by a factor of 18 percent, which it considered as holding costs during the marketing period. In partially reversing the judgment under review, the court found that the Tribunal properly selected the market approach as the most accurate method of determining the lots' value. However, the Tribunal erred in interpreting the statutory phrase &quot;true cash value&quot; when it measured the fair market value of the taxpayer's property on a &quot;wholesale&quot; basis where the taxpayer did not, in fact, market the property in that fashion. Moreover, the discounting also was in error, particularly where the taxpayer likely had derived or would derive an income tax benefit from many of the holding costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governmental unit rejected a development plan proposed by the landowner because it did not comply with the governmental unit's zoning ordinances, which regulated the building of structures near the shoreline and also regulated the amount of dock space that could be installed. The landowner claimed that zoning ordinance was unconstitutional because it was not authorized by the Township Rural Zoning Act, Mich. Comp. Laws. &sect; 125.271 et seq. The court agreed with the landowner and reversed the trial court. The court pointed out that the governmental unit had no police power of its own. The court applied all the applicable statutory construction rules and concluded that any zoning power the governmental unit had came from the Township Rural Zoning Act. The court noted that the language of the enabling statute clearly limited the governmental unit to the regulation of land development and did not extend to the regulation of the riparian rights of a landowner. Thus, the trial court erred when it concluded that the zoning ordinance was valid.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 257.254 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.1954). Defendant appealed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant bought a car from a third party. The certificate of title contained a forged discharge of a lien. The seller testified for the state in return for a reduced charge that arose out of the same transaction. Defendant's trial theory was that the seller, anticipating receiving $ 8,000 in cash for the car failed to pay off the outstanding balance to his lender and instead either personally or through an accomplice falsified the discharge on the face of the title before delivering the title to defendant. The trial court sustained the prosecutor's objection to defendant's cross-examination of the seller regarding his financial situation and on his intent to file for bankruptcy. In reversing defendant's conviction, the court held that the foreclosure of testimony concerning the seller's financial status denied defendant his right to confrontation. The court observed that the inquiry on cross-examination was about a temporary or unusual shortage of funds that might have caused an otherwise gainfully employed person, the seller, to resort to an economic crime. The error was not harmless because seller's testimony was the only evidence against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for making a false application for an automobile title was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, 42 foreign insurers, had filed 123 complaints in which they sought premium tax refunds of $ 255 million that they had paid under &sect; 440 of the Insurance Code of 1956, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.100 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.1100 et seq.).</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 7.558(1) et seq.) required foreign insurers to pay premium taxes as a condition of doing business in Michigan, while domestic insurers paid a single business tax. Plaintiffs alleged that the two tax systems imposed a greater tax burden on foreign insurers and that the premium tax violated the Equal Protection Clause and Mich. Const. art 1, &sect; 2 (1963). The lower court denied the department's motion for summary disposition. On appeal, the department contended that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.558(1) et seq.) established a reliable source of insurance coverage and increased the availability of insurance in less profitable areas where public need was greatest. Plaintiffs contended that the tax accomplished its purpose only by discriminating against nonresident competitors. The court reversed and applied its holding prospectively only. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 208.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.558(1) et seq.) was unconstitutional because the classification scheme was not rationally related to the purpose. A foreign insurer could not obtain a tax preference even if it offered insurance in less profitable areas.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that cocaine seized from defendant's car was admissible. Although the affidavit supporting the search warrant for the car was not intentionally false, the affidavit was sufficient even without the challenged statements to support the warrant. The court then held that while the state's remarks in closing argument attacking the professionalism of defendant's medical expert were improper, reversal was not required because any prejudicial effect could have been eliminated with a curative instruction if one had been requested. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on possession of a lesser amount of cocaine because such offense was a cognate offense and not a lesser-included offense.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the standard to be applied in construing the meaning of gross indecency was a common sense standard. The court noted that under other similar gross indecency statutes, acts of touching and even acts of intercourse had been held not to be grossly indecent acts. Since the court, following the common sense of society test, had consistently applied the gross indecency statute at issue and the other gross indecency statutes to cases involving oral sexual acts, the court ruled that the statute did not apply to the fact situation in this case, which involved defendant's touching of another's genital area over clothing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged decisions of the Oakland Circuit Court (Michigan) which affirmed an order of dismissal by the district court of charges against defendant for violating the ticket scalping statute,&nbsp;Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with ticket scalping for selling baseball tickets for more than the face value without the permission of the ball club. His trial ended in a hung jury and the district court granted his motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that the ticket scalping statute was unconstitutional. The circuit court affirmed, but this court reversed. It found that the legislature had the authority to regulate ticket scalping to serve a public purpose and that the statute clearly defined the offense as the reselling of tickets to a public event for a premium at a place other than the box office if one did not have the written permission of the owner or promoter. Further, the statute did not allow a private concern to arbitrarily elect to make defendant's acts criminal, as it was not the ball club that decided whether defendant was in violation of the statute. It only decided if defendant would be allowed to sell tickets at a premium. If the ball club declined the request to sell the tickets in such manner, it was defendant who determined whether or not he would abide by the determination or whether he would violate the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The multifamily property owners claimed that a city ordinance that required only property owners who owned more than two units pay a refuse collection fee violated the equal protection clauses of the Michigan and United States Constitutions. The trial court found in their favor. On appeal the court reversed. The court held that the city could consider the relative tax contributions of all users of its refuse collection service in imposing the fee because it was reasonably related to its goal of a more equitable allocation of the cost of the service. In terms of property tax contributions, the court noted that multifamily dwellings had consistently paid a disproportionately small share of the cost of refuse collection. In addition, even if the fees collected were added to the tax contribution, the total payment still did not cover the cost of the refuse collection service provided to them. The court also held that because the revenue generated by the city refuse collection fee did not appear to have ever exceeded the cost of the service rendered to multifamily dwellings, the trial court erred in construing the fee to be a tax passed illegally under the guise of a regulatory measure.</SPAN></P>

The teacher filed an action under the Civil Rights Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 37.2101 et seq; Mich. Stat. Ann. 3.548(201)(a), and the school filed a motion for an accelerated judgment on the grounds that it was not an employer under the Act and that the Act was unconstitutional as applied in violation of the Free Exercise and Establishment Clause rights of U.S. Const. amend. I. The school appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that the school qualified as an employer under the clear language of the statute because there were no relevant express exemptions for church-affiliated schools. The court found that the school had failed to avail itself of its right to apply for an exemption from the statute on the basis that its religious beliefs constituted a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to its normal operation. The court found no excessive entanglement between religion and government or that the school's burden outweighed the state's interest in eliminating sex discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judges represented a class of present and former judges who had retired or were planning to retire. The dispute was whether defendants were properly interpreting the statutory term &quot;final average compensation figure&quot; to mean the same as the term &quot;average final compensation&quot; used in the county retirement formula. The court found that it was. The court noted that defendants were not reducing retirement benefits paid out prior to the effective date of the amendments. Defendants were simply computing retirement benefits payable after September 1, 1981, on the basis of a new formula expressly devised by the legislature. Thus, they were properly construing and applying &sect;&sect; 14a and 14 c of the Judges' Retirement Act. Since &sect;&sect; 14a and 14c were both in effect, the retired named plaintiffs were without any vested contract rights to county retirement benefits computed under the old formula. Given plaintiffs' apparent admission that county retirement benefits would continue to be computed in part on the basis of accumulated employee contributions, the court declined to remand this case for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Public Service Commission approved incorporation of a gas cost recovery clause into the rate schedules. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Reading the gas cost recovery statute as a whole, the court held that it met the requirement that it provide standards as reasonably precise as the subject matter required or permitted. There was no improper delegation of power to the Commission from the legislature with respect to the establishment and implementation of the gas cost recovery clause. The allowance for an exemption to the gas cost recovery clause was reasonable since application of the clause to all classes of customers could result in inducing large industrial customers with dual fuel capability to switch from gas power to an alternative fuel to the detriment of all other classes. The interpretation of &quot;reasonable and prudent&quot; in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.6h by the Commission, that these two words did not make past and present tense distinctions and could be read together as a phrase, was not contrary to the ordinary and common meaning of the words, and gave effect to the legislative intent.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review and contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements made as a result of his unconstitutional arrest. The court found that when defendant was taken into custody by the police acting without a warrant, the detention was illegal unless the police had probable cause to arrest defendant. The court determined that probable cause existed when the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge were sufficient to a prudent person to believe that defendant had committed or was committing a felony. The court found that, because the police lacked probable cause to arrest defendant, the evidence obtained as a result of that unlawful detention and any statements made while unlawfully detained were to be suppressed. The court held that the trial court was clearly erroneous in failing to grant defendant's motion to suppress. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner possessed one and one-half lots of property. Those lots measured 137 feet in depth and 60 feet in width at the rear. However, the landowner's frontage on a particular street measured only 35 feet. He was denied a building permit because the proposed site did not comply with the village's setback requirements. The board upheld that decision. The landowner sought judicial review. The trial court granted the village's motion for summary disposition. The landowner appealed from that order, which was reversed. The court entered summary disposition in favor of the landowner. Michiana, Mich., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 1(7) established 50 feet as the minimum width at the front setback line. Furthermore, Michiana, Mich., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 2(3) specified a minimum set back distance of 20 feet from the street line. The court rejected the village's contention that the front setback line referenced in &sect; 1(7) was exactly 20 feet from the street line. Rather, setback referred to the distance between the street line and the front building line.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of receiving and concealing stolen property, defendant sought review. On appeal, defendant alleged that the depiction of his good character and truthfulness were destroyed by the admission of a letter he had written to a friend. The letter asked the friend to put pressure on the recipient of the stolen merchandise to change his story so as not to implicate defendant. At the close of the evidence, defendant's attorney sought a mistrial, arguing that he had made an informal discovery agreement with the state and that the state had never disclosed the existence of the letter. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that while the state violated the agreement, the trial court properly inquired whether there might be any other witnesses that defendant would have called. The court agreed that if there had been any error on the part of the state, it was harmless and that although the letter was very damaging to the defense, it was admissible evidence to which no objection other than nondisclosure could be made. The court further held that the trial court had discretion to deal with questions of noncompliance with discovery orders or agreements.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the search was unreasonable where the arresting officers had no reason to believe that plaintiff was armed and dangerous, that plaintiff had any contraband on her person, and where plaintiff was suspected of a nonviolent offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the court considered the issue of whether Detroit, Mich., Ordinance No. 556-H unconstitutionally deprived property owners of their property interests without due process of law or just compensation. Overruling the city's declaration that the ordinance was a valid exercise of its powers of eminent domain, the court found that the ordinance represented an exercise of the city's police powers and did not deprive owners of a property interest within the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court held that the ordinance did not transfer title of properties to the city, but in response to the nuisance of abandoned property, the ordinance was authorized to allow third parties to enter, occupy, and repair a vacant home which had been declared to be a nuisance. At the end of that abatement period, the city acquired title to the properties through prescribed judicial proceedings so that it could sell the property to the nuisance abatement contractor. The foregoing circumstances, along with the continuous notice to the property owner at each stage of the abatement process, rendered the ordinance a reasonable exercise of the city's police powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer claimed that the WCAB misapplied the applicable legal standards when it concluded that the employee suffered a work-related lung condition. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the judgment. In light of the unambiguous language of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.821(2), the court believed that the referee could only order the insurer to pay its proportionate share of attorney fees, but not costs. The employee representatives were, by definition, aligned and identified with employee interests. Even though the employee representative did not constitute a majority of the WCAB panel but, in fact, was only one-half of it, the employer was nonetheless denied its right to a fair and impartial hearing because it had to be presumed that the employee representative was already aligned with the employee's position. The fact that an employer representative would be added to the panel in the event of a tie vote between one member already aligned with the employee and a neutral member was insufficient to overcome the initial partiality inherent in the original two-member WCAB panel.</SPAN></P>

In reversing the trial court's dismissal of the charges, the court held defendants relinquished any claimed right to martial privacy by the overtly public conditions under which they performed the sexual act and that the State had a legitimate interest in regulating the behavior. Thus, the court held that &sect; 750.338b,as applied to the narrow facts in the case, was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court held that the NRC was without concurrent or exclusive authority to establish a mourning dove hunting season.

Ann. &sect; 13.1211) (game law), authorized the NRC to regulate the taking or killing of game birds, and because the Hunting and Fishing License Act (license act), 1980 Mich. Pub. Acts 86, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 316.101 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.1350(101) et seq.), defined doves as game birds, the NRC had authority to establish the hunting season. However, the court held that the game law left the power to declare an open hunting season with the legislature and allowed the NRC to establish the time, manner, and bag limits of the hunt. The court refused to read the two statutes in pari materia because their purposes were very different. The game law determined what animals and birds could be hunted, and the license act was concerned with licensing those who hunted them. Finally, the court noted that the DNR had construed the statutes in the same way for a long time. That construction was entitled to great weight.</SPAN></P>

Because the tribunal had not expressly been given the power to hear class actions, such a power could not be extended by implication. The tribunal did, however, have authority to dismiss a petition for noncompliance with a rule of the tribunal. There was, therefore, no abuse of discretion in dismissing the class action.

On appeal, the court affirmed that portion of the trial court's order dismissing the representative's existing pleadings, but reversed that portion of the trial court's order denying the representative's motion for leave to amend his complaint. The court held that the trial court should have permitted additional discovery and amendments of pleadings in order to show any exceptions to the governmental immunity, which were not required to have been pleaded at the time the representative filed the complaint but became necessary after a subsequent court decision.

Ct. R. 2.116(C)(10). The parties had been litigating the matter since 1974, when the insured brought suit against the insurer on the ground that the property protection provisions of the Michigan no-fault act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 500.3121 et seq., were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A refinery truck driver had just unloaded his tank at a casting plant of the insured. Approximately one half hour later, an explosion occurred at the unloading area. The insured made a claim for property protection benefits with the insurer. The trial court had granted the insurer summary judgment because the no-fault act did not make the insurer liable for property damage because there was no direct causal relationship between the truck and the property damage and that the property damage did not arise out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle as required under the no-fault act. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the insurer. The court held that the explosion and subsequent property damage were not reasonably identifiable with the use of the tank truck as a motor vehicle; rather, it was a fortuitous occurrence, caused by an intervening independent act. The court further found that there was no reason to believe that the legislature intended the no-fault act to provide coverage to the insured as a property owner under the circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, by leave granted, from a decision of the Recorder's Court of Detroit (Michigan) to remand the case for trial on the first count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city fire inspector went to defendant's retail outlet and observed a quantity of fireworks in excess of the allowable amount prescribed in the City of Detroit Fire Prevention Code, Detroit, Mich., Ordinances &sect; 23-4-9.2. As a result of that visit and a subsequent one, defendant was charged with violations of &sect;&sect; 23-4-9, 2-1-3.4, 31-1-9. The district court dismissed all three counts, the recorder's court remanded the case for trial on count one, and the court affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a mental health worker, was kicked in the head by a patient while on the job. During an initial period of absence, she received assault pay benefits pursuant to her collective bargaining agreement and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 330.1113 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.800(113)). The employee returned to work but had a second period of absence, during which time she was denied assault pay benefits. The employee's union grievance was denied in an arbitration award for lack of causal link between her current medical condition and the assault. The trial court granted summary disposition to the department, and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court correctly determined that the arbitration award barred subsequent litigation of the employee's claim for assault pay. The court found that the statute was substantially merged with the assault pay provision of the employee's collective bargaining agreement and that the arbitrator was empowered to make determinations on both the statute and the contract. Because there was no question of statutory construction in this case, arbitration was an appropriate, exclusive, and final forum for resolution of the employee's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police, investigating a reported break in, saw two men carrying items out of a house, and chased them when the men ran. The officer shot the suspect in the neck, causing severe injury. The suspect prevailed on his theory that the officer's use of deadly force was unnecessary under the circumstances. The officer sought review. The court affirmed the award. The officer argued that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on the suspect's duty to refrain from fleeing. The court held that whether the suspect had such duty was irrelevant in determining whether the officer used unnecessary force against the suspect. The court also rejected the argument that improper conduct by the suspect's counsel prejudiced the officer, finding that the trial court properly instructed the jury that counsel's statements were not evidence. The court reversed and remanded the directed verdict for the city because police regulations permitted an officer to use deadly force in pursuit of a burglary suspect, and the validity of such regulation was questionable in light of Supreme Court jurisprudence holding that use of deadly force in such circumstances constituted an unlawful seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which convicted him of being a sexually delinquent person under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 768.35 after he pleaded guilty to indecent exposure in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.335a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the sexual delinquency statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.10a, punished him for his status as a sexual offender and that any punishment imposed because of that status was cruel and unusual punishment. He also claimed that &sect; 750.10a was unconstitutionally vague and vested unstructured discretion in the trier of fact to determine whether a crime had been committed. The court held &sect; 750.10a did not provide for cruel and unusual punishment. Enhancing defendant's sentence because he was a sexual delinquent punished him for his acts and not for his status. Defendant lacked standing to claim that &sect; 750.10a was vague. He could not say that he was not forewarned that his acts were prohibited because evidence introduced at his trial included testimony of numerous instances and convictions similar crimes. The trial court improperly instructed the jury only that any person whose sexual behavior was characterized by repetitive and compulsive acts was guilty of being a sexually delinquent person. That standard left the jury free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what was and what was not prohibited on a case-by-case basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for being a sexually delinquent person and remanded the case for a new trial or, in the alternative, to permit the prosecutor, at his option, to dismiss the sexual delinquency charge and allow defendant to be resentenced on the underlying indecent exposure guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, a husband and wife, were Michigan residents. The husband worked in Belgium for several months and paid income taxes to the Belgium government. The taxpayers contended that they were entitled to credit their state return under &sect; 255 by the taxes paid in Belgium. They also argued that if a credit was denied, the retroactive application of &sect; 255 was unconstitutional, and that it violated equal protection principles. In affirming the judgment for the treasury department, the court held that (1) the Legislature did not intend by enacting or amending &sect; 255 that taxpayers, who paid for income taxes to any foreign country, except Canada, would be entitled to a foreign tax credit, (2) the retroactive application of &sect; 255 was not unconstitutional because the taxpayers did not have a vested right to any tax credit, and (3) the provision under &sect; 255 of a tax credit for Canadian provincial taxes paid, but not for taxes paid to other foreign governments, did not violate equal protection guarantees, because the provisions of &sect; 255 were rationally related to the legitimate state interest of providing equal tax treatment to all income earned outside the State of Michigan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the stepfather filed their adoption petition four years after the father was incarcerated in Alabama. The father was served with process in prison and he requested an adjournment so he could obtain counsel. The probate court granted the adjournment, but the father was absent and not represented by counsel at the final termination hearing. The court reversed the probate court's order terminating the father's parental rights. The probate court erred in failing to exercise its discretion to appoint an attorney for the father. Although the father never formally requested appointed counsel, the probate court was aware that the father desired an attorney and lacked funds to pay for one. Further, due to the father's incarceration and inability to appear before the probate court, the father's communications to the probate should have been considered a request for the appointment of counsel. The father was also entitled to an attorney based on the complexities of the case, which were recognized by the probate court.</SPAN></P>

However, plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C.S.&sect; 1983 claim was never specifically adjudicated. A related claim for declaratory and injunctive relief was resolved in plaintiffs' favor before plaintiffs amended their complaint to plead the civil rights claim. Plaintiffs asserted that they should be deemed prevailing parties on their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim and awarded attorney fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The order was affirmed because the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim was added after plaintiffs had attained their desired result and therefore, plaintiffs did not prevail on their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim for the purposes of their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prosecutor sought superintending control to review the action taken by a judge of the trial court (Michigan) in sentencing a convicted criminal to a three-year probationary term, with 20 weekends to be served in a county jail pursuant to the criminal's plea-based conviction of operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor, third offense, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge sentenced the criminal to a three-year probationary term with 20 weekends to be served in jail. The prosecutor sought superintending control on the ground that the sentence was illegal. The court granted superintending control and vacated the sentence, holding that the judge did not have discretion to impose a probationary sentence without a fine on a person convicted of a felony under the Michigan Vehicle Code. The court noted that &sect; 902 of the Code, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.902, provided that a person convicted of a felony under the Code was to be punished by imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than five years, or by a fine of not less than $ 500 nor more than $ 5000, or by both fine and imprisonment. The court found that the probationary sentence imposed by the judge required the criminal to pay court costs but made no provision for a fine. The court noted that the Michigan Code of Criminal Procedure, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 771.1(1), permitted the imposition of probation. The court concluded that the Vehicle Code provision controlled because it was special and particular whereas the Code of Criminal Procedure was a general act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order from the trial court (Michigan), which convicted him of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance (marijuana), two counts of delivery of a controlled substance (marijuana), and possession of cocaine. He contended that the trial court erred in denying his motions to quash an agent's information and to suppress physical evidence obtained pursuant to an unsigned search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's delivery convictions arose out of two controlled buys initiated by an agent working for the police department. The possession convictions arose out of evidence discovered during a search of defendant's home. Defendant was convicted for possession and delivery of a controlled substance. On appeal, the court affirmed the delivery conviction but reversed the possession conviction. The court found that defendant had failed to meet his burden of proving that he had been entrapped through police exploitation of an alleged friendship with the agent; in fact the agent's testimony indicated that the two were not friends and that the agent did not know defendant personally. The court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence that formed the basis of his possession conviction because the search warrant had not been signed by the magistrate. The court held that a search and seizure that took place pursuant to an unsigned warrant was unconstitutional. Thus the evidence seized during the search should have been suppressed. Because that evidence formed the basis of the possession conviction, the court reversed that conviction.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner contended that the trial court's interjection of an objection to the prisoner's parole was unconstitutional because the parole system was an executive function. On appeal, the court held that the parole procedure vested a limited, intermediate function in the trial court to temporarily veto the granting of parole in a limited category of cases, subject to the final power of the governor as the chief executive officer to release by pardon or commutation of sentence. The court found that the chief executive officer, in his discretion, always retained power to release a prisoner. The court affirmed and held that the governor had the final decision as to release, pursuant to the constitutional mandate of Mich. Const. art 5, &sect; 14 (1963). The court held that Mich. Comp.

In fact, the court held that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the classifications in the ordinance were rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and further found that the citizen could not possibly overcome the presumption of the constitutional validity of the ordinance at trial. The trial judge erred in finding that the ordinance authorized an unreasonable search, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV and U.S. Const. art 1, &sect; 11.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a postconviction proceeding, defendant appealed his conviction by the trial court (Michigan) for larceny in a building, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.360. He argued that the conviction violated his constitutional rights because he was not tried and convicted of the offense. In the original case, he had been convicted of breaking and entering an occupied building with intent to commit larceny, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.110.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first appeal, this court reversed and remanded for entry of the larceny offense with an option to retry on the charged offense. Defendant had also pled guilty to being a third offender. The State chose not to retry defendant and entered the larceny conviction. It argued that the trial court was allowed to enter a conviction on a lesser-included offense instead of granting a new trial. In the second appeal, the court found that the law of the case did not control because different questions of law were presented in the two appeals. The constitutional issue before the court was whether defendant's rights were violated by entry of a conviction on a cognate offense with different elements when the jury did not necessarily determine his guilt on the different elements. This was a case of first impression to the court. However, the court's decision was determined by prior precedent of the Michigan Supreme Court, which had remanded cases for entry of a conviction on a cognate lesser-included offense, with an option for the State to retry defendant on a higher offense. The court affirmed because it found that the trial court had followed the express remand directions of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers, car dealerships, sought review of the decision of the Court of Claims (Michigan) that granted defendant Michigan Department of Treasury's motion for summary judgment, brought pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 116(C)(8), and dismissed the taxpayers' complaint, which claimed that Michigan's Single Business Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 208.1 et seq., was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers argued that the Act contravened the Michigan Constitution because it imposed a tax upon the exercise of a fundamental constitutional right, it effectively imposed a graduated income tax contrary to Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 7 (1963), and it imposed a double income tax on certain Michigan taxpayers in contravention of the uniformity requirement of Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 3 (1963). The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the Act was a proper exercise of the State's taxing powers and did not contravene the constitution. The court reasoned that the right or privilege of engaging in business was an important aspect of liberty but was not a fundamental right. As such, the court opined that business and occupations could be regulated and taxed. The court noted that the single business tax was not an income tax and, therefore, was not governed by Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 7 (1963), which prohibited a graduated income tax. Similarly, finding that the single business tax operated uniformly upon all persons engaged in business activities in the State, the court concluded that it complied with the uniformity requirement of Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 3 (1963).</SPAN></P>

The city filed a motion for its actual costs 55 days after the court's affirmance. The court denied the motion as untimely and denied the city's motion for reconsideration and clarification.

The Department of Treasury (department) immediately issued jeopardy sales tax assessments based on drug records seized.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision as to the department's claim and reversed the grant of summary judgment as to the inmate's civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court held that the inmate had no tenable position as a matter of law so as to justify a right of recovery under &sect; 1983. It was not error for the trial court to grant summary judgment on the inmate's counterclaim that the General Sales Tax Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.51 et seq. (Mich. Stat.

Defendant was convicted of knowingly making false statements of material facts in his application for a certificate title. Defendant appealed.

The court held that the appraisal provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 487.430(2)(b) (Mich. Comp. Stat. &sect; 23.710(130)(2)(b)) did not violate the judicial review provisions of Mich.

The court reversed that portion of the order exempting the pre-school's compliance with certain licensing requirements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Teacher used physical force to escort student to principal's office. Principal detained student in his office for a period of time. Principal released student in time for student to attend his next scheduled class. Student and his parents initiated an action against school district, teacher, and principal. Student and parents sought review of the trial court's adverse rulings. In affirming, the court found no error in the trial court's dismissal of the civil rights count. In addition, the court found that Michigan's corporal punishment statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 380.1312, was not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the laws. Based on its review of the record, the court found no evidence that teacher's use of force was unprovoked or unreasonable. Thus, the court found that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. With regard to claims against school district and principal for negligent hiring and supervision and false imprisonment, respectively, the court held that the doctrine of governmental immunity foreclosed such causes of action. Lastly, the court held that there was no cause of action against teacher for false imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the mayor argued that the recall provisions of the Michigan Election Law, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 168.951 et seq., were void. The court stated that the fact that the recall election had already taken place did not preclude its review of the appeal. The general rule was that absent constitutional or statutory requirements, the sufficiency of reasons in a recall petition was for the determination of the electorate rather than the courts. The Michigan Constitution and the election statutes required a clear statement of reasons for recall based upon an act or acts in the course of conduct in office of the officer whose recall was sought. Beyond this, the Constitution reserved the power of recall to the people. The reasons set forth in a recall petition had to be stated with adequate clarity. Although the court concluded that the trial court erred in ruling that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 168.952 was unconstitutional, the court affirmed the denial of the injunctive relief and the dismissal of the mayor's action. The court held that the unconstitutional provision was severable from the remainder of the recall statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealership claimed that other merchants located near its business, including motor home and motorcycle dealers, were allowed to sell their products on Sunday, while it was prohibited by statute. The dealership filed a complaint seeking a judgment declaring Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 435.251&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court determined that the statute was constitutional and refused to strike it down. On appeal, the dealership argued that there was no reasonable relationship between the remedy of prohibiting the sale of automobiles on Sunday and any alleged public purpose to be served by the statute. Defendant, as the prosecutor, asserted that the law should be enforced as it stood. The court found that although the legislature had repealed most other &quot;Sunday&quot; laws, the legislature was not required to deal with every aspect of a problem at the same time. Under the applicable constitutional tests, the classification in question violated neither due process nor equal protection guarantees. The classification, while it could appear harsh to automobile dealers, affected all members of that class equally and was not arbitrary as it stood.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 330.1804 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.800(804)). The wife cross-appealed, inter alia, issues of equal protection and the right to jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After her husband was involuntarily committed, the department made an administrative determination of the wife's financial liability for his care, as provided by &sect; 804. Although a hearing officer reduced the amount of liability, the wife appealed to the probate court. Meanwhile, her husband died. The probate court remanded for recalculation of liability, but both parties appealed to the circuit court, which upheld the remand, but ruled also that the wife's separate property was protected from consideration. On further review, the court ruled that the married woman's property provision of Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1, did not preclude consideration of the wife's separate property. The provisions of &sect; 804 did not impose a disability of coverture, but treated both spouses equally, imposing joint and several liability for the other's mental health costs. The wife's equal protection rights were not violated because it was reasonable to treat parental and spousal liability differently under &sect; 804. She was not entitled to a jury trial in an appeal from an administrative decision and, although review was confined to the record, she waived her right to supplement that record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state treasurer filed an action on behalf of the Michigan Department of Corrections against appellee inmate pursuant to the former Prison Reimbursement Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 800.401 et seq. A circuit court held that the Act was unconstitutional, and the court affirmed on equal protection grounds. The Michigan Supreme Court reversed and remanded the cause back to the court for further consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action sought to require the inmate to reimburse the State for costs arising out of his incarceration. The inmate responded by challenging the constitutionality of the Act. The circuit court sustained the inmate's equal protection and vagueness challenges. The court affirmed the circuit court's holding that the Act violated equal protection, but the Michigan Supreme Court reversed. The case was remanded back to the court for consideration of the vagueness issue. In reversing, the court held that because the Act was amended while the appeal was pending, it would consider the inmate's arguments as if they were addressed to the State Correctional Facility Reimbursement Act, which was the amended statute. Neither the former Act nor the amended statute impinged on First Amendment freedoms; therefore the traditional &quot;void for vagueness&quot; analysis did not apply. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 800.404 was not impermissibly vague under general statutory interpretation principles. Section 800.404(3), (4), (5), clearly set out the conditions for and limitations on reimbursement to the State for incarceration-related costs. It was as reasonably precise in its language as the subject matter permitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the medical center asserted that the widow was legally obligated to pay for necessary services provided to her late husband. The court found that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 557.21 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26.165(1)), by its plain language, stated that a wife was not responsible for the debts of her husband. However, the court held that the law was not static. It must keep pace with changes in society because the doctrine of stare decisis was not an iron mold that could never be changed. Equality under law and evenhanded treatment of the sexes in the modern market place must also carry the burden of responsibility that went with the benefits. Thus, the court held that a wife was liable for the medical necessaries of her husband. However, the court affirmed the lower courts' judgments because it would not be equitable to hold the widow liable where both parties had relied on prior law when the expense was incurred that the court had just changed to keep pace with the changes in society. The court adopted the principle prospectively so that it applied only to debts incurred after the date of the decision.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statute gave sufficient notice of the conduct that was prohibited and was neither vague on its face nor as applied to him. The record evidence showed that the jury could have found and did find beyond a reasonable doubt that the husband's conduct went beyond the boundaries of normal, reasonable, and timely discipline and, therefore, he was not convicted for engaging in constitutionally protected behavior. The husband argued that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of his prior convictions for larceny over $ 100, a felony offense involving theft. The court found that, under Mich. R. Evid. 609(a) both convictions were admissible where the trial court's balancing of the probative value and potential prejudice to defendant was not an abuse of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner challenged the conditions requiring it to dedicate an area for recreation purposes in order to obtain preliminary plat approval for his subdivision project.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant worked for the employer and had to work harder than usual because stockmen came to work late. After three hours of heavy lifting, the claimant began experiencing chest pains and was taken to the hospital. Subsequently, the claimant filed an application for benefits and the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board granted him total and permanent disability benefits. On appeal, the court held that the majority opinion contained no findings on the crucial link between the claimant's work duties and his heart attack. The court found that it could not know the path taken by the Board through the conflicting evidence, the testimony it had adopted, the standards followed, and the reasoning used to reach its conclusion. The court also held that the Board might not have conclusively presumed that the claimant's wife was his dependent, but that on remand the claimant was free to prove dependency in fact. The court found that should the Board find that the claimant was entitled to compensation benefits, he was not entitled to interest on reimbursement of medical expenses and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a township and others, sought review of a judgment of a circuit court (Michigan), which granted summary judgment for plaintiffs and which held that under &sect; 30(4) of the Solid Waste Management Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 299.401 et seq., the township was preempted from enforcing its ordinances to the extent that the ordinances would have interfered with construction and operation of plaintiffs' landfill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found that any local ordinance in conflict with the Solid Waste Management Act was not enforceable pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 299.430(4). The court agreed with this finding. Moreover, the court found that all local regulations concerning the operation of a landfill were preempted by the Solid Waste Management Act. However, the issue argued by the parties on appeal, whether the Solid Waste Management Act, in preempting the township's ordinances, violated Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 25 (1963), by amending the township rural zoning act without reenacting and publishing the act at length, was never addressed by the circuit court. In the interest of judicial economy, the court addressed the issue on appeal instead of remanding it for initial examination by the circuit court. The court found that the Solid Waste Management Act did not constitute an improper amendment of any statutory scheme related to the township's regulatory powers over land within its borders. The court held that an act complete within itself, even though amending another statute or act by implication, was not one of the evils sought to be prevented by Mich. Const. art 4, &sect; 25 (1963).</SPAN></P>

The lower court held that the child could not bring an action to determine parentage separate from that allowed under the Paternity Act and subject to the six-year limitation period under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.714(b) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25.494(b)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the child was born, his alleged father married defendant mother. The alleged father subsequently filed for divorce. The child brought an action seeking a determination of parentage and support obligations. The lower court granted the alleged father's motion for accelerated judgment. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that an illegitimate child could maintain an action to determine his parentage separate from that allowed under the Paternity Act. The court found that the state had no legitimate interest in denying the child an independent cause of action to determine parentage and support obligations in light of the state's compelling interest in assuring that the primary obligation for support of an illegitimate child fell on the parents rather than on the taxpayers. In addition, such compelling interest undercut the state's interest in preventing the prosecution of stale or fraudulent claims. Because the child's cause of action was not under the Paternity Act, the six-year period of limitation did not apply. Rather, the general disability tolling provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5851(1) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5851(1)) was applicable.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and found that the searches of the car and the shaving kit were perfectly valid searches incident to a lawful custodial arrest under the federal constitution. Furthermore, the state constitution did not provide any greater protection than the federal constitution. The court also found that the line of cases that indicated that inventory searches made by police at police stations were illegal in cases where the defendant was not informed of his rights under the interim bail statute did not apply to the present case because the search of defendants car was not an inventory search and the policies underlying the interim bail statute and a search incident to an arrest were completely different.</SPAN></P>

(Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3.548(101) et seq.). On appeal, the court held that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff's claim under the Act, and reversed the accelerated judgment granted to defendant. The court held that the Act applied to plaintiff, who had brought an original action against defendant and its agencies for violations of her civil rights. The Civil Service Commission had only concurrent jurisdiction with the trial court and the Michigan Department of Civil Rights when plaintiff had asserted a civil rights violation.

In a previous appeal that was affirmed by the state supreme court, the court reversed the lower court's finding that defendant's confession was involuntary. Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, and the court affirmed the convictions. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the information. The evidence was sufficient to establish probable cause that a crime had been committed and that the defendant committed it. The issue of whether the shooting was justified was not a question for the magistrate in the preliminary examination but was within the province of the trier of fact. The court also found that defendant consented to the entry into his apartment by the arresting officers. The officers were not required to specifically inform defendant of his right to require a warrant. Defendant admitted that he knew that the officers came to his home to arrest him and allowed them to enter his apartment. Thus, the arrest was valid.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. The court held that, based on the evidence, a rational trier of fact could have found that the elements of a forcible sexual contact were proven beyond a reasonable doubt and the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a directed verdict. The court also held that the denial of defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was proper because there was competent evidence to support the jury's verdict and reasonable men could have differed as to the meaning of the evidence. Defendant also contended that the fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct statute and the definition of &quot;sexual contact&quot; were void for vagueness. The court found that the forcible fondling of the complainant's breasts by defendant was sexual contact properly proscribed by the statute and he could not claim that the challenged statute did not provide him with sufficient notice that his conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged the enhancement of his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence from a misdemeanor to a felony. The court held that defendant's prior misdemeanor convictions could not be used to enhance his sentence because they were obtained without benefit of counsel. Defendant's consultation with an attorney did not constitute assistance of counsel at defendant's plea proceeding. Defendant also argued that the prosecutor was wrongfully permitted to introduce evidence that defendant refused to take a Breathalyzer test. The evidence of the refusal in the prosecutor's case-in-chief should not have been admitted because it was not evidence of guilt or innocence or an essential element of the prosecutor's case.

The State argued that the conservation officer was a peace officer with the authority to arrest a person for the commission of a misdemeanor in his presence, regardless of whether the infraction occurred while he was enforcing the conservation laws. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal and held that the conservation officer was not a police officer within the meaning of the Michigan Vehicle Code &sect; 42, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 300.16 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13.1226), and therefore was not authorized to enforce that code.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city, as part of its comprehensive sign regulation ordinance, restricted the number of days temporary signs were allowed to be displayed.

The court reversed the decision of the district court and concluded that the city's ordinance violated the First Amendment. Applying the factors to test the constitutionality of commercial speech regulations the court held that: 1) the commercial speech at issue was not unlawful or misleading; 2) although traffic safety, aesthetics, and safety from electrical hazards were substantial governmental interests, the ordinance failed to sufficiently advance the governmental interests asserted or reached further than necessary to accomplish those objectives; 3) all of the hazards allegedly created by the temporary display signs were otherwise addressed by other provisions of the city sign code, traffic code and electrical code; and 4) limiting use of temporary signs to 60 days per year did not directly advance the government's objective in abating the proffered hazards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner claimed that the notice was insufficient because it did not contain any reference to the statutory provision that the township was prohibited from continuing with the proposal if the record owners of land constituting more than 20 percent of the total land area in the special assessment district filed written objections with the township board at or before the hearing. The court declined to hold broadly that a notice of hearing was insufficient and a denial of due process unless it contained a reference to other statutory provisions available to the affected landowners, noting that the landowner did express her objection at the hearing. The court, however, pointed out that the notice indicated that all objections would have been heard at the hearing. The court said that not only did the notice not inform the landowner that her objections should have been presented in writing at or before the hearing in order to preserve her right to join with 20 percent of the landowners in stopping the project, the notice implied that the only available forum for objections was the hearing.

The court concluded that the trier of fact should have considered both the tortfeasor's fault in creating or maintaining an intentional nuisance and the swimmer's fault in approaching that nuisance with willful and wanton disregard of the high probability of harm, in determining which degree of each party's fault proximately caused the injury. The court held that the trial court erred by holding that the department's maintenance of the pond as a recreation area was not a governmental function and not entitled to governmental immunity; the pond was part of the system of state recreational facilities either expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by the constitution and statute, and it was not proprietary in nature.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts 333 was constitutional and did not violate Mich. Const. 1963, art. 9, &sect; 3, and that the school district failed to properly follow statutory procedures to enact a summer tax levy in the school district's mandamus action seeking delivery of the tax assessment roll.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district passed a resolution imposing a summer property tax levy of one-half of school property taxes within the school district and asked each township to do the actual collecting. The township had issues regarding &quot;reasonable expenses&quot; for its efforts. The school district acted as its own collection agent but the township refused to deliver its assessment roll. The school district filed a mandamus action against the township and its officials, who counterclaimed, alleging that 1982 Mich. Pub. Acts 333 was unconstitutional. The circuit court held that the statute was constitutional, but that the school district had not properly followed statutory procedures in enacting its levy. Both parties appealed and the court affirmed. The court held that 1982 Mich. Pub. Acts 333 entitled the school district to decide to collect the tax itself. The court found that the statute should have been construed so that the request for summer taxation should have been made by the elected board of education rather than by an administrative appointee, and that there was no language in the statute stating that the township retained its status as exclusive agent for tax collection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Detroit City Council enacted Ordinance 556-H, which created a procedure for the rehabilitation of abandoned houses by individuals prior to the city's formal acquisition of title. Applicants sought to participate in the program, but were refused. Thereafter, applicants filed a complaint for mandamus against city and city official in an effort to compel implementation of the ordinance. The trial court granted the order of mandamus. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that the case was appropriate for mandamus. Moreover, the court held the creation of a program designed to facilitate rehabilitation of abandoned housing in the City of Detroit was a proper exercise of the city council's legislative powers. The court held that the ordinance did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, as provided under the Detroit City Charter. Lastly, the court held that the ordinance was not preempted by the State Construction Code Act of 1972, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.1501, et seq., and Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2949(1), et seq., or by the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.51, et seq., and Mich. Stat. Ann. 8.265(1), et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix's decedent was treated for a burn on his arm and died the next day. The administratrix brought a medical malpractice action against the hospital and doctor. The trial court granted the hospital's motion to compel arbitration and denied the administratrix's motion to set aside the agreement. Accelerated judgment was granted for the hospital and doctor on the ground that a valid arbitration agreement existed pursuant to the Medical Malpractice Arbitration Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5040 et seq. The administratrix appealed, and the court reversed. The court found that the administratrix neither admitted nor denied that the arbitration agreement was executed. The court held that because no response was required to the motion for accelerated judgment, the administratrix had never conceded the factual issue on which the motion rested. The hospital contended that the administratrix's response had opposed arbitration on the single ground that the Act was unconstitutional and waived the right to address other issues. The court held that under Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 110.1 (1963), the administratrix had no duty to respond to the motion, much less a duty to raise every defense.</SPAN></P>

The court then held that the sentence was not cruel and unusual under U.S. Const. amend. VIII, even where the value of the merchandise was minor. The court similarly held that the sentence was not cruel or unusual under Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 (1963). The sentence could be considered proportionate to the crime; the standards of decency had not changed such that the legislature felt the need to amend the statute; and defendant faced better prospects of rehabilitation with a longer sentence than with a shorter one.</SPAN></P>

A defense witness claimed the charges would constitute a tremendous financial burden. The district court found that the prosecution had shown convincingly that the regulations were necessary and effective in reducing the response time of emergency vehicles. The district court concluded that the necessity for public safety outweighed the interference with interstate commerce. On appeal, the court found that defendant advanced no evidence or argument that the statute burdened interstate commerce generally. The court determined that there was, at most, a de facto limitation on the length of defendant's trains at but one location, a restriction which resulted from the curvature of defendant's own track. Therefore, the court concluded that defendant had not overcome the presumption of validity attached to the statute or the State's interest in facilitating timely responses to emergencies.</SPAN></P>
