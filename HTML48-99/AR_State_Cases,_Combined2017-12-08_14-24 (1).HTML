<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from a judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court, First Division (Arkansas), which convicted them of refusal to assist an officer in violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42-204 (1964) and resisting an officer in violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2801 (1964).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, a police officer testified that defendants refused to assist him in issuing an arrest warrant on a woman at her residence. He also testified that when he attempted to arrest defendants for that refusal, they resisted arrest. Defendants claimed that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42-204 was void on its face and as applied, in that it offended the United States Constitution. They further claimed that the evidence was insufficient to show a violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2801. In affirming defendant's convictions, the court found no evidence that the officer acted arbitrarily or recklessly. He asked for help in issuing the warrant because the woman had previously fled. He only asked defendants to warn him if the woman tried to leave by the back door. Defendant's Eighth Amendment rights were not violated because the punishment for failing to assist the officer was not so offensive to a fairness of justice as to be invalid. Further, nothing in the record indicated that there was arbitrary discrimination against defendants in the officer's exercise of his discretion. Additionally, the evidence sufficiently showed that defendants resisted arrest for refusal to obey the officer's command.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sodomy by an act of fellatio in violation of &sect; 41-813, which provided that every person convicted of sodomy, or buggery, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary for a period of not less than one nor more than 21 years. He appealed on the ground that no statute made fellatio a public offense, &sect; 41-813 was so vague as to deprive him of his federal constitutional rights, and that &sect; 41-813 established a religion and invaded the right of privacy. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment, holding that the crime of sodomy consisted of unnatural sexual relations between persons of the same sex, or with beasts, or between persons of different sex, but in an unnatural manner. Furthermore, the court found no merit in the contention that the statute was vague and too broad in scope. Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-814 referred to sodomy as a crime against nature, which was an unnatural sex act, which was condemned. It was the opposite of a natural sex act, the manner of a natural sex act was well known, even to the young and the uneducated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of the judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court (Arkansas), which convicted them of indecent exposure under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2701 (1964).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were dancers in a nightclub and were arrested after officers observed them dancing on a stage nude from the waist up. Apparently, a man painted defendants' breasts while they were dancing onstage. Section 41-2701 provided that it was a misdemeanor to appear in public places while partly naked with the intent of making a public exhibition of nudity. Defendants complained that there was no adversary hearing held to determine the issue of obscenity and that the convicting statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court upheld the convictions. The court found that there was no need for an adversary hearing on the issue of obscenity because defendants were not engaged in an &quot;exercise of freedom of expression,&quot; rather, they were doing what was prohibited by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2710 (1964). The court rejected defendants' argument that &sect; 41-2701 discriminated against them on the basis of gender because there was nothing to indicate that males were immune from prosecution under the statute. The court concluded that the acts involved were subject to police regulation.</SPAN></P>

No. 1747 took their property rights in violation of Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22 and the U.S. Constitution. The chancellor held that plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee had billboards on lands leased from the landowner. The city passed a zoning ordinance that prohibited some of the existing billboards, mandated their removal, and imposed criminal sanctions. The city charged plaintiffs with a violation after plaintiffs filed the declaratory judgment action. The chancellor held that plaintiffs could challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance as a defense in that action. On appeal, the court held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-2501, et seq. (1962) allowed declaratory judgment actions to be brought in equity to challenge the constitutionality of local ordinances. The court found that plaintiffs had alleged valid property interests in the use of the land for the billboards, which had been erected in conformity with existing laws and under permits issued by the city, and had alleged the taking of their property interests without compensation and in violation of their due process rights. The court held that plaintiffs had no adequate remedy at law and that the chancellor should have overruled the demurrer because the petition presented issues of fact that, if true, could render the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decree of the chancery court and remanded with directions to overrule the demurrer and to proceed further.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. He sought permission to proceed under Ark. R. Crim. P. I. The trial court granted permission, but limited the hearing to petitioner's allegations that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that his sentence was excessive due to the allegedly improper use of the habitual offender statutes. Among other things, petitioner alleged that the attorney refused to file a motion to suppress and discouraged him from going to trial and from testifying. The trial court denied relief and petitioner appealed. The court, in affirming the trial court's judgment, rejected petitioner's allegations that his trial counsel was ineffective. The court noted that the court-appointed attorney was a practitioner of 20 years and that he had met with petitioner to discuss the case. In addition, the court found that the attorney, faced with what he thought was substantial proof against petitioner, properly advised petitioner to enter a plea but also properly went to trial upon petitioner's insistence. Next, the court found no merit to petitioner's claim that the trial court improperly applied the habitual offender statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual had been ordered by the circuit court judge, not to publish the result of the jury verdict in a particular case.

The individual argued, among other things, that the order not to publish the trial verdict was void and that as a result thereof, the second contempt for failure to appear in person to the citation order would also be subject to collateral attack. The court held that no court had the power to prohibit the news media from publishing that which transpired in open court. The court also held that before a person could be held in contempt for violating a court order, the order had to be in definite terms as to the duties thereby imposed upon him and the command had to be expressed rather than implied. The citation order cited both the individual and the newspaper, a corporate entity, to appear.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A distributor filed a complaint against the buyer for payment of notes executed for the purchase of goods. The notes were payable to petitioner. The buyer cross-complained against the distributor and petitioner for malicious prosecution. He also filed a third party complaint against petitioner, alleging that petitioner maliciously instituted a replevin action. Petitioner claimed that the circuit court had no jurisdiction over it and sought a writ of prohibition to bar the judge from proceeding against it. The court granted the writ and held that because petitioner's alleged liability was not based upon the subject matter of the action brought by the distributor, petitioner could not be brought into the case. There was nothing to show that petitioner sought to replevy the same property for which the buyer executed the notes representing the debts he owed to the distributor. The court also held that petitioner's removal of the case to a federal district court and its subsequent remand did not waive venue requirements because upon remand the case stood in the same position it would have had it never been removed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-2830.1 (Repl. 1968), which allowed an appeal de novo to the circuit court from the enactment of rezoning ordinances by a city's legislative body, violated Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's board of directors enacted rezoning ordinances. The ordinances rezoned certain properties adjacent to the adjacent owners' properties. The rezoned properties were owned separately by the property owners. The circuit court properly dismissed the appeals. Section 19-2830.1 was not allowed to empower the judiciary to take away the discretionary powers vested by the state legislature in the city's legislative body to enact zoning and rezoning ordinances. The provisions of the statute provided for a trial de novo, including the right of a trial by jury, in reviewing the city's legislative action. On appeal, the issue would have been tried entirely anew, the same as if the city's governing board had not acted. By this method of appellate review de novo there was attempted to impose upon the circuit court a function of a non-judicial character in a matter that was exclusively within the discretion and legitimate power of the city's legislative body. The result would have been to substitute the judgment of the circuit court for that of a municipal law-making body. That was contrary to Ark. Const. art. 4, which prohibited intrusion by the judiciary upon the legislative domain.</SPAN></P>

The fire occurred in Grant County, Arkansas. However, the railroad filed suit against the corporation in Pulaski County, Arkansas. The trial court granted the corporation's motion to quash service because venue was not proper in Pulaski County. The railroad argued that it could file suit in Pulaski County under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-611(1962) because that was where the railroad had its principal place of business and therefore its residence. Affirming the judgment, the court held that venue did not lie in Pulaski County. Because the railroad was foreign corporation, it did not have a residence in any county in Arkansas, Thus, under the terms of &sect; 27-611, the only place where the railroad could file suit was in the county in which the accident giving rise to the property damage occurred.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-3812 -- 3823 (Supp. 1969), commonly known as the Sunday Closing Law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The merchant was of the Jewish faith and sought to keep his store open for general business on Sunday. The decree did not declare the Act unconstitutional. Instead it provided that he could sell listed commodities on Sunday, conditioned upon his closing his individual proprietorship from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, in conformity with the tenets of his religion. Under 1965 Ark. Laws 135 &sect;10, the merchant could not be prosecuted for opening on Sunday if he conscientiously observed another day of rest in accordance with the requirements of his religion. The statute also permitted, under &sect;12 of the Act, cities and towns adjacent to those in other states to enact ordinances to permit Sunday sales. On review the court found that the Sunday Closing Law was valid. It further found that &sect; 12 of the Act was neither local legislation nor a delegation of legislative authority, and that the classification had a reasonable relation to the purpose of the Act. Based on the merchant's testimony as to the tents of his religion, the court found the decree was not against the preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lot owners owned property which abutted, in part, upon the purported easement.

The trial court held that the lot owners had no right in a purported public easement. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that there was no merit to the corporation's argument that the original grant was never intended as a public easement. The city's requirement that there was to be a public access and the plain words of the grant itself belied that argument. If there was acceptance by use, there could not be any abandonment by non-use, obstruction of the way, even if either could have otherwise barred the rights of the public, because neither could have continued for the required seven year period. The property right of ingress and egress of the lot owners was one that could not be taken from them by the city, at least without payment of just compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individuals sought review of a decision of the Pulaski Chancery Court, Second Division (Arkansas) in which the chancellor held that the Documentary Tax Stamp Act, 1969 Ark. Acts 239, was valid. When the case was before the court previously on direct appeal, the court held that Act 239, which imposed a tax on the transfer of real property, was unconstitutional and void under Ark. Const. amend. XX.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that Act 239 did not authorize appellees, the members of the State Parks, Recreation and Travel Commission of the State of Arkansas, to issue revenue bonds and to pledge to the payment of the bonds those revenues derived from the tax imposed by Act 239. On rehearing, the court concluded that Act 239 was severable and that portions of it were constitutional and valid. The court determined that the primary intent of the legislature was to raise funds for the financing and maintenance of several funds and the state parks. It also held that the act was severable in the purpose of its enactment and in the method of distribution of the funds collected. In addition, the levy under Act 239 was a tax, and that the proceeds from the tax were state revenues subject to the prohibitions in Ark. Const. amend. XX. The court reversed in part, finding that the bond provisions in &sect; 6(b)(2), (3) of Act 239 were null and void because the revenues that &sect; 6(b)(2) attempted to pledge to the several funds were state revenues. The court affirmed in part, finding that &sect; 1 of Act 239 simply levied an excise tax on the sale of real property and was not prohibited by the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its supplemental opinion on rehearing, the court reversed the trial court's decision in part by holding that the bond provisions of Act 239 were null and void. The court also held that the bond funds being held were to be maintained in their present status pending further directions from the legislature. The court affirmed the decision as to the validity of the rest of Act 239.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1431(1964) provided that anyone who created a disturbance or breach of the peace on public school property was guilty of a misdemeanor. Defendants argued that the statute was vague and overbroad and caused a chilling effect on the exercise of their First Amendment tights. The court found that it was difficult to conceive of language more vague than that in the statute declaring one to be a violator of the law if he created a disturbance or breach of the peace in any way whatsoever. Other language used in the statute, including &quot;offensive talk,&quot; &quot;attempting to intimidate,&quot; and &quot;any other conduct which causes a threatened breach of the peace,&quot; was also considered vague. The court held that men of average intelligence would have to guess as to what conduct was proscribed by those phrases. The offensive portions of the statute were not severable.

Two of the commissioners were stockholders of a company, which owned more than half of the land in the proposed district. The association, representing 163 remonstrants who also owned property in the area, opposed the district. The trial court found that there was no conflict of interest to disqualify the commissioners and that the petition was proper under the Act and did not violate any constitutional rights of property owners in the area. The trial court found that the Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers and did not deprive remonstrants of any rights or property without due process of law. On appeal, the court affirmed. The Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority because the district was a de jure governmental agency, and its power to further designate land to be included was not a delegation of legislative authority. Also, the district had to act for the benefit of all affected landowners, who had a right to have the district's decisions judicially reviewed under Ark. Stat. Ann &sect; 19-3629 (1968).</SPAN></P>

The trial court's judgment of conviction against defendant was affirmed. The court held that books and records of the city collector's office were public records, and were available at all times to defendant by virtue of the Freedom of Information Act pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 12-2801 - 12-2807 (1968). Further, any proof of defendant's embezzlement in the last three years prior to the indictment was admissible under the three-year statute of limitations. In addition, the jury selection statute, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-201- 39-231 (1962), was not ipso facto unconstitutional in preventing a representative cross section of the community from being placed on the jury rolls. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing rebuttal testimony that could have been introduced in chief. Also, the trial court did not err in admitting testimony of a layman in identifying defendant's handwriting because the layman had worked with defendant for more than three years and was thoroughly familiar with defendant's handwriting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, members of the Arkansas Racing Commission and the Arkansas Attorney General, sought review of an order of the Chancery Court of Pulaski County, Third Division (Arkansas), which held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-2823.10 (Supp. 1969), imposing a residency requirement on officers and directors of dog racing tracks, was unconstitutional, in appellee racing corporation's action for a declaration that &sect; 84-2823.10 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated a greyhound racetrack in a certain county. The legislature amended existing betting laws by enacting Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-2823.10 (Supp. 1969), which imposed a two-year county residency requirement on all officers and directors of greyhound dog tracks. The corporation filed an action for a declaration that &sect; 84-2823.10 was unconstitutional under the privileges and immunities clauses of the state and federal constitutions and also under the due process, equal protection, and interstate commerce clauses. The trial court held that &sect; 84-2823.10 was unconstitutional as a grant of special privileges and immunities in violation of Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 84-2823.10 was valid as a reasonable exercise of police power. The court held that operation of a dog track was a privilege, not a right, and that the State was thus permitted to impose conditions on the exercise of such privilege beyond those that might be imposed on enjoyment of matters of common right. A residency requirement assisted authorities in the necessary policing of racetracks, as establishments involving gambling and attempts for control by criminal syndicates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order and held that the state law imposing a residency requirement on officers and directors of the corporation was valid.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the imposition of premium tax due each March 1, was upon premiums received the previous calendar year while defendant insurance company was an authorized insurer in the state. The judgment against defendant insurance company for tax due on March 1, 1968, included premiums received from the revocation date of May 1, until December 31, 1967, during which time defendant insurance company was not an authorized insurer in the state.

Upon appeal by the property owner, the court reversed the judgment. When the property owner first noticed that his land was being cleared for construction he made an immediate investigation, which revealed appellees' plan to erect a building on the property. The property owner informed a church member whom he thought to be in charge of the project, that he was reasonably sure that the site was his land. Despite that warning appellees went ahead with their plans to erect the building. There was no evidence tending to show that the property owner misled appellees in any way. The most that could be said was that he did not follow up his warning by filing a suit to enjoin the construction. That, however, was not his duty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railroad company challenged the jury verdict and judgment entered in the Conway County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which awarded monetary damages to appellee estate administrator following the death of certain of his family members, who were killed in an accident involving a train and a passenger car. The case had been remanded for retrial after a jury previously entered a verdict against the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate administrator filed a negligence action against the railroad company. He prevailed, and on appeal the case was remanded for a new trial. The same witnesses presented the same testimony and evidence, and additional evidence was presented regarding the dangerous conditions of the railroad crossing where the fatal accident occurred. The jury again entered a judgment for the estate administrator and awarded a higher amount of damages. On appeal, the company asserted that there was insufficient proof of negligence and that the estate administrator was not entitled to an award for mental anguish for the death of his grandchildren. The company asserted that the children's father lived longer than they did and that under 1957 Ark. Acts 255 the grandfather was not the children's heir at law. The court noted there was adequate proof of the negligence. It noted that the law of the case doctrine precluded the company from asserting a new claim that the estate administrator was not entitled to the mental anguish damages. Such a claim should have been raised below. It noted that when an entire family was killed there should not be a literal interpretation of the words heirs at law.</SPAN></P>

The second search occurred after defendants were arrested as a result of police surveillance, and the third search was carried out the day following the arrest pursuant to another search warrant. Defendants sought to suppress the evidence from the searches, but the trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed defendants' convictions. The court held that as to the first and third searches, defendants failed to sustain their burden because they offered no proof that the warrants were invalid or lacked probable cause. With regard to the second search, it was valid because it was a continuation of the first search and because it constituted a search incident to a lawful arrest. Thus, the evidence seized was admissible, and the motion to suppress was properly denied. Also, the evidence was sufficient, and the prosecutor's closing argument did not contain improper or prejudicial remarks as to defendants' failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into an oral agreement with her landlord to rent an apartment on a weekly basis at the rate of $ 22 per week. On June 23, 1967, the landlord served the defendant with a 10-day notice to vacate the apartment for nonpayment of rent. On July 20, 1967, 28 days after service of the notice to vacate, the defendant had not moved from the apartment, so she was charged with violating Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 50-523 (1947). Section 50-523 provided that any person who rented a dwelling and who refused to pay the rent and did not move out after being given 10-days notice in writing, could be found guilty for wilfully refusing to vacate and surrender the possession of the premises to the landlord. Upon conviction, the tenant would be guilty of a misdemeanor and could be fined by the court. The court affirmed. The court held that the defendant did not have any right or claim on the property and that she had illegally retained possession of it. The court concluded that &sect; 50-523 was constitutional; that it was a valid exercise of the police power of the state; and that it did not deprive defendant of her due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The tax was basically a three percent excise tax levied upon gross proceeds derived from sales of tangible personal property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute, however, also imposed the tax upon a number of transactions that might not otherwise be thought to fall within the scope of what was originally a retail sales tax. The chancery court sustained the taxpayer's contention that primarily about 85 percent of its revenue was recompense for services not falling within the statutory phrase, &quot;photography of all kinds,&quot; of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-1903 (d) (Repl. 1960). In reversing, the court did not interpret the statute to mean that the incidence of the gross receipts tax should be similarly divided between nontaxable revenue from professional services and taxable revenue from the taking of pictures. Hardly any tangible article or commodity was priced solely on the basis of its constituent materials. Invested capital, education or technical training, professional skill, labor, and overhead expenses, or some combination of them, could be expected to contribute to the value and selling price of the finished product. The court concluded that regardless of how the taxpayer billed its customers, what its patrons were buying and paying for were photographs.</SPAN></P>

The following May, they purchased a landlocked parcel that was adjacent to the first tract. The Commission condemned a right-of-way across the owners' property. A jury awarded the owners damages. The court held that there was no error in the trial judge refusing to disqualify and in refusing to quash the jury panel. However, the Commission's proffered instruction, regarding minimization of damages, should have been given because there was evidence that the owners could have mitigated their severance damages. Moreover, it was obvious that the owners knew, or certainly believed, that the interstate would be built exactly where it was built. Any enhancement in value, which was brought about in anticipation of a proposed improvement, was excluded in determining market value. Thus, under the evidence, the Commission's instruction, regarding the landlocked parcel, should have been given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate ran for office and in filing as a candidate paid a fee. The candidate was unsuccessful in his race for office and he then filed a claim for reimbursement of the fee. The trial court held that Act 68 was unconstitutional because it was discriminatory. The court first noted that it did not pass upon constitutional questions if the litigation could have been determined without deciding those issues. The court held that the candidate did not take the proper steps to insure a return of the fee, whatever the status of the act in question. The candidate raised no complaint until after the election had been held and it had been determined that he was the losing candidate. It was not disputed that the payment of the filing fee was entirely voluntary. The court determined that the most that could have been said on the candidate's behalf was that payment was made under a mistake of law. The candidate was presumed to know the law and yet he voluntarily made a payment which, according to his contention, the law would not have compelled him to make.

Ann. &sect; 27-2502(e), which gave Arkansas jurisdiction over a person having an interest in real estate in Arkansas, was unconstitutional. The court denied the writ, finding that although the litigant did not live in Arkansas, he owned real property within the state's boundaries, had paid real estate taxes to the state, and undoubtedly looked to Arkansas law and courts for the protection of his interest in the property. The cause of action was based on a purported transaction arising out of the ownership of the Arkansas real estate.

The trial court awarded damages against the driver and denied the car owner's claim in intervention to recover property damages from one of the ambulance occupants.</SPAN></P>

Though he never inspected the ambulance, the chief of police testified that he considered it to be an emergency vehicle because it was equipped with red lights and a siren, and he knew it was used to bring patients to the city's hospitals. Appellants timely challenged the validity of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-402(d) (Repl. 1957), the section of the Uniform Motor Vehicle code that defined an authorized emergency vehicle and authorized the chief to make such a designation without providing a standard to guide the chief in administering his duties. On review, the court found that the grant of unbridled discretion to the chief was fatal to part of &sect; 75-402 (d) because a valid statute could not delegate absolute, unregulated, or undefined discretion in an administrative body. The court held that other sections requiring certain equipment on emergency vehicles did not establish sufficient standards for the licensing of an emergency vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were interstate bus carriers. They filed reports with the Commissioner indicating mileage traveled. The Commissioner taxed them for the special distillate fuel that they used at the rate of one gallon per five miles traveled. This rate was set out in &sect; 75-1251. The taxpayers sought a refund, with interest, to the extent that the rate was inaccurate as applied to them. The trial court entered judgment for the taxpayers. The court modified and affirmed the decree. Interstate bus carriers that bought fuel out of state paid more tax per gallon than intrastate bus carriers. Consequently, the interstate carriers were discriminated against for not purchasing fuel in Arkansas. Therefore, the statutory rate burdened interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Modification of the decree was necessary to change the statement that &sect; 75-1251 was entirely unconstitutional to a statement that it was unconstitutional insofar as the mile per gallon presumption. It was improper for the trial court to award interest because sovereign immunity insulated the State from interest, and because the State had not consented to such liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of the Lincoln County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which granted defendant's motion to quash an information charging him with failure to discharge mechanics' and materialmen's liens in violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-640 (Supp. 1965).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that the ruling of the trial court should be corrected to preserve uniformity in the administration of the criminal law. Defendant argued that &sect; 51-640 was unconstitutional in that it attempted to establish a prima facie case of intent to defraud when a contractor failed to discharge a lien within 10 days after receipt of payment. Defendant also contended that because he was adjudged bankrupt, his person and property were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. In reversing the decision, the court held that &sect; 51-640 could not be classified as a peonage statute and that the presumption clause had a rational connection with the balance of state statutes governing mechanics' and materialmen's liens. The presumption of innocence remained with the accused, and the accused was merely required to go forward with his proof when the lien was established, payment was proven, and the failure to satisfy the lien was shown. Finally, the federal bankruptcy law was a civil proceeding enacted for the relief of persons financially distressed and certainly did not purport to preempt state penal statutes.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 80-1304(b) (Supp. 1965), and damages, in the teacher's action challenging appellants' refusal to issue her a new contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the school year, the teacher received a leave of absence under the terms of a policy listed in a policy handbook and also received disability benefits. Appellants later denied her request for a new contract for the next school year. In the teacher's suit seeking to require the issuance of a new contract, appellants argued that the teacher had not applied for reinstatement according to the handbook provisions and had not followed the required procedure from removing herself from the disability retirement rolls. On appeal from a decree for the teacher, the court held that the trial court improperly relied on &sect; 80-1304(b). &sect; 80-1304(b) required the renewal of a teacher's contract absent a timely notice of non-renewal, but applied only to regular teachers who fulfilled their contracts. The court noted that the teacher's status had changed from active status and that &sect; 80-1304(b) was not controlling. The teacher had not complied with the contractual notification requirements for reinstatement, whether those requirements were considered as necessitated under a new contract under which she was granted leave or under her teaching contract, and was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation challenged a decree of the Pulaski Circuit Court (Arkansas), which overruled its demurrer to the complaint of appellee citizens and restrained and enjoined the corporation from violating the Sunday Closing Ordinance, Code of the City of Little Rock, Ark., &sect; 25-115.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens brought a suit to enjoin the corporation from violating the Ordinance. The trial court overruled the corporation's demurrer and entered a decree enjoining the corporation from violating the Ordinance. The corporation argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction to enjoin the commission of a criminal offense when the complaining parties did not allege any injury and that the Ordinance was invalid because it exceeded a municipal corporation's authority to regulate, because it declared something to be a nuisance which was actually not a nuisance, and because it was too vague and uncertain to be effective. The court observed that the fact that the violation of an act constituted a criminal offense did not affect the power of a court of equity to grant injunctive relief. Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-2335 (Supp. 1965) was sufficiently broad and definite to grant the city full and complete authority to enact the Ordinance. Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3818 (Supp. 1965) also declared illegal Sunday sales to be a public nuisance. The Ordinance was not too vague or uncertain because business people of ordinary knowledge would be able to know what exceptions were encompassed by the Ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner denied the permit, finding that the tobacco company had failed to comply with Regulation I. Regulation I required the tobacco company to submit letters from not less than three-fourths of the cigarette manufacturers who had general distribution of cigarettes in the state that such manufacturers would ship on open account on approval of the application. The tobacco company filed an action attacking the constitutionality of Regulation I. The trial court found that Regulation I was unconstitutional, and the Commissioner sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that Regulation I made it possible to deny to a citizen of the state, otherwise qualified, the right to operate a lawful business. The Regulation also gave immense power to cigarette manufacturers in that they could decide who would sell cigarettes wholesale in the state. The Regulation violated Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2, in that it imposed an unusual and unnecessary restriction on a lawful occupation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court determined that the city's ordinances sought to condemn the landowners' property for use as an industrial park, not a port facility, which was an unconstitutional taking of private property for a private use. On appeal, the city contended that the industrial park was a public use because it related to adjacent port facilities, and that the taking was authorized. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the city only had the power expressly or impliedly given to it by statute or by the constitution. A grant of eminent domain power was strictly construed. Likewise, doubts as to a municipality's power were resolved against it. Based on the foregoing, the court held there was no delegation of eminent domain power that justified the city's taking of the instant agricultural lands for the purpose of industrial development, whether or not it was related to a port. Moreover, the doctrine of necessity did not apply because the city's proposed use was private. Finally, the expenditure of tax funds on the project did not convert it into a lawful, public taking.</SPAN></P>

The state charged them with violating Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51-640 for failure to discharge materialman's liens on one of the houses they were building and the lower court convicted them. The court reversed the conviction because it found the lower court improperly excluded as immaterial evidence that would have shown the defendants had not intended to defraud the homeowner. The court found the intent to defraud was a necessary element of the offense and if the jury believed the proffered proof that their insolvency and consequent failure to satisfy the liens resulted from inexperience, the jury could have found no intent to defraud. Because the evidence was relevant it should have been admitted. The court also noted that it was improper for the lower court to tell the jury that proof of a certain fact was sufficient to support the convictions because the jury had to decide the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff qualified elector and intervenor resident of Washington County appealed from a declaratory judgment of the Pulaski Chancery Court, First Division (Arkansas) in an action seeking a declaratory judgment and other relief against defendants, the Chairmen of the Democratic and Republican State Committees, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and all other necessary state officers and members of the State Board of Election Commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A declaratory judgment sought to determine the proper method for filling a vacancy in the Fourth Congressional District. The chancery court held that organized political parties had the right to conduct primary elections to select nominees to fill the vacancy, and that any such election was to be held in the 20 counties comprising the Fourth Congressional District, as set out in Act 3 of the First Extraordinary Session of the General Assembly of 1965 (Act 3). On appeal, it was urged that Act 3 was unconstitutional by disfranchising the electors in the eight counties removed from the old district. The court disagreed, as those electors now lived in other districts and were free to vote in those districts. The argument that Act 3 did not yet apply was in direct conflict with its emergency clause. The court agreed with the chancery court that each organized political party had the right to call a special primary election to select a nominee. The court disagreed that such primaries were impliedly prohibited by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-404 (1956). The legislature intended to provide for special primaries to select nominees to run in a special general election to be called by the Governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the declaratory judgment issued by the chancery court defining the method for filling a vacant seat in the Fourth Congressional District. The court also affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the intervention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Hot Spring Circuit Court (Arkansas) that was entered on a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter on an information charging him with murder in the second degree for feloniously, and with malice aforethought, murdering his wife. Pursuant to his conviction, defendant was sentenced to five years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When an altercation occurred outside the courtroom, the trial court closed the courtroom to the public with the exceptions of those witnesses and parties the attorneys believed necessary to the trial. On appeal, defendant asserted five claims, which were condensed into a single consideration of whether the denial of a public trial in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VI and Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 10 mandated reversal of his conviction. Holding that it did, the court determined that the purpose of a public trial was as an effective restraint on the possible abuse of judicial power, not only as to gross abuses, but also minor ones, and it operated as a safeguard against an attempt to employ the courts as instruments of persecution. Further, although it possessed inherent power to preserve order and decorum in the courtroom, the trial court's response to the disturbance outside the courtroom was not essential to the maintenance of decorum, particularly because the disturbance did not occur within the courtroom and the trial court did not attempt to ascertain the participants' identities. Thus, reversible error occurred when defendant was denied his constitutional right to a public trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured, a contractor, carried a policy insuring against losses arising from the construction of a gymnasium for a school, and when one or more roofing joists fell, the building was damaged extensively. The insured filed suit, alleging a loss resulting from the casualty, his demand for payment of the loss, less a deductible, and the company's refusal to pay. The company denied that the loss was covered and denied the insured's right to recover. The jury made an award to the insured but disallowed the profit that he sought, and on that ground the company insisted that he was not entitled to the statutory penalty and fees. On review, the court agreed with the company that the insured was not entitled to recover the penalty and fee provided by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 66-3238 (Supp. 1963) because he sought or demanded more than he recovered. The court rejected arguments that the allowance of the penalty and fees was a matter of the trial court's discretion and refused to overrule or modify the numerous cases holding that a plaintiff had to recover the amount demanded before he was entitled to the penalty and fee demanded.</SPAN></P>

The statute provided that a railroad's gross revenues and deductions were to be determined under the Interstate Commerce Act (Act) pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Commission's (ICC) standard classification of accounts. The Act gave the ICC discretionary authority to prescribe the uniform standard classification of accounts applicable to the railroad.

Later, the information was amended by making an additional charge that defendants had been previously convicted of separate offense.

At the beginning of trial, defendants entered guilty pleas to the part of the information charging the previous convictions. However, defendants pleaded not guilty to the principal offense of grand larceny. The jury's attention was called to the fact that defendants had pleaded guilty to being convicted of the previous offenses. Defendants were convicted as charged. The court reversed on appeal, holding that the trial court erred in calling the fact that defendants had pleaded guilty to the previous offenses to the jury's attention. The court reasoned that the trial court should have handled the matter by instructing the jury about the increased penalty without reading the previous conviction portion of the information to the jury.

However, the distributors requested that the court disregard the legal mistakes and make a ruling on the principal issue. At issue was whether the magazines were obscene and whether Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2713-2728 (Repl. 1964) violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, as abridging freedom of speech and press. The court recognized that stories and picture dealing with sex were not necessarily obscene. The material only became obscene when it dealt with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest. Because no national standard could be established, the court used a community standard. This was the function of the jury, which could do a better job of reflecting the conscience of the community than could members of the court. Viewing the total contents of each magazine, it could be said that their dominant theme appealed only to the prurient interest. The injunction provided only that particular issues not be sold. The court found that application of the statute did not deprive the distributors of his property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision enjoining sale of the magazines and ordering that they be destroyed.</SPAN></P>

The provisions, which required the candidate to secure a petition of 15 percent of the qualified electors, were still in full force and effect. Second, the court held that the legislature, in passing 1955 Ark. Acts 352, did not intend to place a lighter burden upon independent candidates than that which was placed upon candidates who ran in party primaries. To permit an independent candidate to run for office where there was no vacancy without securing a petition signed by 15 percent of the qualified electors would have been unfair and unjust to the regular candidate who had been nominated for office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner and the Arkansas State Banking Board, sought review of a decision of the Pulaski Chancery Court, First Division (Arkansas) in appellee bank's declaratory judgment action to interpret legislation repealing the statute under whose authority the bank had opened a teller's window. The chancery court enjoined appellants from requiring the bank to close the teller's window.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank was originally given permission by the Board to open the teller's window under the authority of Act 191, 1935 Ark. Gen. Assembly, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67-319 (1957) (the 1935 Act), which provided that no office was to be continued at any place after a legally chartered bank had actually commenced business at that place. Appellants then issued a charter to a another banking institution authorizing a new banking business in the same locality. Act 190, 1961 Ark. Gen. Assembly, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67-340 et seq. (Supp. 1963), repealed the 1935 Act and was amended by Act 544, 1963 Ark. Gen. Assembly. In reversing the ruling that the bank could not be required to close the teller's window, the court held that the 1935 Act could not operate to protect the teller's window from the closing requirement. The history of the legislation at issue confirmed the legislative policy to encourage organization of local banks by requiring a teller's window to close when a banking institution was chartered in a community where only window services had been furnished.Banking by a corporation was a privilege, not a right. The legislation at issue was a valid exercise of Arkansas's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the ruling in favor of the bank, dissolved the injunction, and dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the victim's testimony, evidence that a folder containing various identification cards bearing defendant's name was found in the victim's bedroom, and evidence that the victim's purse was found in defendant's car was more than adequate to sustain his conviction. The court stated that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-403 (1947) provided that a peace officer could make an arrest without a warrant where he had reasonable grounds for believing that the person arrested had committed a felony. The court opined that the finding of defendant's identification at the victim's home provided reasonable grounds to believe that he had committed a felony. The court concluded that evidence found upon a person legally arrested could have been used against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a state citizen and taxpayer, petitioned the Chancery Court of Pulaski County (Arkansas) in a taxpayer action, under Ark. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 13, to enjoin and restrain appellees, certain state officials, from paying out or receiving public funds over and above their regular salaries and challenging the constitutionality of 1961 Ark. Acts 399 (Act 399). The trial court granted appellees summary judgment. Appellant attacked the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that appellees paid out or received under Act 399 and that expenses authorized by other legislation been paid out and received by one or more of the appellees. Appellant and appellees filed motions for summary judgment in the case. The trial court granted the motion of appellees for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint of appellant on the grounds that Act 399 was not unconstitutional on its face and that appellant had failed to introduce any evidence to show that the amounts received were unreasonable, arbitrary, used for unofficial purposes, or that the payments constituted an increase in salary rather than reimbursement or payment of expenses legally incurred. The court held that there was no constitutional prohibition precluding the lieutenant governor, the secretary of state, the treasurer of state, the auditor of state, the attorney general, or the land commissioner, from receiving expenses for the purposes set forth in Act 399 in addition to their authorized salaries. The court also held that the speaker of the house was not prohibited from receiving expenses in addition to his entitlements enumerated in Ark. Const. amend. 48.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of the trial court and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, state and local officials, appealed from those parts of the rulings of the Pulaski Chancery Court, First Division (Arkansas), which gave declaratory judgment that Acts Nos. 12, 14, and 16, 1958 Ark. Gen. Assembly Second Extraordinary Session, 1959 Ark. Acts vol. 2, 2023 et seq., were unconstitutional. Plaintiffs, an association and officers thereof (NAACP), cross-appealed the judgment that Act No. 13 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court held that Act. No. 12, which required organizations who interfered with schools to reveal membership information to a county judge, was overbroad and restricted judicial access and vested officials with too much discretion; that Act. Nos. 14, which redefined the crimes of barratry, maintenance, and champerty were so vague and broad as to prevent good faith and meritorious advice from lawyers and nonlawyers alike, precluded anyone from assisting anyone else in bringing or defending either criminal or civil cases, and violated privacy and equal protection. On appeal, the court found it unnecessary to accept or reject these reasons and applied recent United States Supreme Court precedent, as well as precedent from Virginia, since the Acts were modeled on Virginia laws. The court held that such precedent clearly held that these Acts were unconstitutional. The court also held that Act. No. 16, which superficially gave the Attorney General the power to get tax records, was aimed at the NAACP and required information in a manner proscribed by the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declared that all four of the challenged acts were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The telephone operator heard the victim's screams and called police, who traced the call and sent officers. The victim's father tried to help her but was struck and left bleeding. The victim was dragged from her home to a remote spot two blocks away. The court found the evidence sufficient to support the verdict, observing that, among other things, hair specimens in the victim's home matched defendant's hair, fibers from the victim's pajamas were found in defendant's clothing, semen stains were found on the victim's pajamas, and sperm was found in the victim. The court noted that defendant's clothing was properly obtained from him and his home and no motion to quash was filed. The court observed that no motion to suppress was filed for any item sent to the FBI laboratory and no objection was made to the admissibility of that evidence, so admissibility was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, African Americans, went into three different stores and attempted to obtain service at the lunch counters. Defendants were prosecuted under Act 226 after they refused police orders to leave two of the stores, although the store managers did not tell them to leave. Defendants were prosecuted under Act 14 after they refused management's request that they leave one of the stores. Defendants argued that Act 226 and Act 14 were unconstitutional on multiple grounds. The court reversed the convictions that were prosecuted under Act 226 but affirmed the convictions prosecuted under Act 14. The court held that defendants did not violate Act 226 because their efforts to get service at the lunch counters was lawful and did not constitute a conspiracy to breach the peace. The court also held that Act 14 was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to defendants who were convicted under it. The conduct proscribed by Act 14 was clear and unequivocal; the failure to leave constituted a trespass. Act 14 did not violate equal protection principles because by its terms and on its face, it applied to all who refused to leave and it was not restricted to African Americans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had passed ordinance 209 that declared that all pinball machines or other gaming devises were a public nuisance.

The chancery court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was a conflict between the ordinance and state statutes on the same subject. The state statute made such devises legal; thus, the city could not declare them a public nuisance. The court found that the state statutes on the devices preempted the city's ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the professional organizations referred to were private, and not public, despite their contribution to the public educational system. The court found that expenditure of public funds for retirement income of the employees of the private organizations was not an expenditure for a public purpose. The court also found that the employees' contributions to the system did not remedy the unconstitutionality because, if the annuitant outlived the amount of his contributions, public finds would be unlawfully expended.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The killer began an affair with the decedent's wife.

It sought damages for disruption of the family ties and for depriving the children of the parental care, instruction, and affection of their mother. The killer argued that such a cause of action did not exist in Arkansas. The court reversed the judgment that was entered in favor of the children on count I, but affirmed the remainder of the judgment. The children did not have a right of action, the court held, to recover for disruption of the family ties. The court observed that there was common law or statutory cause of action for such disruption and stated that to create such a cause of action was solely within the province of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of the crime of overdrafting by executing and delivering to a creditor a check with the felonious intent to defraud the creditor. Defendant was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. The evidence revealed that defendant and the creditor had had many dealings with one another in the past and that the creditor had at one time given a check to defendant that had been dishonored for insufficient funds. Defendant was charged as a result of delivering a check to the creditor at a time when he knew that there were insufficient funds in his account. The court reversed the conviction. It held that although the bank's dishonoring of the check served as prima facie evidence of an intent to defraud, that presumption carried no probative force once it was revealed that the creditor was not defrauded as a result of the worthless check. The court noted that the check was intended as a repayment of an existing debt and that the creditor did not lose any money as a result of taking the check.</SPAN></P>

The company relied on the service, and the trial court dismissed. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, grave vault corporation and its salesman, appealed the order from the Pulaski Chancery Court (Arkansas), which ruled in favor of defendant purchasers, in plaintiffs' action for a declaratory judgment relative to the validity of 1961 Ark. Acts 78 (Act). Plaintiffs claimed that the Act was in contravention of both the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Arkansas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was engaged in selling fiberglass grave vaults through its salesman to the general public, under a procedure sometimes referred to as &quot;pre-need&quot; contracts. Prior to the passage of the Act, the vaults were sold in installment contracts at an average price of $ 195 each and the salesman received a commission of 25 percent from the first 25 percent of the installment monies paid to the corporation. The Act required all funds collected under contract for prepaid funeral benefits to be placed in a bank and that no withdrawals could be made unless accompanied by a death certificate. Plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the Act related to a proper subject for the exercise of the state's police power because the public had a vital interest in the proper disposition of the bodies of its deceased members. The court found that the &quot;pre-need&quot; contracts were analogous to a form of insurance and that the trust fund provisions of the Act were designed to assure the purchasers that the corporation would be able to complete their contracts when the time for performance arrived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying plaintiffs a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Assembly, which established appellee State Reserve Fund Commission and authorized the Commission to borrow money from the state and issue certificates to evidence its debt, as a means of financing construction for intervenor state colleges. The Pulaski Chancery Court (Arkansas) dismissed her complaint, and the taxpayer sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Act, the funds borrowed were repaid with the interest received from the investment of state funds by the State Board of Finance. The interest was to be placed in a special fund pledged to the payment of the certificates and was to be the sole source from which payment was to be made. The court held that the legislature was not prohibited by the Arkansas Constitution from separating the interest from the principal and pledging it, because interest, when separated from the principal by legislative enactment, was not taxes as that term was ordinarily used. There was no requirement that the interest be deposited in the state treasury. Ark. Const. amend. 20 prohibited bonds or instruments issued by the state itself for which the pledged security was the state's faith and credit, but the pledging of state or public revenues was not prohibited unless the pledge was the payment of state bonds. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that the certificates were speculative and not readily marketable, noting that the safeguards provided in Act 65, 1961 Ark. Gen. Assembly &sect;&sect; 7(a), 11, and 13 demonstrated the soundness of the certificates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the chancery court's dismissal of the taxpayer's complaint.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the landowners' position and entered an order declaring that no proof would be received concerning the physical characteristics of the land not being taken.The court stated that the market value of a tract of land could not be determined simply by estimating the amount of stone or other mineral that it contained and then multiplying that estimate by a fixed price per unit. The court found that good cause existed for the discovery order. The highway commission was entitled to an order permitting it to enter upon the property owners' land for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of mineral deposits therein.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment of annexation, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The landowners could not assert the invalidity of the city's annexation ordinance because they stipulated to its validity at the trial lever. The ordinance did not implicate Ark. Const. amend. 14, which applied to the General Assembly and not to municipalities. Although the city's first amended petition was void because it added territory to that described in the original petition, the trial court did not consider the void amended petition, and the petition considered by the trial court did not add territory. Evidence supported the trial court's findings that the petition's map and property description were sufficiently accurate and that the city was financially able to furnish services to the annexed territory. The exclusion of areas of unincorporated land lying completely within the incorporated territory did not destroy the contiguity of the territory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, operator and employer, sought review of the part of a judgment from the Conway Circuit Court (Arkansas) in favor of appellee relatives with respect to their claims for damages for mental anguish suffered as a result of the deaths of four persons in an automobile accident involving a truck driven by the operator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four persons were killed in an automobile accident. The representatives of their estates brought actions seeking recovery of compensatory and punitive damages. In addition, actions were brought pursuant to 1957 Ark. Acts 255 (Act 255) seeking recovery for mental anguish suffered by the relatives of the deceased persons. The trial court entered judgments for the estates covering medical and funeral expenses, property damage, and pain and suffering. The trial court also entered judgments in favor of 11 relatives for mental anguish. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to one relative. The court ruled that Act 255 was constitutional and allowed recovery for mental anguish. The court set aside and dismissed the trial court's judgment as to four relatives because they were not &quot;next of kin&quot; within the meaning of Act 255 and as to two relatives because they suffered no mental anguish. The court ruled that parents, brothers, and sisters were not &quot;next of kin&quot; under Act 255 if there were a living spouse or children of the deceased. The court found the verdicts grossly excessive as to four relatives and conditioned affirmance on the acceptance of remittiturs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of one relative with respect to her claim for damages for mental anguish. The court indicated that it would affirm the trial court's judgments in favor of four relatives if remittiturs were entered for the amounts stated by the court, otherwise, the judgments would be reversed and the causes remanded. The court set aside and dismissed the trial court's judgment in favor of six relatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county treasurer appealed from a judgment of the Crittenden Chancery Court (Arkansas), which declared that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-1520 (1947) was invalid and enjoined its enforcement. Appellee professional fortune teller filed suit to enjoin the county treasurer from collecting a privilege tax of $ 100 per week on the basis that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fortune teller argued that the privilege tax was so high as to demonstrate legislative intent to prohibit rather than regulate, and that the statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The fortune teller had engaged in her trade for more than two years in the county. Initially, when her income exceeded $ 200 per week she paid the privilege tax. However, several others started business across the river in Memphis. Her income declined to $ 50 per week. She contended that the tax destroyed her right to engage in a lawful calling. On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed. There was no common right to engage in fortune telling as a vocation, and other states had held that fortune telling could be barred entirely in the exercise of the state's police power. Hence the legislature could certainly levy a tax effectively preventing fortune telling for profit. In enacting the tax it must have known that a weekly assessment of $ 100 would effectively prohibit the practice in smaller communities, and hence it was undoubtedly intended to prohibit as well as regulate the vocation. The fortune teller had no constitutional basis to challenge the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the chancery court's judgment finding the statute unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement by the county treasurer.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed defendants' convictions. The court held that the witness was an accomplice in the crime because she could have been charged as an accessory after the fact because she had full knowledge that the crime was committed and harbored defendants after the commission of the crime. The court found that the only evidence connecting defendants to the crime was the testimony of the witness. Accordingly, the court held that defendants' convictions were improper pursuant to Ark. Stats. &sect; 43-2116, which provided that a conviction for a felony could not be had upon the testimony of an accomplice, unless the accomplice's testimony was corroborated by other evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1958 Ark. Acts 10 required applicants for employment in any of the state's public schools to provide an affidavit giving names and addresses of all organizations and associations to which they belonged within the past five years.

Appellants alleged that the Act was subject to being used in an unconstitutional manner. The Attorney General and a state senator testified that the Act was intended as a weapon against subversion; however, the court found such expressions were not competent to show legislative intention and created no doubt about the validity of the act. The director of an organization testified that his organization and similar ones meant to gain access to the affidavits with a view to eliminating teachers who belonged or contributed to organizations opposed by it.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Commissioner of Revenues appealed from the decision of the Pulaski Chancery Court, Second Division (Arkansas), which held that a tax was wrongfully and illegally collected and ordered it to be refunded to appellee company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company derived the subject income from the purchase and sale of a large number of shares of stock in a Louisiana gas company. The company filed an income tax return, excluding the extrastate gain but reporting an income tax liability. The commission notified the company that the gain was subject to Arkansas income tax. The company paid the determined amount under protest and filed a complaint. The lower court found that the tax was illegally collected and ordered in to be refunded. On appeal, the issue presented was whether the company, which was a domestic corporation, was obligated to pay state income taxes on earnings derived from without the state under the provisions of the State Income Tax Act, Ark. Stats. &sect; 84-2001 et seq. The court agreed with the lower court that it was not obligated to pay the tax. In similar cases, courts held that such tax exactions were illegal and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States as a taking of property without due process. The court found the decree must be sustained on constitutional ground in conformity with these former decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decree entered in favor of the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the judgment of the Pulaski Chancery Court, First Division (Arkansas), which sustained a demurrer filed by appellee members of a county board of election commissioners and a school board in the taxpayer's declaratory judgment action seeking an interpretation of two new statutes affecting the public schools, Act 248, 1959 Ark. Gen. Assembly and Act 9, 1958 Ark. Gen. Assembly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a teacher. She filed a declaratory judgment action against the members, seeking an interpretation of the two new statutes affecting the public schools. Act 248, 1959 Ark. Gen. Assembly dealt with the timing of annual school elections. Act 9, 1958 Ark. Gen. Assembly established a procedure for recalling school directors. The trial court entered a decree construing both statutes in a manner contrary to the taxpayer's contentions. The taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly construed Act 248, 1959 Ark. Gen. Assembly. The court reasoned that the trial court was entitled to disregard words in the statute's title that the legislature neglected to change when the corresponding language in the body of the measure was deleted by amendment. The court also found that replacements for recalled school directors under Act 9, 1958 Ark. Gen. Assembly did not have to be appointed by the governor under Ark. Const. amend. 29. However, the court reversed the portion of the trial court's judgment construing Act 9, 1958 Ark. Gen. Assembly. The court explained that a replacement's term did not only last until the next regular annual school election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment sustaining the members' demurrer to the taxpayer's challenge to the act dealing with the timing of elections. However, the court reversed the portion of judgment sustaining the members' demurrer with respect to the act contemplating the recall of school directors and remanded the case with directions to overrule the demurrer.</SPAN></P>

Act No. 85 required all persons who collected any money for any lobbying the federal government in regard to school legislation to file reports with the Commission. The court affirmed the lower court's decree in part and reversed it in part. The court held that (1) &sect;&sect; 2 and 3 of the Act 83 were invalid because Ark. Const. art.

The finance corporation was organized under the provisions of the Act and proposed to lend money to an industrial development corporation. The citizen commenced an action seeking a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional and that the finance corporation was illegally organized. The citizen alleged that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 1 and Ark. Const. amend. 13, which provided that the State was prohibited from lending credit. On appeal, the court held that the State did not lend credit merely by authorizing the finance corporation to fund industrial development corporations. The court found that the finance corporations were under the control of the banking department. Additionally, the court held that the citizen did not have the right to question the finance corporation's existence through declaratory judgment proceedings because he had no legally protectable interest.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that domestic violence was impending, and that a general, suitable, and efficient educational system could not be maintained in the school district because of integration of the races in such schools. The citizen filed an unsuccessful complaint challenging the constitutionality of Act 4 and for a mandatory injunction directing the governor to vacate and nullify the proclamation. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that Act 4 did not necessarily violate the state of U.S. constitution, but noted that an Act that was constitutional on its face could become unconstitutional in its operation or under changed conditions. The court upheld the constitutionality of Act 4 under the police power of the state legislature, noting that while neither it nor the state legislature could override the U.S. Supreme Court's school integration mandate, the state's local officials had the power to guide a peaceable, safe course for the implementation of school integration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the desegregation of schools, there was such violence at the schools that federal troops were sent in to ensure the students' safety. Despite the presence of the federal troops, there were continuing bomb threats and violence. The legislature passed an act which allowed the governor to temporarily close the schools on the ground that an emergency situation existed. Plaintiffs challenged the act, alleging that it violated both the federal constitution and Ark. Const. art. 14, &sect; 1, which required the state to provide an education to its children. The court held that the act was valid because the state had a right to enact legislation as a means of protecting the health and safety of its citizens. This was true even where the legislation would have been unconstitutional at other times. The existence of the emergency in the danger to the students gave validity to the legislature's exercise of the state's police power. As evidence of the true extent of the emergency existing within Arkansas' schools, the court highlighted the fact that the federal government had found that such an emergency existed that it needed to deploy its troops to the schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff milk product association (CAMPA) appealed a decree of the Sebastian Chancery Court, Fort Smith District (Arkansas), sustaining the demurrers of defendant retail grocery stores because 1955 Ark. Acts 380, Ark. Stats. &sect; 70-701-707 did not apply to the sale of milk by the stores and was unconstitutional. The CAMPA had petitioned to enjoin the stores from selling milk at retail at any price below what the milk cost it plus 4 percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigation questioned the application of &sect; 70-701-707, which dealt with the price to be charged for milk. Members of the CAMPA were dairy farmers who sold raw milk to processors who, in turn, sold the processed milk to retail grocery stores at wholesale for resale, at retail prices, to ultimate consumers. The CAMPA sought to invoke the provisions of &sect; 70-701-707. The issue on appeal was whether a retail grocery store was engaged in distributing milk within the meaning of &sect; 70-701-707. Reading &sect; 70-701-707 as a whole and particularly because of its many provisions that could not be reconciled with any other view, the court, on review, was driven to conclude that &sect; 70-701-707 was not meant to apply to the sale of milk by the stores and consequently did not mean for the word distributor to include such stores. A distributor was engaged in a separate and distinct business from that of the stores. The court found it unnecessary to render any opinion on the constitutionality of &sect; 70-701-707.</SPAN></P>

If amend. 34 applied to public employees it could not be doubted that 1957 Ark. Acts 30 was unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ark. Const. amend. 34 required that no person be denied employment because of union membership. 1957 Ark. Acts 30 required that persons be denied employment as policemen because of membership in a labor union. The conflict was irreconcilable; the Act must fall unless it could be said that public employment was not within the purview of Ark. Const. amend. 34. On appeal, the court saw no compelling reason to believe that the people intended to exclude public employment from the unequivocal command of amend. 34. The court also was not convinced that the bare fact of union membership presented such a threat to the public welfare that an implied exception must be written into the unqualified language of amend. 34. It seemed clear that the suggested exception was not intended.</SPAN></P>

Appellee wife claimed that jurisdiction was lacking. Finding that 1957 Ark. Acts 36, which substituted residence for domicile as a jurisdictional requirement, was unconstitutional, the Crittenden Chancery Court (Arkansas) dismissed the suit because the husband was not domiciled in Arkansas. The husband sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed for divorce some three months after he moved to an Arkansas town in order to commute to work in a neighboring state. Although 1957 Ark. Acts 36 abandoned &quot;domicile&quot; as a jurisdictional requirement for divorce cases, the chancellor found such act to be unconstitutional and therefore dismissed the suit because the husband had not established Arkansas as his domicile. The husband appealed. The court reversed, holding that 1957 Ark. Acts 36 constitutionally established &quot;residence&quot; as the jurisdictional requirement for divorce cases. First, the Full Faith and Credit Clause dealt only with the extent to which a divorce decree was entitled to recognition elsewhere. It did not purport to say that a divorce decree was not valid in the state where rendered; still less did it intimate that courts could not be authorized to act at all in the absence of proof of domicile.Second, the Due Process Clause did not compel the court to say that 1957 Ark. Acts 36 was arbitrary. In this respect, due process did not require domicile to be the sole basis for the exercise of jurisdiction over the marriage relationship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In substance, the petition asserted that the ballot title was so incomplete and so abbreviated that it failed to convey sufficient information to enable an elector to vote upon the measure with intelligence and understanding. The issue was whether this ballot title met the requirements of the constitution. The court held unanimously that this ballot title failed to supply the voter with the information that the constitution expected him to have. In so deciding, the court noted that it really was not enough to say that the proposed commission would have equal status with the other branches of the state government; the amendment contemplated that every other department would be subservient to the commission. Nor was the private citizen to be left untouched by the unlimited powers of the commission, as it could question anyone about anything. The court also noted that a change in the election laws was a requirement that an applicant for registration give his or her date of birth and exact age in years, months, and days. The court reasoned that a substantial number of men and women would forego their right to vote rather than comply with this requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city was forced to enlarge, overhaul, and repair the disposal system and caused bonds to be issued to finance the project. The bonds were to be financed by a sewer service charge based on consumption. The company sought to enjoin the city from collecting the charges and the trial court found in favor of the city. In affirming, the court held that the city's agreement was ultra vires insofar as it would have estopped the city the right and power to enforce collection of sewer charges against the company. The city not only had the right in exercising its legislative and governmental functions, but it had a duty to do so and could not contract away such right. The court further held that there was no error in denying to the city the penalties and attorney's fees as provided in Ark. Stat. &sect; 19-4113 (1947).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the direct appeal by the company and reversed the cross appeal by the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an order that found the justice of the peace guilty of contempt of court, the justice of the peace sought review of the decision. The justice of the peace argued that the chancery court did not have jurisdiction to enjoin the justice of the peace from proceeding with the trial of the cases against the resident and others. The court found that the chancery court was without jurisdiction to enjoin the justice of the peace from proceeding with the trial of the case pending in the justice of the peace court. Therefore, the court reasoned that the chancery court was without jurisdiction to punish the justice of the peace for contempt in proceeding with the litigation. Reasoning, the court found that the resident had not shown that he was entitled to the injunction. The court held that the mere fact that the resident sought a declaratory judgment in addition to an injunction did not give the chancery court jurisdiction to grant the injunction.</SPAN></P>

In order to finance the demand for additional water, the City passed an ordinance imposing higher rates. The ordinance provided that the rates for nonresidents would be 25 percent more than for residents residing within the City limits. The nonresidents and a tourist center initiated actions, which challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance. The parties alleged that the ordinance violated due process principles and the equal protection clause. The trial court entered a consolidated judgment for the nonresidents and the tourist center. In reversing the decision, the court found that the City could make a discrimination as to rates based solely upon its boundaries. The City's first duty was to its inhabitants. The variation between rates was justified based upon the increased costs the City incurred supplying water to nonresidents. The greater the distance from the waterworks system, the greater the costs that the City incurred. In less densely populated areas, the City had to pay increased costs for the installation and maintenance of water mains and in the pumping of water.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was extremely difficult to specify each act that would constitute a fire hazard and that there was clear legislative authority for the enactment of the ordinance. The court further found that the authority to determine what conditions constituted a fire hazard was properly with the fire department and that, under its police power, a municipal corporation had full authority to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizenry. The court also found that criminal intent was not a necessary element of the offense, that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict, and that the testimony of fire department officials regarding the condition of defendant's premises, and that they had talked with him relative to same was admissible to show that defendant was familiar with the nature of conditions considered a fire hazard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix contended that operation of the airport was a proprietary function of the municipality, because, inter alia, it sold petroleum products to the general public, and operated at a net profit with income derived from rentals, cafe operation, and other activities of a proprietary nature. The trial court, however, determined that operation and maintenance of the airport was a governmental function for which it was not liable to respond in damages, and sustained the municipality's demurrer based thereupon. On appeal, the court affirmed, because those jurisdictions holding that operation of airports was proprietary, had also held that electric plants, waterworks, and swimming pools were proprietary in nature, while Arkansas courts had held such operations to be governmental. Furthermore, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 74-601 to 74-620 construed as a whole demonstrated that the legislature intended that operation of a municipal airport be a governmental function. Such a determination was a proper function of the legislature, and not of the courts, and exemption of municipalities from tort liability was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which held that operation of a municipal airport was a proprietary function, and that the municipality was therefore not liable for damages resulting from the explosion.</SPAN></P>

The court recognized that the doctrine of sovereign immunity prohibited persons like the employee from bringing actions against the county. However, the court said, Ark.

Act 115 directed that the wages were to be based upon wages determined by the Secretary of Labor of the United States to be prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the particular area of Arkansas where the work was to be performed. The Arkansas Department of Labor adopted rules and regulations under the Act. The taxpayer unsuccessfully sought a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional.

Act 115 and the unauthorized related state rules and regulations were unconstitutional and void. By impermissibly delegating the state's legislative authority to determine local wage rates to an agency of the United States government over which the state had no control, the Act violated Ark. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 1, 2 and Ark. Const. amend. VII. The vague Act's local and special effect was discriminatory and violated Ark. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

The citizens brought this action for a declaratory judgment regarding the constitutionality of the Arkansas Industrial Development Act, 1955 Ark. Acts 404.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act provided, inter alia, for the organization of corporations to bring new industrial plants to communities in the state and authorized the state to purchase bonds issued by those corporations. The complaint alleged that the corporation, proceeding under the Act was about to issue industrial development bonds secured by a mortgage on land and heavy industrial machinery; that the Commission had approved the project under the Act; and that the Board of Finance had authorized the state's purchase of one-half of the bond issue. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 20 of the Act, which provided that any city, town, or county in the state could purchase membership in a local industrial development corporation organized under the provisions of the Act, violated Ark. Const. amend. 13, which provided that no municipality could grant financial aid toward the construction of private enterprises operated by any person, firm or corporation. The court also ruled that &sect; 36 of the Act, which exempted the bonds issued under the Act from taxation, violated Ark. Const. art. 15, &sect; 6, which provided that laws exempting property from taxation, other than as provided in the Constitution, were void.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Assembly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tax assessor petitioned the county court to employ professional appraisers to place a value on all real property within the county. The appraisals aid him in assessing the property for ad valorem taxes. The county court ordered three property owners to enter into negotiations for the employment of qualified appraisers to appraise all real property in the county. The owners named in the order negotiated a contract with a company for the appraisal of all the real estate, and the county court approved the contract. The taxpayers sought to enjoin the county court from proceeding under Act 351. The court held that the county court had exclusive jurisdiction over the expenditure of county funds. Ark. Const. &sect; 5, art. 16 gave the general assembly the authority to require the schools to pay their pro rata share of the costs of assessing property, a portion of could be applied to the expenses of employing professional appraisers. Because a school district had assumed the obligation of paying its pro rata share of the cost of the appraisal, it was not improper for it to make an advancement to the county general fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged act created the Commission and authorized it to finance and construct a state justice building through the issuance of bonds funded through rental of space in the building. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court also found that the funds designated by the act were &quot;cash funds,&quot; controlled by the legislature, that need not be paid into the state treasury nor specifically appropriated. The court found that the bonds to be issued were not obligations of the state, but were solely and exclusively the obligations of the Commission. Because the state was not lending its credit and was not issuing any interest-bearing treasury warrants or scrip, the provisions of the state constitution were not invaded. With reference to the additional costs levied by the Act, the court found no violation of Ark. Const. amend. XX. The only obligations of the state with reference to the bonds were in reference to clearly designated special funds. The court agreed that the section of the act that exempted the bonds from all property taxes was unconstitutional and severed it while affirming the Act's validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner resident challenged the decision of the Miller Chancery Court, Second Division (Arkansas), which held that respondent city's Ordinance B-866 that regulated heavy traffic on certain streets was valid in the resident's action that sought to enjoin the city from enforcing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident alleged that he would suffer irreparable damage if the ordinance were enforced because the trucks he used to operate his business were too heavy to travel on the city's streets under the ordinance. Moreover, the resident contended that the enforcement of the ordinance would essentially ruin his business. On appeal, the court held that the first issue was whether &sect; 1 of the ordinance, which prohibited the use of trucks of over one-half ton capacity on certain streets, was valid. The court held that the city had the power to pass ordinances that regulated the weight of the trucks that traveled on the city's streets. The second issue on appeal was whether or not the ordinance was unreasonable or arbitrary. The court held that under the fact and circumstances in the case, it could not state that the ordinance was unreasonable or arbitrary. Moreover, the court held that it was not justified in holding that trial court's decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant manufacturer challenged a judgment of the Independence Chancery Court (Arkansas), which refused to enjoin appellee retailer from selling an antifreeze product to its customers for one dollar less per gallon than it mandated on the ground that the Arkansas Fair Trade Act, Ark. Stats. &sect;&sect; 70-201 through 70-208, violated Ark. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 2, 8, 18, 19, and 29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer produced the antifreeze product, which it sold under a trade name. Under the Act it contended it had the right to require all retailers in Arkansas to sell the product to consumers for a certain price. The retailer contended that the Act, since its adoption, was rendered void because similar acts had been held in conflict with the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and that to be effective, the Act had to be re-enacted. The court found that there was no federal question. It further noted that the manufacturer had an agreement with one retailer in Arkansas to sell the product at a certain price, which under the terms of the Act, bound every other retailer in Arkansas to sell at the same price. The court limited its consideration of the Act to Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 8. The court affirmed the judgment. The Act gave the manufacturer the absolute right to fix the price at which the product had to be sold to the consuming public in Arkansas without regard to the cost of manufacture or distribution. However, the Act was not to protect the public welfare and therefore it violated the Arkansas Constitution because it impaired the contractual right, a property right, of the retailer.</SPAN></P>
