</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the unfavorable judgment of a single justice in the trial court (Maine), which denied him relief from a 1957 conviction of the crime of arson upon plea of guilty to such charge and left standing the ensuing sentence to prison for a term of not less than 50 years and not more than 100 years. At the time of the hearing of the post-conviction habeas corpus, defendant was on parole from the aforementioned sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed and asserted error on the part of the Justice in the habeas corpus proceeding for not recognizing the fatal insufficiency of the information. The court noted that the issue of the voluntariness and knowledgeability of the plea was further complicated by the fact that no record existed concerning the original information proceeding in which defendant's plea of guilty and judgment of conviction were entered. Because of this omission, defendant initially claimed automatic entitlement to have his plea and conviction set aside. The court noted that the burden of proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence rested on defendant and that all findings of fact by the justice in the post conviction proceeding stood unless &quot;clearly erroneous. The court deemed that the municipal court complaint was consent evidence since it was a statement under oath by a state investigator since deceased that had some probative value. Defendant failed to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that his plea of guilty to nighttime arson, with advice of counsel, was not voluntary and intelligent. Defendant's appeal was rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In actions seeking declaratory judgments from the court (Maine), plaintiff oil pipe line corporation and 10 major oil companies sought determinations that the Coastal Conveyance Act, 38 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 572, &sect;&sect; 541-557 (1969), was unconstitutional because its use of licensing revenue was inconsistent with those specified in Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 19, and that the statute violated the due process constitutional guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff oil pipe line corporation and 10 major oil companies sought declaratory judgments that the Coastal Conveyance Act (CCA), 38 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 572, &sect;&sect; 541-557 (1969), was unconstitutional. The CCA charged those who discharged oil into or upon coastal waters and adjoining land with cleaning up the spill to the satisfaction of defendant state commission, which was empowered to clean up spills by persons unknown. To effectuate the later cleanups, an annual license fee was imposed on the basis of one-half cent per barrel of petroleum products transferred each licensing period. A lower court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the arbitration and vicarious liability provisions of the statute pending a determination of their constitutionality. In passing on the constitutionality of the CCA, the state's highest court held that neither the payments for costs of spills for which the pipe line corporation and oil companies were vicariously liable nor the license fees violated the due process guarantees of the state or federal constitutions. It also held that the CCA did not violate the Import-Export Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the statute as construed violated no provision of either the state or federal constitutions, the court held that the challenges to its constitutionality brought by plaintiff oil pipe line corporation and 10 major oil companies must fail. The court found that the license fee was not imposed on imports or exports and that the statute properly empowered an administrative agency with discretionary fact-finding functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Superior Court of Penobscot County (Maine) for selling amphetamines, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 2210. Defendant alleged the sentence violated his constitutional rights because tit. 22, &sect; 2210 prescribed a generalized maximum sentence of two years but, because of his age, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34, &sect; 802 he was exposed to a potentially longer period of confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 19 years old at the time of sentencing. He was sentenced to the Men's Correctional Center to an indeterminate sentence not to exceed three years under the provisions of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 34, &sect; 802. The trial court could have sentenced him to the state prison or to jail for a definite term within a maximum of two years under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 2215. Defendant alleged the sentence violated his due process and equal protection rights. The court affirmed finding there were significant rational differences within the generalized sphere of the avowedly criminally penal (in contrast to the non-criminal juvenile delinquency) approach to law violators. These differences render constitutionally tolerable the demarcation of such special class of young criminal offenders to be subject to longer confinement but under different conditions and terms than a defendant would undergo in an ordinary prison. The special rehabilitation and correctional features of the penal functioning of the Men's Correctional Center yielded, for purposes of sentencing alternatives, a rational differentiation between the Center and an ordinary jail or the Maine State Prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher association brought an action against defendant board of education pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 80B, asking that defendant be ordered to comply with the determination of arbitrators empaneled under the Municipal Employees Labor Relations Law, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 965(4), and that it be enjoined from continuing to refuse to do so. Defendant also brought a Me. R. Civ. P. 80B action, alleging that the award was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a contract, plaintiff teacher association and defendant board of education resorted to the arbitration provision of the Municipal Employees Labor Relation Law, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 965(4). Plaintiff filed a complaint under Me. R. Civ. P. 80B, asking that defendants be ordered to comply with the determination of the arbitration. Defendant's Me. R. Civ. P. 80B action alleged that the award was invalid. The supreme judicial court held that the arbitrators exceeded their statutory jurisdiction in their determination as to class size, length of a teacher's working day, scheduling and length of school vacations, and of the commencement of the school year. The legislature's attempt to delegate to arbitrators binding determination of labor disputes between plaintiff and defendant was void for lack of adequate standards, but the provisions concerning arbitration were severable from the remainder of the statute, and there was no constitutional infirmity in the other obligations of collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme judicial court remanded the case to the lower court to modify the decision of the arbitrators by striking the determinations regarding class size, length of a teacher's working day, scheduling and length of school vacations, and the commencement of the school year, and then to affirm the decision, holding that the arbitrators exceeded their statutory jurisdiction as to these matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter was before the court on a report ordered by the Superior Court, York County (Maine) pursuant to Me. R. Crim. P. 37A(b) stating that its denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment ought to be determined by the law court before any further proceedings were taken. The indictment charged defendant with first degree arson in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 161.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree arson in connection with the burning of the dwelling house that belonged to his wife. He claimed that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 161, et seq., was unconstitutionally vague, that it was of no effect in view of the wording of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 163, and that it was not a crime for a husband to burn his own or his wife's property. The court determined that the true issue was whether &sect; 161, providing that setting a fire to a dwelling house was arson in the first degree, was superseded by implication by the enactment of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 163, which provided that the burning of any personal or real property of whatsoever class was arson in the third degree. It then found that the omission in &sect; 163 of the words &quot;not included or described in &sect; 161 or &sect; 162&quot; was the result of a scribal omission and was intended to read as if the words had been included. Further, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 165, was to be interpreted as resting on a legislative premise that a husband was guilty of criminal conduct when he burned any of the property described in &sect; 165, regardless of whether it be he or his wife who held the legal title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds that (1) the trial court in denying his motion to suppress items found in search of a c-defendant's apartment, (2) N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 594, &sect; 2 under which he was detained, was unconstitutional, (3) the out-of-court identification procedure employed by the police violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and his Fifth Amendment right to due process of law, and (4) the denial of his pretrial motion for a separate trial was error. In denying the appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err in finding that the consent to the search of the apartment was not the product of coercion or duress. Further, defendant showed no prejudice in his trial in Maine that resulted from the acts of New Hampshire authorities. Also, a post-arrest pretrial photographic identification did not require the presence of counsel, and the evidence did not raise an issue of suggestivity in the identification.

Plaintiff pleaded guilty to a two-count information regarding the jail escape. In his habeas petition, plaintiff alleged that the superior court was without jurisdiction to act on an allegedly invalid information and that his plea of guilty was ineffective. The court concluded that the information alleged a lawful detention for intoxication and that the reference to the wrong statute for the probation officer's request to hold plaintiff in custody did not effect the pleading requirements of the criminal rules.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The junkyard sought reimbursement from the city of $ 500 annual license fees it paid under protest in 1968, 1969, and 1970 to obtain a statutory permit and avoid criminal penalties.

Upon review, the court faulted the distinction made by the statute between identical businesses, based solely on their proximity to a highway, finding an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection of the laws under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Me. Const. art. IV, pt. 3d, &sect; 1. Such a distinction was arbitrary because the parties stipulated that the local and state cost of printing permit applications, posting and publishing notices, maintaining municipal records, and policing and patrolling the areas in which automobile graveyards or junkyards were located were identical, no matter how close to a highway the businesses were located.

P. 16 necessarily rested upon its own facts, particularly with respect to reasonableness of the specific request and the safeguards properly imposed by the trial court and that defendant was required to support the reasonableness of the request by affidavit and not merely a conclusory assertion thereof, which defendant failed to do. The court found that, in light of the small portion of the drug remaining after the State's test, the trial court properly refused to release it and ordered merely that the State provide an independent expert to review the State's testing and laboratory procedures. The court held that the evidence sufficiently identified the sample as the one sold by defendant, that the State's witnesses were adequately sequestered, and that defendant's rights were not prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful homicide under such circumstances as to constitute murder. While the case was pending for trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress his palm prints, which he claimed were improperly and unlawfully obtained by the State. Defendant also sought to enjoin the State from using the evidence before the grand jury or in any other proceeding. Upon review, the court denied defendant's motion to suppress his palm prints. The court held that the taking of defendant's palm print subsequent to his arrest for speeding was authorized under &sect;1542. The court stated that it construed the word &quot;fingerprints,&quot; under &sect; 1542, to include palm prints. Further, the court disagreed that speeding was not a &quot;crime,&quot; as that term was used in &sect; 1542. The court ruled that fingerprinting of a person validly in custody was not conduct considered as a search protected by the Fourth Amendment. As to a second palm print taken, the court ruled that the print was admissible because it was taken while defendant was in custody pursuant to a valid seizure of his person and detention under the warrant. The third palm print was lawfully taken incident to defendant's arrest for murder.</SPAN></P>

It was within the state's police power to delegate regulatory authority over environmental protection matters to a statewide commission. Appellant's ownership of its property was subject to reasonable restraints seeking to ensure the maintenance of air, soil, and water quality. Since the commission was legally authorized to issue the order, and since that order did not constitute an undue restraint upon appellant's use of its property, the order was a validly enforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in allowing evidence of an uncharged theft of a car and in refusing to grant a mistrial based upon the prosecutor's contact with a juror and his comment on defendant's failure to testify. In sustaining the appeal, the court ruled that, while an inference of prejudice arose from the conversation with the juror, it was rebutted by clear and convincing proof that the lunchtime encounter was entirely inadvertent and did not involve the trial. The court held that the testimony regarding the theft of the car from the crime scene, in addition to the check-writing machine listed in the indictment, was properly admitted as relevant and material proof of the time of the theft and the intent and purpose of the illegal entry. The court found that the prosecutor responded to defendant's inference that certain witnesses not called by the State would have corroborated the defense but that the prosecutor went too far in observing, not simply that the witnesses were also available to defendant, but that he, as the possible perpetrator knew more than even the investigator, which was an impermissible comment on defendant's failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs and the commission argued that the &sect; 305 complaint should be dismissed because it was premature. The court concluded that it had equity jurisdiction to decide the constitutional challenges asserted in defendant's &sect; 305 complaint and that the subject matter was ripe for judicial determination. Plaintiffs and the commission next argued that defendant's appeal waived its concurrent right to pursue a &sect; 305 complaint. The court disagreed because the complaint provided a broader latitude of judicial scrutiny than the appeal. Defendant's motion for the taking of additional evidence was granted.

In each case, it was alleged that the juvenile was living in circumstances of manifest danger of falling into habits of vice or immorality, a violation of &sect; 2552. Petitioners attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 2552 insofar as it purported to give jurisdiction to juvenile courts to treat as a juvenile offender a juvenile whose conduct was described as living in circumstances of manifest danger of falling into the habits of vice and immortality. Petitioners contended that the offense under &sect; 2552 was unconstitutionally vague and denied petitioners' due process and equal protection. The court denied the writs of habeas corpus, holding that &sect; 2552 was not unconstitutionally vague because the meaning of &quot;living in circumstance of manifest danger of falling into habits of vice and immorality&quot; was clear when considered in light of the history and purpose of the juvenile laws.

The council sustained the building inspector's decision, and the owners subsequently sought superior court review pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 80B(a). The court answered the superior court in the negative, concluding that the owners had demonstrated by the standard required that there was no rational relationship between the storage of flammable liquids in automobile service stations and the prevention of fire in places of public assembly. The court determined that &quot;clear and irrefragable&quot; evidence, uncontradicted, established the lack of a rational relationship between the evil sought to be abated and the method adopted to do so.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the appeal. In so doing, the court held that it was inappropriate that the jury had any function to decide the evidentiary admissibility of a confession. It was clearly unsound in principle, created serious practical dangers, and was unnecessary to give adequate protection to defendant. The court determined, however, that by submitting the issue to the jury, accompanied by an instruction that the jury was to have determined the issue on the basis of proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence, the presiding justice had given defendant more than the sound public policy of the State warranted. For that reason, the procedure itself, or error, if any, in the charge as a subsidiary incident of the over-all procedure, was not obvious error or error affecting substantial rights, and therefore, was not error so highly prejudicial and calculated to have resulted in injustice that an unjust verdict inevitably resulted. Additionally, evidence supported the conclusion that defendant was guilty beyond all reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

No appeal was taken from the conviction. The court rejected the prisoner's claim that failure by the trial Justice and defense counsel to notify him of his right to appeal from the conviction and sentence presented grounds for post-conviction relief. It was only when a felon was sentenced to the Maine State Prison that the court was required to notify him of his right to appeal to the appellate division of the Supreme Judicial Court for the purpose of having his sentence reviewed. The court also rejected the prisoner's claim that his counsel was incompetent: Findings to the contrary by the trial judge were fully supported by the record. Finally, the court held that the trial court's failure to make specific findings on certain points in the petition was not error because the prisoner had not requested such findings, and specific findings were only required when a petitioner requested them pursuant to Me.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the juvenile delinquency statute, 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2552, was unconstitutional. The court did not reach the constitutional issue, however, because it found that the superior court was without jurisdiction to give the sentence imposed and that the case had become moot during the pendency of the appeal. 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2611(4) provided, as one of the powers of disposition of the juvenile court, which were granted to the superior court on appeal pursuant to 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2665, the commitment of the juvenile to the Men's or Women's Correctional Center. 15 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2611(4) had been repealed, effective April 21, 1969. The statute was re-enacted without change, effective September 23, 1971. Thus, on July 1, 1971, the superior court was without power to commit a juvenile offender to the Men's Correctional Center. The order of commitment was, therefore, invalid. Furthermore, defendant had attained the age of 18 years during the pendency of the appeal. Thus, he was beyond the age when he could be treated as a juvenile offender, and his commitment was only for the term of his minority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeal, vacated the order for commitment, and quashed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially tried in the district court for battery and sentenced to 30 days in jail. Thereafter, he appealed to the superior court and received a trial de novo. A jury convicted defendant of assault, and he was sentenced to 60 days. Defendant appealed, arguing that the heavier sentence he received upon retrial was unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The imposition of a more severe sentence after reconviction violated due process principles only if it were imposed as purposeful punishment for defendant's having engaged in an appeal; the ultimate result of such a practice would be to chill the use of the appeal process. However, the range of penalties provided by law for misdemeanors was the same whether defendant were found guilty in the district court or in the superior court, following an appeal by exercising his right to be tried de novo in the superior court. Thus, although his sentence was greater after the trial de novo, it was not unconstitutional because it still fell within the statutory range for the crime. The court remanded for resentencing because defendant was erroneously convicted of assault and battery; a battery charge was dismissed before trial.</SPAN></P>

The police officer arrived just as two persons were leaving the scene by ambulance for the hospital. At the scene, the police officer found a badly damaged vehicle. The police officer commenced a search of the vehicle. The officer found a jacket bearing defendant's name and, in the pocket of the jacket, the police officer found barbituric acid and amphetamines. At no time was defendant's vehicle impounded, nor was there ever an inventory search thereof. The trial court denied defendant's requests for suppression of the evidence found in the vehicle. Defendant was convicted of possessing barbituric acid and amphetamines, a felony in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 2210. On review, the court sustained defendant's appeal. The court held that the drugs were found by the police officer as the result of a search conducted in violation of U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV. Accordingly, the court concluded that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence, and excluded it as evidence against defendant. The court concluded that the error was prejudicial to defendant and, thus, constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>

P. 35(a) for correction of his sentence was referred to the court for determination of whether he was entitled to credit against his life sentence for time served in the county jail pending appeal of his conviction prior to the imposition of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of his motion, the inmate argued that Me. Rev. Stat.

In granting relief, the court determined that, while the motion under Me. R. Crim. P. 35(a) was untimely, jurisdiction existed to provide post-conviction relief through &quot;declaratory judgment&quot; under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5951 et seq., which was more appropriate for the inmate's claim than the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; procedures pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5502 et seq. The court, while refraining from considering the constitutional issues because of the possible implications of retroactive application of new legal principles, confined its consideration to the specific application to the inmate's case of adoption of Me. R. Crim. P. 32(a) and repeal of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1701. The court granted partial credit for time served from the date of repeal of &sect; 1701 during his stay in the county jail as an adequate remedy for failure to promptly sentence him in accordance with Me.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer stopped a vehicle occupied by defendants and another person. As the officer approached the vehicle, the officer shone a flashlight into the vehicle. The officer saw a rifle with the clip inserted. The officer sought to arrest the person for carrying a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle, a misdemeanor under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 2456. The events that followed were in dispute. Defendants were convicted of two counts of felonious assault and one defendant was convicted of the additional crime of carrying a firearm while engaged in the commission of a felony. In denying the appeal, the court held that defendants' convictions properly rested upon the foundation that both defendants engaged in frustrating the officer's lawful arrest of the person. The court held that the officer lawfully ascertained the existence of the rifle and lawfully knew that a misdemeanor had been and continued to be committed in his presence; hence, the court concluded that the officer then had lawful authority to arrest without a warrant, under Me.

Plaintiff brought suit claiming that the statute was unconstitutional and that its rider form complied with the terms of the act. The statute addressed premium payments during periods when insurance agents, who usually collected the premiums, were on strike. The statute precluded any default to policy holders in the first 30 days after a strike by insurance agents. The federal law clearly allowed some state intervention as the labor issue was peripheral to the statute and not preempted by federal labor law. The court held that the statute was a proper exercise of the police power of the state to protect its citizens while not seriously impairing the company's property rights. The language of the statute was neither vague nor imprecise as it instructed plaintiff to notify its policy holders of how it could pay premiums in the event of a strike in order to avoid a policy lapse.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further claimed prejudicial error in the exclusion of certain testimonial evidence. The court concluded that there was no error in the exclusion of the proffered testimony. Finally, defendant complained of error in the denial of his motion for new trial based on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The court found that the admission of the new evidence would not have changed the verdict of guilt against defendant. In denying the motion, there was no error. The weight and credibility to be attached to the newly discovered evidence was for the trial court and the issue on appeal was whether his decision was clearly wrong.

The ordinance was unconstitutional because it gave the Board discretionary powers and the failed to proscribe the standards by which the discretion was to be exercised.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was paroled after serving part of his sentence for having carnally known a female child of 11 years.

The inmate then initiated a post-conviction habeas corpus proceeding in which he complained that the revocation of his parole was unlawful and in violation of his constitutional rights. The trial court denied his petition. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the case because the petition was filed before the inmate's sentence had expired. However, because the sentence expired before the court's final decision was rendered, the action was moot and deprived the court of any justiciable issue. The court ruled that any possible collateral consequence, which could stem from a record of revocation of parole, such that it might influence a sentencing judge on a subsequent conviction of crime or the parole board in the administration of a future parole, was so minimal, conjectural, and insubstantial, in comparison with the State's interest in bringing the litigation to an end, that it did not justify an exception to the mootness doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the ground that the indictment upon which he was tried was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed, holding that breaking, entering and larceny in the nighttime was a felonious offense under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 2103. The indictment had the caption &quot;Breaking, entering and larceny in the nighttime&quot; but it also had the citation Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 754, which was an incorrect citation for the offense of breaking, entering and larceny in the nighttime, and defined the offense of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony or larceny. While the indictment would have been a completely acceptable charge of violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 2103 if the surplus language was stricken, the inclusion of the additional language combined with the erroneous citation, misled him to his prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery. Defendant's motion for post conviction habeas corpus relief was denied, and defendant appealed the order first contending that the indictment was fatally insufficient. The court held that this argument was meritless. The indictment informed defendant of the charges against him so that he could have mounted a proper defense. Accordingly, it was legally sufficient. Defendant then urged that his guilty plea was automatically vitiated by the failure of the trial court to comply with Me. R. Crim. P. 11. The problem with Rule 11 was the required determination that the trial court in fact conclude that the defendant committed the crime before accepting his guilty plea. The court concluded, however, that failure to make such a record did not render a guilty plea invalid per se. The validity of a guilty plea was to have been ascertained from the totality of the circumstances. In the present case the court held that even assuming some procedural inadequacies with regard to Rule 11, defendant was not entitled to plead anew because based on the totality of the circumstances, his guilty plea was freely and voluntarily given. The appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of littering, and he appealed his conviction. In the superior court, he filed a document captioned as &quot;Motion Rule 12(b)(2),&quot; in which he argued that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 2251 did not reach defendant's conduct, that it was unconstitutional on its face, and that it was unconstitutional if applied to defendant's version of the facts. The superior court invoked Me. R. Crim. P. 37A(a), which authorized it to report proceedings if it was of the opinion that the case involved an important question of law that would dispose of the action, upon condition that counsel stipulate to the report. Finding that there had not been a strict compliance with R. 37(a), the court declined to consider the issues sought to be tendered. Among other things, the court concluded that, in spite of the infirmities in the reporting process, the facts were not, in any case, adequately stated to allow the court to determine whether or not the littering statute was unconstitutional as applied to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sellers of cemetery marker and monuments appealed from a judgment from the superior court (Maine) in favor of defendant city. The superior court concluded that the sellers' complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the city enacted an ordinance limiting the type of markers permitted to be placed in a municipal cemetery and providing that such markers could be purchased, although not exclusively, through the municipal cemetery, and that in this respect the ordinance was ultra vires and placed the city as a seller of these markers in unfair competition with the sellers. The superior court found that municipal cemeteries had a right to engage in the sale of these memorials as an incidental operation of the cemetery. The court held that markers for cemetery lots, however desirable aesthetically, were not &quot;necessary&quot; and were not comparable to water, electricity, fuel, food, and other necessities of life. The city pointed to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 5103, the enabling act under which the ordinance was adopted. Conspicuously absent, however, was any provision authorizing the sale to the public of monuments or markers. The selling of markers could not be viewed as reasonably incidental to the operation or maintenance of a cemetery by a municipality. That was a separate and distinct function appropriately left to private enterprise, which could supply such items.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the sellers' appeal, set aside the judgment for the city, and remanded the case to the superior court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for committing the crime of sodomy. At his first trial, defendant appealed and won a new trial based on prejudicial misinformation being brought to the jury on cross-examination of defendant. Defendant's second trial resulted in a mistrial. Defendant was convicted in the third trial. Defendant appealed. Defendant contended error in the denial of his motion for arrest of judgment and motion for new trial and double jeopardy. The court noted that the issues of the mistrial sought by defendant had nothing to do with jeopardy and that retrial after a successful appeal did not constitute double jeopardy. Defendant also contended that the presiding justice erred in charging the jury that force need not be shown to have been used, although the indictment alleged the use of force as an element of the crime. The court noted that force was not an essential element of the crime of sodomy and consent was no defense to a prosecution for sodomy. The court did hold that Maine courts were to abandon the use of the Tuey-Allen charge in which a trial judge could assist a jury when requesting them to consider a case further. Defendant's appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 4466. On report upon an agreed statement of facts from the Superior Court, County of Lincoln (Maine), defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was fishing for shrimp, and along with the shrimp drew in a number of lobsters. He culled out of the net a few lobsters, intending to retain them for food. He was charged with possession of lobsters on board a boat rigged for otter trawling. After a district court trial found him guilty, defendant appealed. On report from the superior court, the supreme judicial held that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 4466 did not violate due process and equal protection of the laws. The court determined that the &quot;possession&quot; prohibition of the statute achieved a constitutionally valid statutory objective. The possession of lobsters on a boat rigged for otter or beam trawling was rationally related to the constitutionally permissible objective of conserving the lobster fishery in Maine's coastal waters. It was within the legislative province to not create an exception in the statute for the &quot;ancient custom&quot; of fishermen who, while at sea, retained a few fish from their catch for their own use. The court concluded that the statute was constitutional on its face and as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute outlawing the possession of lobsters on board a boat rigged for otter trawling passed constitutional muster.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were husband and wife. They were residents of New Hampshire and the husband worked at a naval shipyard located in Maine. The State of Maine had ceded the shipyard to the federal government in 1863, reserving only the right to serve civil and criminal process on the ceded territory. In 1947, Congress enacted the Buck Act, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 105-110, which granted jurisdiction to the states to levy and collect income taxes from persons receiving income on federal reservations within the geographic boundaries of the taxing state. In 1969, Maine passed an income tax law and the taxpayers filed a joint tax return and sought a refund of the tax assessed. The request was denied. The court rejected the taxpayers' contention that the Buck Act should be construed to mean that a state could tax income only if that state had retained such a right when it ceded the land. Instead, it found that the Buck Act was an effective recession to Maine of the right to levy and collect income taxes from nonresidents working at the naval shipyard. Further, the taxpayers received a sufficient benefit from Maine to justify the imposition of the income tax.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ.

The court ruled that the failure of the State to transcribe the grand jury proceedings and provide defendant with a transcript of grand jury testimony was not a denial of defendant's due process rights because whether a record was kept had no bearing on the grand jury's function, and good cause did not exist to violate the general rule regarding grand jury secrecy. The court also ruled that the in-court identifications were properly admitted to support conviction beyond a reasonable doubt and were not the product of tainted pretrial photographic viewings.

Defendant's second point, however, challenging the sufficiency of the complaint, held merit. The court noted that Me. R. Crim. P. 7(c) required a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. The goal was to have informed defendant of the charge so that he could have mounted an adequate defense. In the instant case the complaint failed to inform either defendant or the trial court as to what acts involving defendant's conduct or language were said to have occurred and to have amounted to disorderly conduct, the ultimate fact.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of two towns accepted a proposal to form a school administrative district. The proposal apportioned the number of directors between the towns. Upon a petition for dissolution of the school district, the vote in favor of dissolution was short of the two-thirds majority required by &sect; 222, and the motion of defendants, district directors and board of education members, to dismiss the complaint was granted. The court denied plaintiffs' appeal, holding that the legislature acted constitutionally in requiring a two-thirds majority vote of approval to render effective a petition for the commencement of procedures for the dissolution of a school administration district. The statutory provisions, which were without actual, or potential, invidiously discriminatory effect against any identifiable class, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause solely because they departed from the concept of strict majoritarian supremacy. The court also concluded that plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to the apportionment of directors was equally without merit because voluntary negotiations among the towns resulted in the representative determination.</SPAN></P>

The issuance and sale of the notes did not violate Me. Const. Art. IX, &sect; 14, when the state would not have to resort to tax revenue to pay the Authority. The issuance and sale of the notes also did not violate Me. Const. Art. IX, &sect; 14, because the legislature only intended to suggest to its successors to fund the project.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a petition for a common law writ of habeas corpus to challenge the constitutionality of Me. Rev.

To be constitutional, &sect; 103 had to meet the strictures of both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and of Me. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife were divorced, and the husband was ordered to pay the wife's attorney's fees. The husband failed to make payment and was detained on a contempt charge. The husband filed an application for habeas corpus relief contending that his detention was violative of his due process rights. The court noted that such detention was authorized by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 722. However, due process of law required that no one be deprived of life, liberty or property without proper notice and an opportunity to be heard. The State argued that &sect; 722 allowed such hearing even though it was post-detention, and the time of the detention period pending such hearing was not unreasonable. However, the problem noted by the court was the absence of consideration as to whether the husband had the requisite ability to pay. This determination was essential and was necessary prior to any detention period. Since &sect; 722 made no such consideration mandatory prior to detention, that portion allowing for detention was specifically declared violative of due process, and as such, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner sought release from an allegedly illegal confinement in county jail. The single justice enlarged the prisoner from jail on his personal recognizance pending final decision of the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was indigent. He was arrested on a capias execution, brought pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 722, for failure to pay a child support obligation. He was jailed until a relative paid the debt. He remained in jail after that because he could not pay the amount due for his board while jailed. Neither of the respondents entered an appearance. In response to the prisoner's motion for judgment by default, the justice required him to present evidence in support of his contentions. After hearing the evidence, the justice reported the matter to the Law Court pursuant to Me. R. Civ. P. 72(a). The court held that the justice had followed the proper procedure under the circumstances. The language of Rule 72(a) authorized a report where all parties appearing so agreed. Petitioner, the only party who had appeared, agreed to the report. Because the capias was issued without prior hearing as to the reason for non-payment, it violated the procedural due process mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment and was null and void. Because the arrest was made pursuant to a void judgment, the incarceration was illegal and the county's claim for the prisoner's board was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss was based on the ground that the enabling act for the town ordinance under which he was prosecuted, Me.

The town's ordinances permitted a licensed resident to harvest an unlimited amount of shellfish, a nonlicensed resident to harvest a limited amount of shellfish, and a licensed nonresident to harvest a limited amount of shellfish. A nonlicensed nonresident had no right to harvest shellfish. The court held that &sect; 4252, which excluded nonresidents from the unlimited harvesting of shellfish while granting such a privilege to licensed residents, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6-A. The authority conferred by Me. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the habeas corpus petition was correctly dismissed because the parents lacked a pre-existing right to custody, and there was available to the parents nothing under specific statutory authorizations pertaining to the adjudication of rights to custody of the minor child. The parents had supplemented the habeas corpus petition with a complaint in equity asking that the lower court adjudicate their right to legal custody.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insureds brought a declaratory judgment action against defendant insurer regarding an automobile insurance policy, which failed to contain uninsured motorist (UM), coverage.

The court held that the trial court was correct in disposing of the case on the issue of statutory interpretation and in concluding 1967 Me. Law 93, lacked the retrospective scope claimed by plaintiffs. The court concluded that the 1967 Me.

The record did not indicate that this finding was clearly erroneous. Finally, petitioner contended that the justice at the habeas corpus hearing erroneously admitted over petitioner's objection testimony of petitioner's former attorney, and of petitioner himself, which dealt with privileged communications between petitioner and his attorney. The court held that in a post-conviction habeas corpus proceeding representations by a petitioner that his plea of guilty was induced by reasons that, if true, would invalidate the plea constituted a waiver as to relevant confidential disclosures between attorney and client.

Motions for directed verdict of acquittal and for a new trial were seasonably presented and denied. Additionally, a motion to suppress evidence was heard and denied. Defendant appealed. In the course of defendant's trial, certain evidence was admitted over defendant's objection, and portions of the instructions to the jury were challenged by defendant. Defendant contended that once a technically invalid search warrant issued, a police officer purporting to act under authority of the warrant could not under any circumstances make a valid seizure of the property described therein. However, since the items sought were in plain view and the officer had reason to believe the items were stolen, the officer could seize the items as evidence. Also at issue was whether those items were being in defendant's vehicle was sufficient to support a presumption of defendant's participation in the criminal conduct. The court found that the evidence was not of the nature and quality required to raise the presumption and ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tenant challenged an order of a superior court (Maine), dismissing her appeal of a district court's judgment in favor of plaintiff landlords in a forcible entry and detainer action that the landlords filed against the tenant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's favorable judgment for the landlords, notwithstanding the tenant's meritorious affirmative defense of equitable title, was based on the tenant's non-compliance with Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 6006, which required that she, an indigent, provide bond to secure the landlords against all intervening damages and costs and to provide a reasonable rent. The appeal's dismissal was based on her failure to provide bond under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 6008. The court sustained the tenant's appeal and remanded to the superior court with an instruction to set aside the district court's judgment. By compelling the tenant to recognize or give bond as a prerequisite to a hearing of her equitable title defense when her indigency prevented her from doing so, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 6006 violated her constitutional equal protection rights and was unconstitutional and void as applied to her. For the same reason, Me. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chapter 102, &sect; 102.1 of the city's ordinance provided for initiative and referendum on certain matters of municipal concern but required that the citizens had to sign a petition in the office of the city clerk. The citizens alleged that because of illness, infirmity, or the press of business they were unable to go to the clerk's office to sign the petition. The citizens contended that the requirement that such a petition be signed only in the city clerk's office discriminated against them and denied them the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Me. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 and by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed the order, finding that the city council intended the ordinance to be a safeguard against fraud in obtaining use of the referendum process. The court found that the method chosen by the council was neither unreasonable nor oppressive and that the ordinance applied to all voters.

The constitutionality of the measure was attacked. The act was the fourth of its nature, two previous measures having been declared unconstitutional by litigation, and the provisions of a proposed third questioned as to constitutionality by an Opinion of the Justices, resulting in non-enactment. The validity of statutory security bonding provisions as applied to the milk industry in substantially identical form had been twice considered, with the same result, by a unanimous court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was charged in an indictment with escaping from the Maine State Prison Farm.

The inmate contended that he was denied equal protection of the law in that he received a sentence longer than the maximum sentence that could have been imposed upon a woman who escaped from incarceration while serving the same state prison sentence for the same offense. The inmate argued that a male prisoner escaping from the prison was punishable by imprisonment for &quot;any term of years,&quot; whereas a woman serving a prison sentence but confined pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat.

The trial court ordered the sentences to run consecutively. The inmate commenced a first post-conviction petition for writ of habeas corpus. The petition was denied. No appeal was perfected. The State alleged in its motion to dismiss the second petition that the petition raised no new grounds for relief, which had not been adjudicated in the prior proceedings and which could not have been raised in the prior proceedings. The court held that the only allegation made by the inmate that was not included in the first petition was an allegation of counsel's incompetence. The court determined that nothing in the record suggested that the inmate's counsel was deficient in his duty to protect the inmate's rights. The court ruled that Me. Rev. Stat.

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect;&sect; 4701-4709, in order to prevent the owners from filling and developing coastal wetlands on their property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners proposed to fill the land and to the offer it for sale and the court found that the refusal to permit the deposit of fill prevented development. The single justice found that the highest and best use for the land, so filled, was for housing, and that unfilled the land had no commercial value. The issue, according to the court, was whether denial of the permit and issuance of the injunction so limited the use to the owners of their land that the deprivation amounted to a taking of their property without constitutional due process and just compensation. The court ruled that as distinguished from conventional zoning for town protection, the area of wetlands preservation was of statewide concern. To leave the owners with commercially valueless land in upholding the restrictions imposed, was to charge them with more than their just share of the cost of this state-wide conservation program. The application of the Wetlands Act restriction here deprived the owners of the reasonable use of their property and was an unreasonable exercise of police power and equivalent to taking within constitutional considerations.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that all reasonable access to the abutters' property was destroyed by the town's action because without repair and maintenance, the road over time would have become impassable or unsafe for travel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The House of Representatives propounded four questions to the court, requesting the opinions of the Justices on the questions concerning the constitutionality of a pending bill, Me. H.P. 1395, 104th Legis. (1970), which was entitled &quot;An Act Creating a Nonpublic Elementary Education Assistance Act.&quot; The justices agreed in their answers to the second, third, and fourth questions, but differed in their answers to the first question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first question asked if any of the provisions of the Act as set forth in the bill violated the Establishment Clause or Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Four of the Justices were of the opinion that the bill was not constitutional, while two were of the opinion that it was. The four Justices answered in the affirmative as to sectarian schools. They found that the purpose and primary effect of the bill was to subsidize sectarian schools, which would impermissibly invade the sectarian school system. Such subsidization would assure the continuance of the schools' purposes of advancing their faiths. All the Justices answered the second question in the negative. The provisions did not violate the Free Exercise Clause, as no discrimination against the practice of religion appeared on the face of the Act. The Justices answered the third in the negative, finding that the provisions of &sect; 3804 did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power to a governmental agency. Finally, the Justices answered the fourth question in the negative, stating that the provisions did not violate Me. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, which was a mandate to insure the establishment of public schools.</SPAN></P>

Four Justices answered the first question in the affirmative, stating that the provisions of the Act as set forth in the bill were unconstitutional. Two Justices answered the first question in the negative, answering that the bill was constitutional. All the Justices answered the other three questions in the negative, finding no other constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that because no specific standards were provided in the ordinance governing the approval or disapproval of permits that the approval condition was unconstitutional and void. The board contended that the ordinance provided standards in general terms governing all actions of the board which were adequate to satisfy constitutional requirements. The court remanded the matter and ordered the permit be issued and held that the board's denial was an unlawful exercise of the authority conferred upon it by the zoning ordinance. The court found that there were no facts from which it could be inferred that the proposed station would have possessed any unique or distinctive characteristics which would have served to differentiate it from any other gas stations in the same zone. The fact that the ordinance permitted gas stations showed they were not considered to be injurious or detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare and no facts were shown that supported the board's conclusion that health, safety, or general welfare would not be promoted by the gas station. The court found that the board's decision amounted to usurpation of a purely legislative function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed a judgment from the lower court (Maine), which dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The issue was whether petitioner's sentence of not less than four nor more than eight years in prison upon his conviction for uttering a forged check was unlawful because the sentencing judge took into consideration petitioner's 1954 conviction and sentence for larceny, which he found was unconstitutionally imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Even in the face of a finding by the lower court that petitioner's 1954 conviction and sentence were illegal for deprivation of petitioner's constitutional rights, the justice's conclusion that petitioner's current sentence was free from any taint of constitutional deficiency had to be sustained. Petitioner was not given the maximum penalty which Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 1501 sanctioned. Petitioner's criminal record, considered by the sentencing judge at the time of the current sentence, was a true record, including that of his 1954 voidable sentence. As pre-sentence information, the lower court took into consideration, not only petitioner's 1954 conviction, but other convictions for forgery and larceny. His past criminal activity, aside from his 1954 conviction, was of such serious nature as to justify in the mind of the sentencing judge petitioner's current sentence of not less than four nor more than eight years. Petitioner had the burden to show that the sentence procedure was so impregnated with fundamental unfairness that his current sentence was in violation of due process. In this, petitioner had failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By petition for post conviction relief, defendant appealed from an order of the trial court (Maine), which convicted her of violating the vagrancy statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 3758. She contended that the statute, which made offenders of all idle and disorderly persons having no visible means of support, neglecting all lawful calling or employment, was unconstitutionally vague under both the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the vagrancy law imposed a penalty for non-action, for neutral passivity, or upon a person's condition, status, mode of life, or reputation. The court agreed and held that the statute was unconstitutional. Although being disorderly required an accused to have acted, and had a recognized definition, the remainder of the phrase at issue was too vague to be enforced. That language penalized idleness, having no visible means of support, and neglecting all lawful calling and employment without providing intelligible standards to guide an accused, an apprehending officer or the court. A defendant was left at the mercy of an arresting officer's whim or caprice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the matter to the superior court for the issuance of a writ discharging defendant from custody.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that the indictment was legally sufficient and that defendant was properly charged under indecent liberties statute,&nbsp;Me. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This came upon questions propounded by the Maine Senate. The first question was whether &sect; 49 of Legislative Document No. 1543 violated the provisions relating to equal protection contained in the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Me. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed section was to appear within Title 12 of the Revised Statutes Annotated under the general subject of conservation and among sections intended to discourage the taking of wild game by hunting from automobiles, from railways, the use of silencers on firearms and automatic weapons, hunting with nets, traps, cross bow or snares, and the use of pole traps. The court concluded that, because the proposed measure was a measure ostensibly to promote conservation, no proper and justifiable distinction between the possession of firearms by a resident and a non-resident worker was apparent, and the measure was arbitrary and unconstitutional. The court therefore answered question one in the affirmative. In view of the court's answer to question one, it deemed it unnecessary to answer question two.</SPAN></P>

Instead, the legislature had to initially make at least a general determination that the public exigencies required the taking. That statute creating the Commission authorized the Commission to purchase or lease lands to acquire water rights and to build dams for the purpose of conserving Atlantic sea run salmon, provided that the prior rights of towns were not affected by the Commission's act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A District Court judge ruled that certain evidence taken from defendant in his trial for possession of intoxicating liquor was inadmissible as a result of an illegal search and seizure. The State appealed and also moved that the action be reported to the instant court for determination of the questions of law involved in the judge's ruling. Defendant then filed a motion to dismiss the State's appeal. The court dismissed the appeal, explaining that while Me. Dist. Ct. R. 41 and Me. R. Crim. P. 41 adopted the same procedure for execution of search warrants, neither provided for the use of motions to suppress in pending misdemeanor cases in District Court. Moreover, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 2115-A, which created a right of appeal by the State on questions of law from an order suppressing evidence, did not create a procedural device of a motion to suppress addressed to a District Court. As the District judge's ruling on admissibility was merely advisory, the State's appeal was a nullity. Finally, because there was no provision for the reporting of cases from the District Court to the Law Court, the court refused to rule whether the judge's reporting of the matter was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

In sustaining the appeal, the court held that to bring Maine's criminal procedure respecting trials for assault and battery within the constitutional guidelines set by the United States Supreme Court concerning the applicability of the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial in serious criminal cases, the holdings in the case of State of Maine v. Ferris, 249 A.2d 523 (1969) were not retroactive and did not affect those persons whose trials had commenced prior to May 20, 1968, the date of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968).

Ann. tit. 12, &sect;&sect; 4701-4709, regulating the alteration of wetlands, was unconstitutional with respect to the takings issue. The owners argued that the outright denial of the right to fill deprived them of the only practical use to which the property could be put and still give them a fair return on their investment. The Board contended that in restricting the owners' use of their property the State, through the Board, was acting in the reasonable exercise of its police power. The court found no facts to support either position, as the statement of facts was silent as to the nature of the land, the benefits or harm to be expected if the land was filled or not filled, or even whether the statute was applicable to the owners' property. The court said it would not consider only the general validity of the Act rather than its application to the issues presented. Further factfinding was required.</SPAN></P>

His search was conducted under the immediate supervision of the detective who had the warrant and was on another floor of the building. Defendant had no grievance of any kind, let alone a constitutional one. Posting the warrant and inventory and issuing a receipt for property taken were ministerial acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged that defendant embezzled and fraudulently converted property, and did not state that defendant embezzled or fraudulently converted the property to her own use. The indictment therefore did not contain all statutory language. The court held that the indictment charged sufficient facts to constitute the offense of larceny by embezzlement even though it did not charge that defendant converted the property to her own use. The words &quot;to his own use&quot; in the statute were mere surplusage. The crime was based on the deprivation of an owner of property and could not be lessened by the fact that the conversion was not for the direct benefit of the taker. The indictment adequately informed defendant of the charge against her and defendant suffered no risk of being placed in jeopardy of the same offense in the future. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 2108 was constitutional even though it allowed the State to prove that the crime was committed within six months before the time stated in the indictment and to prove that the money embezzled was of &quot;whatever amount.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By reason of an order issued by the city electrician, the supplier disconnected electrical service to the hotel for a period of approximately 10 days. The electrician had determined that the conditions at the hotel were in violation of the National Electrical Code and city requirements. The hotel alleged that defendants, including the electrician, severally, without legal cause or justification, terminated the electrical service to the hotel. The supplier and the city moved under Me. R. Civ. P. 56 for summary judgment, which was granted. The hotel challenged the validity of the ordinance authorizing the electrician to order the disconnection of service to the hotel. The court found that issue irrelevant in testing the duty of the city and the supplier. As to the city, the court held that the city was not liable, even if the electrician had acted wrongfully, because it did not direct the electrician to act as he did. As to the supplier, the court held that it was not guilty of negligence for discontinuing the energy supply to the hotel because the electrician, a public official, had notified the supplier that the hotel's wiring was defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with manslaughter, but was convicted of assault. Defendant challenged the conviction first contending that the verdict was not supported by the evidence. The court disagreed holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction on assault. Defendant argued, however, that because the indictment charged manslaughter, the trial court erred in instructing the jury on assault. Again, the court disagreed holding that even if such was an error on the part of the trial court it was not of a prejudicial nature and was not calculated to result in injustice. Finally, defendant argued that the statute under which he was convicted, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 201 was unconstitutional in that it was vague and overbroad. The court noted that while the determination of guilt or innocence was not taken from the jury's consideration, the length of the sentence was, by the terms of the statute, thus defendant could have been given the status of a felon without the privilege of the jury trial. Accordingly, that portion of the statute that imposed the penalty was declared unconstitutional. As a result, the appeal was sustained.</SPAN></P>

Defendants agreed that the applicant did not qualify to take the examination unless the resolve was valid and constitutional. The court held that the resolve was special legislation and was barred by Me. Const. art. IV, Part Third, &sect; 13. General legislation controlling the profession of pharmacy with the examination and licensing of pharmacists was practicable. Moreover, the exemption of the applicant violated the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by both the United States and Maine Constitutions. It could never be within the bounds of legitimate legislation to enact a special law or pass a resolve dispensing with the general law and granting a privilege and indulgence to one man, by way of exemption from the operation and effect of the general law, leaving all other persons under its operation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review from an order of a lower court (Maine) denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The prisoner contended that his earlier prosecution and conviction as a habitual criminal violated the fairness doctrine and his right to due process of law because the indictment contained both a theft offense and a prior conviction that prejudicially influenced the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1968, the prisoner sought a writ of habeas corpus contending that his conviction in 1957 as a habitual criminal and his sentence of 15 to 30 years' incarceration violated due process. In particular, he argued that by including a 1953 felony conviction in the indictment charging him with grand larceny, the jury's knowledge of the prior conviction was prejudicial and denied him a fair trial. The prisoner also claimed that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect; 1315 was violated and that his sentence was illegal. The writ was denied. On review, the court noted that in 1961 any prosecution under the recidivist statute required two separate inducements and trials. However, the practice of one indictment was never found to be unconstitutional, even by the U.S. Supreme Court. From the record, it appeared the prisoner admitted the 1953 conviction only after he had taken the stand to dispute its felony status and had been validly impeached as a witness with an earlier 1948 conviction pursuant to Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 56. His sentence was well within the range permitted by statute.</SPAN></P>

The court considered the challenge on report, on the lot owner's complaint, the Board's answer, and an agreed statement of facts. The owner disputed the Board's right to deny a permit when the intended use fell within those allowed in a Commercial Z zone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning ordinance at issue provided that all major changes of uses of land, buildings, or structures in a Commercial C zone where subject to the Board's approval. The Board denied the application on the grounds that it would create a traffic hazard. The court initially found that the only powers expressly given to the Board under the applicable ordinance were to determine whether the use applied for was permitted in the zone at issue, to ascertain that the planned use complied with the development requirements, and to prescribe conditions of use which it found would not be detrimental to the neighborhood. The court then considered whether the city could endow the Board with discretionary authority to approve or disapprove applications for permits for the types of uses permitted in a zone when the development requirements had been met. The court held that because the city had provided the Board with no standards or guides to use in exercising its discretion, the ordinance denied equal protection to the citizens and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the city's zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and void insofar as it attempted to delegate to the Board of Zoning Appeals authority to approve or reject applications without adequate standards for the Board's guidance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to robbery under a federal statute; had served his federal sentence; and had since been found guilty on trial for robbery under state law. The state and the federal prosecutions arose from identical facts. On appeal, the court found that there was no requirement of double jeopardy, of due process, or of fundamental fairness, which mandated that the prosecution by one sovereign of given criminal acts satisfied, as a matter of law, the legitimate needs of the second sovereign. Defendant also failed to substantiate claims that he was denied a speedy trial and that he was not taken before a magistrate within a reasonable time. From the issuance of the state warrant of arrest until the indictments were returned, defendant was in federal custody; he could not say that he was harmed by the State in not acting under the warrant during his detention for the federal crime. The compelled disclosure by defendant of information at his sentencing before the federal judge was incriminating information that he was not compelled to disclose in contested state proceedings under constitutional principles; it was prejudicial error for the trial court to admit the information.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was later indicted in the federal court, and an element of the crime charged was that he was a person previously convicted in Maine of a crime punishable by a prison term in excess of one year. In order to set aside the Maine conviction, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, seeking an opportunity to prove that the pictures stolen in Maine had a value not in excess of $ 26.00 and that such fact was then unknown to him when he entered his guilty plea. The trial court denied his petition for relief, and he appealed. The court denied the appeal because the exclusive remedy for relief under Me. Rev. Stat.

Twelve years later, the provision for the payment of tolls for use of the bridge was repealed, even though the repealing act had no provision for submission to the people in referendum. Plaintiff citizen filed a petition that challenged the repealing act and sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. Defendant state highway officials filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen, as a resident registered voter and taxpayer, alleged that he was concerned about and interested in his rights and certain legal relations affected by removal of the tolls from the bridge, so he sought a ruling of invalidity of the repealing act and requested injunction against its enforcement. The court denied the motion to dismiss, denied the prayer for injunction, and dismissed the petition. The court determined that there was a controversy and adversity of interest. The citizen, however, did not allege financial &quot;damage,&quot; actual or threatened. The removal of tolls cast the financial responsibility of maintaining the bridge and retiring its bonds on the general highway fund, the source of which was not direct taxation, and the effect of which on him, the citizen conceded was minimal. The ultimate issue was whether the legislature was empowered to repeal without reference to the people an act previously passed by a reference to the people. The court concluded that there was no constitutional provision prohibiting the passage of the repealing act without the inclusion of referendum provisions. The challenged statute was within legislative competence.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile sought relief from his alleged illegal imprisonment in post-conviction habeas corpus under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5502. The court denied his petition.

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 5951 et seq., upon pleadings presented under Me. R. Civ. P. 8(g) against appellee Commissioner of Sea and Shore Fisheries. Both fisheries were denied permits for access to the Maine market for the sale of lobster meat removed from the shell for the reason that their businesses were outside the State of Maine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants had also filed proceeding in a federal district court against the Commissioner. The federal court exercised the doctrine of abstention. For the reason that the federal court, by its order, retained jurisdiction of the cause and the constitutional issue were not briefed or argued, the court accepted the case as postured. In answer to the first question, the court stated that except for Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect;&sect; 4402, 4454, 4455 and 4456, with the limitations specifically contained therein there was no law in Maine that restricted or forbade the possession, importation, processing, sale, shipment, or transportation in the state of foreign lobster meat of legal size as fixed by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 4455. In answer to the second question, refusal of the Commissioner to issue permits for the removal of lobster meat from the shell at appellants' out-of-state places of business, was permitted, but not required, under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 4402, or any other section of the Sea and Shore Fisheries Law of Maine, not only because the fixed places of business were outside the state, but that such licenses, if issued, could have no extraterritorial effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim died after defendant struck her with a car. He had been drinking and was charged with operating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Under &sect; 1315, the death of the victim had to result within one year of the reckless operation of the car. The indictment made no specific allegation that the death of the victim occurred within one year. The court wrote that careful pleading would have resulted in a precise allegation of death within one year, but the absence of such an allegation was not an error. The test in part was whether or not an accused person of reasonable, normal intelligence would by the indictment's language be informed adequately of the crime charged and the nature of it to be able to defend. The date of the death was not alleged, but the indictment was dated slightly more than one month after the recklessness that it alleged occurred on a certain date; hence, the language informed defendant that on the date of the indictment the State charged that the victim was dead. Where an indictment alleged an act that caused death and was returned within the period set by statute, it necessarily followed that death occurred within the statutory period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The college obtained a license from the Water Improvement Commission to discharge its waste water into a small, non-navigable brook that ran through the property of several residential owners.

The college argued that the landowners had abandoned their legal and administrative remedies, and thus were not entitled to an equitable remedy from the court. The court held that unlike the riparian rights in navigable waterways, the riparian rights in non-navigable bodies of water were private property rights. And pursuant to the commission's enabling statutes, Me. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature asked the court if the definitions of &quot;industrial project&quot;, as set forth in Sec. 1 of Legislative Document 33 as amended by Committee Amendment &quot;A&quot;, were constitutional and within the authority granted to it by Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 14-A. Secondly, the legislature asked if Sec. 2 of the same document violated the state constitution in providing for direct loans to applicants and dispensing with the necessity of a local development corporation. As to the first question, the court answered in the negative. The court stated that the constitution authorized legislative provisions for insured mortgage loans for the purpose of fostering, encouraging and assisting the physical location, settlement and resettlement of industrial and manufacturing enterprises within the state. The court ruled that the word &quot;industry&quot; did not equate with the phrase &quot;industrial and manufacturing enterprise&quot;, as used in the document. The court then held that the legislation could not extend credit to activities beyond the scope of the constitutional limits imposed by the phrase &quot;industrial and manufacturing enterprises&quot;.

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, &sect; 1754 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility sold an undivided one-half interest in certain installed utility poles to a telephone company. It purchased from the telephone company an undivided one-half interest in certain other installed utility poles. The utility contended that the poles were interests in real property by accession, which were not subject to the act, rather than tangible personal property subject to the act. The tax assessor determined the poles to be personal property, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court first noted that the utility was burdened with proof of both the tax exemption and the claimed accession. The court held that personal property became part of real estate by accession only when it was 1) physically annexed to the realty, 2) was adapted to the use to which the land to which it was annexed was put, or the chattel and the real estate were united in the prosecution of a common enterprise, and 3) it was so annexed with the intention on the part of the person making the annexation to make it a permanent accession to the realty. Because the annexation of the utility poles to the ground did not satisfy the second part of the test, the poles remained personal property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature amended Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 1553, to preclude beauty schools and students from charging a fee for services and from charging more than the reasonable cost of supplies and materials used. The beauty school filed a declaratory action seeking to have the amendment declared invalid and requested that a temporary restraining order be issued to enjoin the amendment's enforcement. The superior court found the statute to be invalid and issued the restraining order. The state board appealed. In reversing, the court concluded that the statute was a constitutional exercise of police power. The service to the public by these schools without price control was detrimental to student training and to their development of competence in their field because emphasis could improperly shift to profit than to the development of student skills. The public interest in its exposure to the abundance of beauty aids on the market, many of which might involve personal injury where inexpertly applied, was a matter of health, safety, and welfare and was a proper matter for exercise of the state's police power.</SPAN></P>

The parties moved to dismiss the certification on constitutional and procedural grounds. The parties carried their motion. Me. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 provided that the judicial power of the state was vested in the court. Although the Constitution did not authorize the court to issue advisory opinions, the court's investiture with &quot;judicial power&quot; conferred upon it the power to hear and determine controversies between adverse parties and questions in litigation, including the inherent authority to make binding orders or judgments. The court's participation in the certification procedure was proper because the court had, without any express grant, the inherent right to accomplish all objects naturally within the orbit of its department, not expressly limited by the fact of the existence of a similar power elsewhere or the express limitations in the constitution. The court refused to answer the questions certified because the certifying court had not yet resolved the facts founding the parties' dispute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant, whose request for a collection agency license was denied by defendant, the Maine Commissioner of Banking, appealed from a decision of the trial court (Maine), which denied his petition for injunctive relief against enforcement of the statute regulating collection agencies, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect;&sect; 571-583, and for a declaratory judgment on the validity of the legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant operated a collection agency until he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison. Upon his release, he renewed the operation of his agency. The legislature subsequently passed an act regulating collection agencies, pursuant to which the applicant was required to obtain a license. After the applicant's request for a license was denied on the basis of his prior conviction, he filed suit to challenge the validity of the statute. The court held that: (1) the statute did not exceed the state's police power because regulating collection agencies was a reasonable means to assure that collection agents were trustworthy and that collection procedures were kept within legally acceptable bounds; (2) the statute was not an ex post facto law because the ex post facto doctrine had no application to civil matters; and (3) the statute did not violate due process or equal protection because the purpose of the statute was not to punish ex-felons but to devise appropriate regulation for an activity in the public interest, and the statute permissibly conditioned the present ability to obtain a license upon past conduct that occurred prior to the passage of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute was valid and affirmed the trial court's denial of the applicant's petition for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

Finally, he claimed that the prosecutor's questions asking him whether certain prior convictions were for &quot;sodomy, or being a moral degenerate,&quot; were prejudicial. On appeal, the court sustained the appeal, holding that it was prejudicial for the prosecutor to ask defendant whether the prior convictions were for sodomy or being a moral degenerate. The prosecutor did not know whether defendant had previously been convicted of such crimes. Under Me. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered that the method of apportioning senators, set forth in Legislative Document 1630 was constitutional. In the court's opinion the permitted deviation of 10 percent from the median number of inhabitants for each senatorial district was within constitutional standards. Constitutional requirements would be met if the Legislature made a fair and honest effort to establish districts in such manner that it could reasonably be anticipated that a majority of the senators were so elected as to represent at least 50 percent of the population. If in practical operation a majority was so elected as to be representative of a lesser percentage of the population, no violation of constitutional requirements would occur if such controlling percentage was only slightly below 50 percent, but any substantial deviation below 50 percent could exceed tolerable and permissible limits. Review and reapportionment every tenth year as proposed would meet constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

XIV and Me. Const. art. I, &sect; 6-A. The court held that the Insurance Commissioner had control over the issuance of contracts by plaintiff within the limits expressed in Maine laws.

The court determined that the protection and promotion of the sardine industry was of public concern and that the Legislature could determine within reasonable bounds what was necessary for the protection and promotion of the industry. The court ruled that the act imposed an excise tax upon the privilege of packing sardines rather than a property tax upon the sardines themselves, so Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8 did not apply to the act. The court held that the Maine Constitution did not limit the legislative imposition of excise taxes or require them to be applied in an equal and uniform manner.

The court held the trial court committed prejudicial error when its jury instruction as to mental disease or defect constituted a reversion to the restrictive and superseded M'Naghten Rule. The court noted that the instruction was a reversion to the M'Naghten Rule because defendant was required to prove preponderantly that he could not at the time of the imputed crime distinguish between right and wrong and that his alleged malefaction was the product of such disease or defect. The court concluded: (1) that the charge deprived him of the jury consideration of the medical testimony as to the issue of his mental inability to refrain from the imputed homicide irrespective of his knowledge of right and wrong at the time of the incident; (2) that the jury was not informed that it was required to decide whether, at the time of the incident, his mental or emotional processes were substantially affected and whether his behavior controls were substantially impaired; and (3) that, although the defense had not objected to the charge at the trial court level, the appeal had to be sustained because the error was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Counsel for petitioner in oral argument conceded that this ground lacked merit. No matter of jurisdiction or constitutional right was involved. As his second ground for relief, petitioner claimed that the indictment on which he was convicted did not inform him of the nature and cause of the accusation. The justice below determined that this issue had been adjudicated against the petitioner in a prior proceeding. No appeal from the prior ruling was included in the points of appeal, and the parties agreed that the issue was, therefore, not properly before the court. The court held that Me. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission brought a complaint against the milk supplier, and sought to enjoin it against certain action. The justice denied the injunction and dismissed the complaint. The commission appealed. It was the contention of the milk supplier that the retrospective unconstitutionality of the consumer price that had been fixed was the sole factor allowing the return of the money. In such an event, the milk supplier argued, the price fixed was a nullity and void, and the issuing of the coupons could not be deemed in legal effect a destruction of the price schedule as a gratuity, rebate or discount. In sustaining the appeal, the court held that Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 4 (1954), prohibited any person from engaging in any practice destructive of the scheduled minimum prices for milk, including but not limited to any discount, rebate, or gratuity. The milk supplier, in issuing the coupons was engaged in a practice destructive of the scheduled minimum prices of milk by offering an inducement to purchase. The milk supplier should have been permanently enjoined from doing the acts set forth in the prayer of the commission for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by holders of bond issued by School Administrative District No. 3 against District and others for judgment declaring statute providing for reorganization of District by removal from District of three towns unconstitutional. On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court, Williamson, C. J., held that act impaired obligation of bonds and was unconstitutional in that it destroyed power of district to tax within withdrawn towns and virtually destroyed right of bondholder to levy on property within those towns and inasmuch as intent of legislature could not be carried out if offending section were severed from act, entire act was a nullity.

The lower court ruled in the bondholders' favor and held that the destruction of the power of the district to tax, or of the right of the bondholders to levy, in any one town of the district was an impairment of the obligation of the bond in violation of the contract clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions. The court concluded that the substitute benefit to the bondholders under the 1963 Act fell far short of a remedy substantially equivalent to the remedies available on the issuance of the bonds. The court held that without suitable provisions for adjustment of liability on the bonds, the plan of reorganization of the district was incomplete and the 1963 Act was to be considered a nullity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town enacted a zoning ordinance which prohibited the parking of a mobile home or trailer in a residential and farming zoned area. The owner applied for a variance which would permit him to park his mobile home in a residential area. The application was denied, and the board upheld the denial. The owner sought review, and the court dismissed his appeal. In order to constitute a valid exercise of the police power the restriction imposed by a zoning ordinance had to bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public. Every zoning ordinance was presumed constitutional and would not be declared unconstitutional without clear and irrefutable evidence that it infringed the paramount law. Here, the restriction was permissible because the parking of mobile homes in such areas was inconsistent with community development. Further, the restriction was permissible because mobile homes were not banned entirely from the municipality.</SPAN></P>

The store was not a drug store because it did not have a license to sell prescription medicine. Merely because drug stores, restaurants, or bookstores and the stores sold the same items did not mean that the stores were exempt as a drug store, restaurant, or bookstore. Also, the sale of souvenirs did not include the sale of non-souvenir items. The Law was not vague because its exemptions clearly did not apply to the stores. The Law did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the classification against the stores was within the state's police powers. The possibility of competition from stores exempted by local option, because they were ships, or because they provided automated service did not make the Law unconstitutional under the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses.</SPAN></P>

Based on its review of the disputed ordinance's provisions, the court determined that the generating statute and the bric-a-brac classification were nondescript, indefinite, and constituted a violation of due process because the ordinance described a category conducive to arbitrary abuse precluding its fair utilization and enforcement.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 100, &sect; 51 was constitutional and affirmed the determination of appellee licensing board, which revoked the victualer's license pursuant to &sect; 51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee contended that &sect; 51 was an improper delegation of legislative power because it granted to the board arbitrary discretion when it provided that a license could be revoked if the licensee were determined to be unfit to hold a license. The trial court found that the licensee had permitted gambling upon the premises, and it upheld the revocation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The legislature, by specifying certain requirements for victualers, had sufficiently defined the prohibitions applicable to licensees. The court noted that a victualer's license was a privilege, so that the legislature could properly provide a procedure for license revocation. The legislature had not improperly delegated its power to make law but had only delegated the power to determine the facts upon which the law made its own action depend. The court noted that there were ample safeguards preventing the arbitrary exercise of power, such as substantial procedural features and the availability of judicial review. Finally, while the licensee's notice of the hearing was inadequate, he had cured the inadequacy of the notice by appearing at the hearing and participating therein.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the exceptions to the trial court's judgment, which determined that the victualer's license had properly been revoked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State imposed a quahog tax against the shellfish dealer. The shellfish dealer argued that the quahog tax was unconstitutional because the statute originated in the Senate and not in the House of Representatives in violation of Me. Const. Art.

The parties agreed that if the quahog tax was constitutional and a valid exercise of the State's taxing power, the State was entitled to the sum requested. The court determined that the purpose of the quahog tax was to raise funds for the benefit of the quahog industry and thus the State. Because the statute was not a bill to raise revenue within the meaning of the Constitution, the court did not need to consider in what branch of the legislature the bill was introduced. The court found that the tax was levied for a public purpose and therefore, survived the shellfish dealer's attack.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 44, &sect;&sect; 67 and 69 (1954). The company challenged, inter alia, the exclusion of an amount from the rate base valuation that was paid by the company for a predecessor's properties and constituted an over capitalization in excess of the original cost of the same. The court held that the commission's suspension of the amount was unlawful. The court determined that under 1953 Me. Laws 377, &sect; 2, the commission was instructed to consider evidence of the cost of the property when first devoted to public use, prudent acquisition cost to the public utility, and any other relevant factors. The court found that 45 years prior to the hearing before the commission, the write-up was introduced upon the predecessor's records with the company having no part in the incident. The court held that a formalistic judgment upon the segregated write-up was not a fair compliance with &sect; 2 because the company paid the enlarged cost and there was no evidence negating an arm's length dealing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the company's petition in equity alleging confiscation, allowed the company's exceptions to the commission's refusal to allow to the company's request for a rate increase, and reversed and remanded the commission's suspension in the rate base of an adjusted acquisition cost of a predecessor's properties acquired by the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a group of taxpayers and residents, filed for declaratory judgment with the law court (Maine) against numerous school district and State defendants, to test the constitutionality of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 41, &sect;&sect; 111-A through 111-U (the Sinclair Act), under which their school administrative district was organized. They argued that the legislature had exceeded its constitutional powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the Sinclair Act (Act) was unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions and an injunction against the exercise by defendants of any rights, duties, or powers under the Act. The petition was denied. The legislature had provided machinery to form school administrative districts comprising two or more municipalities on vote of the municipalities and subject to approval of the state School District Commission, an administrative agency operating under principles and standards set forth in the Act. Plaintiffs argued that the Act violated the state constitution as towns escaped an obligation to support and maintain public schools and were deprived of responsibility for the operation and control of their public schools. They argued that there was also an unlawful delegation to the School District Commission to approve the organization of such districts and grant a certificate of organization in violation of the separation of powers and delegation of legislative power. The court disagreed, finding the Act was constitutional and the legislature had not exceeded its powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for entry of judgment. There was no constitutional violation by the legislature and no improper delegation of legislative power. Plaintiffs were not entitled to the relief sought. They raised no constitutional issues upon the sufficiency of the criteria or standards for establishing school administrative districts. They had no property interests at stake in creation of the district so had suffered no property deprivation.</SPAN></P>

The case came before the court on report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, by means of an inter vivos indenture of trust, conveyed to a co-trustee and herself certain assets for the ultimate benefit of a number of persons named therein. She also executed a last will and testament. Because the decedent had retained a life estate in the property conveyed in trust, as well as power of revocation, and for other reasons based upon the Internal Revenue Code, all of the assets formerly owned by the decedent, which passed to the parties to the litigation, were deemed includible in her estate for the assessment of the Federal Estate Tax. The trustee argued that liability for equitable contribution existed both under the provisions of the trust as well as under principles of equity and good conscience. The court held that the Federal Estate Tax was the joint and several obligation of all of the inter vivos transferees, and that each was liable to the trustee for his proportionate share of the tax unless exonerated by a different intent expressed by the decedent. The court was convinced, based on the language of the trust indenture, that she limited the payment of taxes by the trustee to assets which passed under the trust and to no other assets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a decree in favor of the trustee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, thirteen taxable inhabitants of the city, sought review of the decision of the trial court (Maine), which dismissed appellants' bill in equity seeking an injunction against appellees, mayor, treasurer, and inhabitants of the city, to prohibit the carrying out of an ordinance and appropriation for the transportation of school children to and from non-public schools and to have the ordinance declared illegal and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance providing transportation for children to and from public and non-public schools to conserve the health, safety, and welfare of the children. A bill in equity was brought by appellants seeking to enjoin appellees from carrying into effect the provisions of the ordinance and to have the ordinance and appropriation order decreed as illegal, invalid, void and of no effect. After a hearing on the bill, answer, and replication, the justice below dismissed the bill. On appeal, the court sustained the appeal and remanded the matter for entry of a decree in accordance with its opinion. The court held that the state had never by enabling legislation or by the terms of the city charter or by express grant or implication, empowered or authorized appellees to enact such an ordinance and order and the expenditure of public funds for transportation to non-public schools would have been unlawful. The court held that the city's police power could not be used to accomplish an act not authorized by the city charter. The state maintained control of education and when the use of public funds has been permitted, the authorization was specific and well defined.</SPAN></P>

The provisions of sections two, four, and five of the bill amounted to a suspension of the sovereign power to tax in violation of section 9 of Article IX of the Constitution of Maine.

Laws 32, as applied to the business activities of petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners activities involved selling magazine advertising and publishing magazines that contained advertising for business and income producing properties for sale, lease, or exchange. The court reasoned that the activities obviously fell within the meaning of the language &quot;to promote the sale of real estate through the listing of such property in a publication, issued primarily for such purpose or for referral of information concerning properties to licensed real estate brokers, or both.&quot; Therefore, the court concluded that if the law was constitutional, petitioners were not merely engaged in the sale and publication of magazine advertising but by operation of the law had been suddenly transformed into real estate brokers and salesmen. The court held that it would not have occurred to anyone that the purveyor of advertising space was in reality a real estate broker or salesman until by arbitrary legislative definition he was made so. The court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to petitioners, holding that the legislature could not regulate the lawful business of advertising by arbitrarily and unreasonably defining that business as something it was not.</SPAN></P>

By special demurrer the manufacturer raised several legal issues, including the question of whether the Act applied to manufacturers and producers. The lower court overruled the demurrer and the court sustained the manufacturer's exception. The court first noted that the Act, being in derogation of common law, was to be strictly construed. The court then held that the Act did not apply to manufacturers. The court construed the statute's language and noted several examples of evidence that it was intended to relate only to distributive trades. For example, the Act used a cost definition that was manifestly applicable only to distributors, an indicator that it was not designed to apply to manufacturers. It was unnecessary to consider the other reasons why the declaration was vulnerable to demurrer because the court held that the action against the producer and manufacturer had no foundation either at common law or by statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, banks that filed a suit against the turnpike authority, the utilities, and the attorney general, petitioned for a declaratory judgment to resolve the controversy regarding who was responsible for the expense of relocation and the cost of replacement following a highway project. The issue raise was whether there had been a provision for paying for the relocation expenses of the utilities. The court remanded, finding that the amendment to the enabling act of the turnpike authority, P. &amp; S. 1955, ch. 201, in so far as it purported retroactively or prospectively to affect the bonds issued pursuant to the indenture for the cost of the extension, by providing payment from the funds of the turnpike for utility relocation in the extension, was a nullity. Further, the court held that as to the trustees, bondholders, and turnpike funds, P. &amp; S. 1955, ch. 201 was unconstitutional because it violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court concluded that the utilities when it submitted to the police power had no right to reimbursement for relocation and the turnpike authority had no right to reimburse the utilities without legislative sanction.</SPAN></P>

The court answered the question and held that the legislation would be unconstitutional if enacted. The court concluded that the purpose of the act was a private purpose and not a public purpose. The court noted that the city could neither raise money by taxation nor acquire property by eminent domain for a private purpose. The court held that it did not matter that the public funds expended in acquisition of property could be repaid in whole or in part, or even with a profit.

Prospective customers visited the corporation's Boston office to lease machines or telephoned their orders to the Boston office. When a customer and the corporation agreed upon terms of the lease, the machine was either delivered in Boston to the customer or was shipped f.o.b. Boston to him in Maine. The state tax assessor argued that the corporation should pay a use tax on machines newly purchased by the corporation, which were brought into the State of Maine by the lessee for their first use. The court held that the corporation was not liable for a use tax under the statute. The use and possession of the property in Maine in its entirety was, and at all times had been, in the lessee or customer by virtue of the lease. The corporation had done nothing with respect to the machine within the State of Maine either before or since making the lease. Thus, the corporation had not exercised in Maine any right or power over the property within the statutory definition of &quot;use.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The clearance of the blighted area to remove social evils used the property for purposes of public health, morals, safety, and welfare.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff State's action against defendant corporation to recover a tax alleged to be due under the provisions of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect;&sect; 206-217 (1944) for potatoes sold and shipped, the corporation appealed a judgment of the Superior Court (Maine) in the State's favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation contended on appeal that the tax imposed an unwarranted burden on interstate commerce; that it was discriminatory, being a specific tax and not being apportioned and assessed equally with other property in the state according to its just value as required by Me. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8; and that the tax was not levied for a public purpose. The court found that the potato tax was not a tax assessed on an ad valorem basis on the value of potatoes owned, but on the amount of business done in the particular commodity within the state. Therefore, it was found to an excise tax and not a property tax. The court held that the primary purpose of the enactment of the act imposing the potato tax was the promotion of the welfare of the people of the state as a whole; that it was enacted for a public purpose and that the fact that those engaged in raising potatoes may have been incidentally benefited thereby did not change the purpose of the act from a public one to a private one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the corporation's exceptions and affirmed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The act created the sewerage district, which was a quasi-municipal corporation, and provided that the district would take over and improve the public sewers. The Public Utilities Commission approved a fee schedule. The residents filed a bill in equity against the city and the sewerage district and sought to have Chapter 211 declared unconstitutional. The court dismissed the bill, and held that the identity of inhabitancy and territory existing between the sewerage district and the city did not affect the act's constitutionality. The court concluded that the purpose of the act did not prevent the creating of the sewerage district. The court found that the evidence did not indicate that the creation of the sewerage district was a scheme to circumvent the city's constitutional five percent debt limit. The court held that the city had no power to make a contract to deprive the state of its police power. The court found that those who connected with the public sewer entered with the realization that the legislature could change the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, attorney general, and representatives and officials of a labor federation, brought mandamus proceedings in the court to compel the Secretary of State of Maine to include a proposed bill that conflicted with an initiated measure on the ballot so the electorate could decide whether to choose one or reject them both.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electors initiated a certain measure to protect the right to work and to prohibit secondary boycotts, sympathetic strikes, and jurisdictional strikes related to labor relations. A senate committee recommended that the proposed law be submitted to the voters. While the bill was waiting for submission to the voters at a future election, another bill that dealt with the same subject matter was enacted. The attorney general brought a mandamus proceeding on behalf of all the petitioners to compel the secretary to place the first bill on the ballot to allow the people to choose. A peremptory writ was ordered and exceptions were taken. The court overruled the exceptions, holding that the first bill covered the same subject matter but the two were inconsistent in essential respects. The bill had to be regarded as a substitute for the initiated measure and had to be submitted to the people as a competing measure in accordance with Me. Const. art. XXXI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the secretary's exemptions filed against the order for a writ of mandamus to be issued to ensure a bill supported by petitioners would be placed on the ballot to allow the electorate to vote on it.</SPAN></P>
