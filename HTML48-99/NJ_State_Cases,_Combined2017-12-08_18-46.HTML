</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant builder applied for a special use permit to construct a community for senior citizens. Respondent township-resident brought an action that challenged the zoning ordinance that allowed special use exceptions for such communities. The lower court granted summary judgment to respondent. The court reversed and remanded the decision. The court held that the ordinance promoted the general welfare of both the township and the region at large and complied with the enabling statute under N.J. Stat. Ann. 40:55-30 et seq. The court found that the ordinance was intended to provide housing for a specific category of people and not intended to preclude other classes of people from residing within the municipality. The court held that the age and occupancy requirements were reasonable and bore a real and substantial relationship to regulation of land use. The court found that such age restrictions were both rationally related to the concept of planned housing for the elderly and essential to the success of such developments. The court found that the amendatory ordinance was a proper exercise of the zoning power that did not violate substantive due process or equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner challenged an order of the Superior Court (New Jersey), that reversed the determination of the trial court that a zoning ordinance could create a district identifying a mobile home park exclusively for the elderly as a permissible use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner applied for a mobile home park license for his land that was zoned for that use, provided that the occupancy was limited to seniors. Before action was taken on the application, appellee taxpayers' association filed a complaint challenging Weymouth Township, N.J., Ordinances Nos. 172 (July 7, 1971), 171 (June 25, 1971), which prohibited mobile home parks, except for those occupied by the elderly. The trial court ruled for appellants, dismissing the complaint. The appellate court reversed, finding that the age limit in No. 172 exceeded municipal powers as delegated by the Zoning Enabling Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. 40:55-30 et seq., and that it was an unreasonable exercise of police power and violated equal protection under U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. On appeal, the court reversed. The municipality was acting within its authority to exclusively zone for such developments, and no constitutional violation was present, as there was a reasonable and rational relationship between the zoning ordinances and the legitimate and substantial state interest in decent and affordable housing for seniors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, holding that the zoning enabling act did authorize the development of planned housing for the elderly and the Weymouth, New Jersey township could exercise the authority to regulate such a development without violating the due process or equal protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution. There was insufficient evidence to show the existence of spot zoning, conspiracy, or a pattern of other illegal exclusionary practices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality and its officials challenged a judgment from the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which reversed a judgment upholding the validity of a zoning ordinance that prohibited mobile homes or trailers except as homes for the elderly. Appellants argued that the Appellate Division erred in sustaining the claims of appellee property owners and a taxpayers' group that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality and its officials challenged a judgment that reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of appellants in an action by appellee property owners and taxpayers' association that challenged a zoning ordinance as unconstitutional. Appellees alleged that the ordinance, which prohibited mobile homes or trailers except as homes for the elderly, constituted illegal &quot;spot zoning.&quot; The trial court ruled for appellants on all counts and dismissed the action with prejudice. The appellate division of the trial court reversed on the grounds that the ordinance was an unreasonable exercise of the police power and violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court disagreed and reinstated the trial court's judgment, holding that the equal protection clause did not require the government to treat all persons identically. The court held that the concept of the &quot;general welfare&quot; in land use regulation encompassed the provision of housing for all categories of people, including the elderly. The court noted that similar age restrictions on housing occupancy have been upheld in various contexts in other jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a judgment invalidating a zoning ordinance that prohibited mobile homes or trailers except as homes for the elderly, the judgment was vacated and the validity of the ordinance upheld because it clearly promoted the general welfare. The court held that use by appellant municipality and its officials of the zoning power to benefit the elderly did not violate constitutional principles of due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants were charged with possession of marijuana and related offenses. They were denied admission to the Bergen County, New Jersey pretrial intervention program (PTI) by program officials because the admissions criteria barred persons charged with certain offenses including possession of controlled substances. The defendants' motions to order the program director to admit them were denied, as were their motions for leave to appeal to the appellate division. A third defendant charged with a heroin related offense was denied admission to the Hudson County PTI program due to the prosecutor's refusal to consent to admission. Defendant's motion to compel the prosecutor to provide a written explanation of his refusal to consent was granted, and the prosecutor's motion for leave to appeal to the appellate division was denied. The appeal of defendants and the prosecutor in the other action were joined. The court reversed, remanding the denials of admission to the Bergen County PTI program because the criteria focused only on the charge, ignoring the potential for rehabilitation. The order to compel was affirmed, as it served the program's purpose and created a record for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and affirmed in part, because the Bergen County admission criteria for its pretrial intervention program (PTI) improperly emphasized the offense and ignored potential for rehabilitation, and it was remanded for reconsideration of the admission issue under the modified county standard. The court affirmed the order to compel the prosecutor's explanation of his refusal to consent to a third defendant's admission to PTI.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, non-profit organizations and individual taxpayers, challenged the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1B-24 on equal protection and due process grounds. The statute set forth the qualifications and recommendation procedures for appointment to the Fish and Game Council, an 11 member body appointed by the governor. Appellees alleged that the statute was constitutionally defective because it enumerated three classes of appointees to the council - sportsmen, farmers, and commercial fishermen - and excluded any person who was not recommended to the governor by either the state agricultural convention or the state federation of sportsmen's clubs. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional and enjoined appellants, state government and officials, from acting pursuant to the membership statute. On appeal, the court reversed and dissolved the injunction. The court held that the appointment process was constitutional because there was a reasonable basis for the statutory inclusion of sportsmen, farmers, and commercial fishermen; the purpose of the council was to maintain a plentiful supply of game and fish for recreational hunting and fishing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendant and state sought review of a judgment by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, which found defendant guilty of conspiracy to steal currency, armed robbery, assaults with an offensive weapon, kidnapping, kidnapping while armed, assault on a police officer, and obstruction of justice. Appellate division affirmed all convictions except assault with an offensive weapon, kidnapping, assault on a police officer and obstruction of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an attorney, was accused of selecting a house for others to rob. During the burglary and while attempting to evade police, perpetrators abducted members of the family and injured two policemen. Subsequently defendant was lured by the police into providing money for a fictitious effort to release one of the arrestees on bail so that he might flee. Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to steal currency, armed robbery, assaults with an offensive weapon, kidnapping, and assaults upon a police officer, and obstruction of justice. The appellate division reversed the convictions of assault with an offensive weapon, kidnapping, assault upon a police officer, and obstruction of justice. On review, the court held that entrapment defense had been established and that the prosecutor interfered with defendant's access to legal advice. It did not matter that defendant was an attorney. His statement was not admissible. He still had certain constitutional rights to consult with counsel. Judgment was reversed in part and affirmed in part. Remanded for a new trial on conspiracy to steal currency, armed robbery, and assault with an offensive weapon. Other counts were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

In a previous decision, the court found the Public School Education Act of 1975, N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a previous decision, the court sustained the facial validity of the Public School Education Act of 1975, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:7A-1 et seq. The court's determination was reached on the assumption that complete funding would be forthcoming to put the Act into operation. Absent the funding, the court held that the statute could never be considered in compliance with the state constitution adjuring the legislative establishment of a system of thorough and efficient education. The court retained jurisdiction. When funding was not forthcoming, the court issued an order to show cause why injunctive relief should not be mandated. Appellant state officials, appellee interested parties, and amici submitted briefs in response. The court held that the continuation of the unconstitutional system of financing into another school year could not be tolerated. The court issued an order enjoining state and local officials from expending any funds, with specified exceptions, for the support of public schools in New Jersey. The court ordered further that the injunction would not become effective if timely legislative action was taken providing for the funding of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that after July 1, 1976, every public officer, state, county, or municipal, was enjoined from expending any funds for the support of any free public school in New Jersey with the exception of funds not subject to the order as set forth therein. The court held that because an education enactment it had previously declared facially valid had not been fully funded in accordance with its previous decision, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, father of an incompetent, initiated an action to be appointed guardian of person and property of his daughter who was in a coma, and respondent guardian at litem was appointed to protect the interests of the incompetent. Appellant expressed intentions to discontinue life support, if appointed. The trial court denied the request. On review, the court held that appellant's religious freedoms weighing against the state's interest in the preservation of life did not present a constitutional question. Appellant's daughter was not unconstitutionally subjected to cruel and unusual punishment because punishment was intended to cover criminal penalty. Appellant's daughter's right of privacy could be asserted on her behalf by her guardian under present circumstances. The court affirmed the refusal to authorize withdrawal of the respirator, but appointed a new guardian of the person of his daughter with power to make decisions with regard to the identity of her physicians. The court did not prohibit the physicians from concluding that life-support should be withdrawn, but took such decision out of the trial court's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, adult males, were engaged by mutual consent in an act of fellatio in a parked vehicle when discovered by a state trooper. Defendants were convicted of committing an act of private lewdness in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-1. The lower appellate court reversed defendants' conviction because defendants committed an act of private and not public lewdness as required by &sect; 2A:115-1. The court affirmed and found that the proposed penal code sections, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-5 (1971) and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:34-1 (1971), taken together clearly evince the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission's conclusion that a private consensual act between adults such as committed by defendants should not be within the ambit of criminal statutes. The court found it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue raised by defendants, namely, whether the constitutionally protected right of privacy encompassed all private sexual activity between consenting adults so as to render N.J.

The court held that plaintiffs adopted regulations within their province and that such regulation was reasonably adapted to the end sought.

The claimant in a similar case that was argued at the same time sought and received certification from the state supreme court, which ruled in favor of the claimant. Appellant's subsequent motion for rehearing was denied by the appellate court because it was untimely. The state supreme court affirmed. After conferring with his attorney, appellant made a deliberate choice to forego review of the appellate court's adverse judgment and did not seek certification. Furthermore, there was no basis to grant relief from judgment under N.J. R. Civ. P. 4:50-1(f). The circumstances in this case did not afford any rational basis upon which to rest a decision to grant the extraordinary relief sought. Appellant was not a party to the other claimant's case. The only connection was the wholly fortuitous one that the appeals were argued together in the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court entered a judgment of acquittal n.o.v., the superior court reversed, finding that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant and that the appeal under N.J.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the state's right to appeal the judgment of acquittal n.o.v., pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 2:3-1(b)(3), did not violate the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V or N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1947), because such an appeal would not subject defendant to a second prosecution, but would merely reinstate the jury's verdict. The court noted that it adopted R. 3:18-2, permitting a defendant to make or renew a motion for judgment of acquittal after the jury had returned a verdict of guilty or was discharged without having arrived at a verdict, at the same time that it adopted R. 2:3-1(b)(3), giving the state the right to appeal a judgment of acquittal.

Defendant contended that &sect; 2A:163-3's involuntary commitment procedure was unconstitutional in that it violated the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reversed the appellate court's order, holding that the distinction between the standard for involuntary commitment for persons acquitted by reason of insanity and other persons lacked a rational basis, and thus &sect; 2A:163-3, as construed by the court in State v. Maik, 60 N.J. 203 (1971), was unconstitutional because it allowed involuntary commitment without proof of dangerousness. To that extent, the court overruled the Maik decision, and because the trial court made no inquiry into whether defendant was in fact dangerous to himself or others, he was entitled to a hearing to determine if he was mentally ill and if so, whether he was dangerous. The court ruled that its holding should be applied retroactively to other committed persons.</SPAN></P>

After condemnation, much of the neighborhood was vacant and deteriorating, making plaintiff's building unrentable.

Appellants filed suit in federal court, claiming that their constitutional rights were being violated by these disciplinary proceedings. The federal court declined to rule on their claims, deferring to the state courts because many state issues had yet to be resolved. Appellants proceeded directly to the instant appeal. The court dismissed appellants' claims, finding that the procedures taken by appellees to have met all due process requirements. The court further limited its statutory review to determining whether the language exceeded the constitutional power of the legislature, and held that appellees were entitled to a limited &quot;use&quot; immunity if they testified at these hearings, to the extent that the testimony would not later be used in a criminal trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the court failed to sufficiently charge the jury as to the requisite state of mind of the defendant, which left open the inference that the defendant could not have innocently received the money under any circumstances. The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and held that the failure of the lower court to charge the jury, whether in terms of the definition of receiving by color of office or of the intent of the other language of &sect; 2A:105-1, visited a manifest injustice on defendant. The charge as given did not inform the jury that the money received by defendant had to have been understood as a quid pro quo for the performance of defendant's services, but merely in connection with such performance, which was a criterion distinctly different from the statutory element of culpability. The jury here could very well have convicted defendant on the court's charge without believing the money was paid and received in return for defendant's performance of his duties.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:87-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant performed an illegal abortion on a minor child in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:87-1. Defendant was convicted of performing an abortion without lawful justification and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Defendant contended, among other things, that &sect; 2A:87-1 had been invalidated, was impermissibly vague, and that she did not contribute to the delinquency of a minor because an abortion was not illegal, or immoral. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that, because defendant was a layperson who had committed an abortion, &sect; 2A:87-1 could be applied to her without any violation of the constitution or any case law which invalidated its provisions. The court further held that defendant could not have possibly been unaware that the term without lawful justification, as used in &sect; 2A:87-1, at the very least meant that an abortion had to be performed by a licensed physician in the exercise of his medical judgment. Therefore, defendant was not permitted to introduce evidence to justify her actions. The court concluded that defendant had committed a willful act, which encouraged or had a tendency to cause the minor to engage in a delinquent act.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant was not entitled to a new trial because the New Jersey abortion statute had not been invalidated, and defendant's conduct encouraged the minor to engage in a delinquent act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court found that defendant township had unlawfully excluded low and moderate income families from the municipality by means of its zoning ordinance, and ordered affirmative relief, which did not include provision for persons who were not residents. The court certified the resulting appeal and cross-appeal prior to argument in the appellate court, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court, with modifications. The court found that under the zoning restrictions, only single-family homes and expensive multi-family housing could be built. The reason for this course of conduct was to keep down local taxes on property. While a municipality could consider that factor in its zoning decisions, it could not make it impossible to provide low and moderate income housing in the municipality. The court held it inherent in N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1, that all police power enactments had to conform to the basic constitutional requirements of substantive due process and equal protection of the laws. Further, its obligation to afford the opportunity for adequate low and moderate income housing extended at least to its fair share of the present and prospective regional need therefor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff candidates had been unsuccessful at a primary election in which they sought a variety of elected positions.

The trial court denied plaintiffs' action for declaratory judgment and ruled in favor of defendant, which was affirmed by the appellate court. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court and held that plaintiffs' challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 19:49-2 was without merit because &sect; 19:49-2 did not treat any of the candidates in a preferential manner, which would have deprived plaintiffs of their constitutional rights to equal protection of the law.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the ordinance was constitutional, because it made clear the activity intended to be regulated and the persons to be brought within its ambit by addressing the door-to-door ventures of charitable solicitors, political campaigners and advocates on behalf of political causes. The court held that the requirement for enactment was met, because the ordinance was plainly an identification device in its most basic form. The court determined that the ordinance's identification requirements were a reasonable means of protecting the municipality's residents against a sense of unease and dangers reasonably to be apprehended on account of strangers that filtered through the community.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, city mayor and others, passed a municipal ordinance which required a certain minimum floor area for each dwelling unit based on the number of occupants. Appellant resident brought suit, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional. Respondents obtained a summary judgment at trial. Appellant sought review, during the pendency of which he moved to a different municipality. The lower court affirmed the trial court judgment. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment and dismissed the appeal. The court held that the procedural history of the case counseled against deciding it because the summary judgment record and contentions on the novel and very far-reaching question presented were so unsatisfactory that the court could not be confident of reaching the correct result. The court assumed that the ordinance was a legitimate exercise of police power in the interest of public health and that N.J. Stat. Ann. 40:48-2 had delegated such power to municipalities. However, the court found that, because the consequences concerned so fundamental an area, the ordinance should neither be struck down nor validated, as truly vital aspects had not been presented or considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment in favor of respondents, mayor and others, and dismissed the appeal as moot because appellant resident no longer had standing to challenge the municipal ordinance under attack and the summary judgment record before the court was insufficient to permit it to resolve the issues raised.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 12A:9-503 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant automobile owner's car was repossessed by respondent bank, and he filed an action for tortious conversion. He also sought a declaratory judgment that the provisions allowing secured parties to peaceably repossess their property under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12A:9-503 was unconstitutional. Respondent filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted, and appellant challenged it. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment. The court initially noted respondent's stipulation that its repossession was based on private contractual rights and was not under the authority of &sect; 12A:9-503, so that there was no state involvement. Further, absent extraordinary circumstances, a court could not declare provisions for self-help repossession in the parties' contract unconscionable pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because that amendment merely preserved values and rights under the common law. Therefore, the court concluded, appellant's option not to pay and respondent's option to retrieve its automobile did not involve a breach of a fundamental right and judicial intervention itself, in such a private contractual issue, would encroach on the parties' fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that granted respondent bank summary judgment on appellant automobile owner's cause of action for tortious conversion was affirmed, because respondent's option to retrieve its goods involved no breach of a fundamental right, nor state participation, but was a private contractual relationship in which court interference was not legally permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent husband commenced a cause of action for divorce on the basis of the adultery he alleged appellants, wife and neighbor, committed. Appellants, in their responsive pleadings, denied the adultery and appellant wife filed a counterclaim for divorce grounded on extreme cruelty. Respondent submitted interrogatories to appellant neighbor inquiring whether he had ever had sexual relations with appellant wife. Appellants refused to answer, claiming their privilege against self-incrimination, and respondent filed a motion to strike the pleadings. Upon the granting of respondent's motion, appellants sought review and the court reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded the case to the trial court. The court reasoned that the sanction of striking the pleadings and, in effect, rendering a default judgment against appellants, was too harsh a penalty for their exercise of their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Despite the fact that the trial court was entitled to imply guilt from appellants' invoking their privilege not to incriminate themselves, the trial court had a broad range of sanctions, short of default, for appellants' refusal to provide discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant town sought a tax rebate or credit from respondent county of a sum equal to three-fourths of the county tax rate applied to the entire amount of ratables in the appellant's boundaries subject to taxation for specified years. Appellant's claim was made under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-5, which allowed such rebates where the county or state owned or occupied land in excess of 200 acres within the town. The division of tax appeals denied appellant's requested relief, which was affirmed by the appellate court, on the grounds that appellant had failed to establish that there were more than 200 acres occupied by a state or county institution, because large sections of property owned by respondent were unused. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed, holding that while appellant was allowed to aggregate the acreage of the separate state and county holdings within its borders, the term &quot;occupying&quot; as used in &sect; 54:4-5 meant something more than mere ownership of the land and connoted actual governmental use. The court found that relief under &sect; 54:4-5 should bear some relationship to the burden sustained.</SPAN></P>

Respondent citizens filed a complaint alleging that the pamphlet violated the provisions of N.J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the United States Supreme Court's vacating defendants' convictions for the possession and sale of obscene publications in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-2 (1969) and its remand to the Appellate Division (New Jersey), the court certified the cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court enumerated a number of categories that it defined as &quot;obscene&quot; in order to infuse the standards in Miller v. California into New Jersey's obscenity statute so as to sustain its constitutionality. The court applied the standard prospectively and reversed defendants' convictions under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-1.1 (1969). The court declared that articles and publications, which were patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, and patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals, were &quot;obscene&quot; under &sect; 2A:115-1.1. A defendant could be convicted if the trier of fact found that (1) the material depicted or described, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct described above; (2) to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appealed to the prurient interest in such matters; and (3) the material, taken as a whole, lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendants' convictions on charges that they possessed and sold obscene publications in violation of New Jersey's obscenity statute because the statute did not comply with the test enunciated in Miller v. California. The court announced its definition of &quot;obscene&quot; material and applied that definition prospectively.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that plaintiff's credit plan was a revolving charge account and the requirements of the Retail Installment Sales Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:16C-1 et seq., were inapplicable. The ability to pay the entire balance in one installment, the interest calculations, and the fact that defendant could purchase items on the account without applying for new credit each time, were all features of revolving charge accounts. Plaintiff 's security interest in the goods did not convert the plan to an installment contract. The court noted that cross collateral arrangements were not per se unconscionable, but in any event, the plan did not create such an arrangement. All of the goods were seized because the first item purchased had not been fully paid for. The replevin statute in effect at the time did not require that defendant receive notice and a hearing prior to seizure of the goods.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted respondent a divorce on those grounds and ordered an equitable distribution of property acquired during the marriage, as well as support for respondent.

The court affirmed, holding that under N.J. Stat.

The court deferred to the trial judge on the finding of extreme cruelty, since he was in a better position to determine whether or not it was reasonable to expect respondent to continue to cohabit with appellant.

Also, defendant urged that if the statute was interpreted retrospectively, as to apply to any property interest acquired before that date, it had to be stricken as unconstitutional because it would then deprive defendant of property without due process of law. Plaintiff opposed the contentions, taking the position that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court vacated and remanded the judgment allocating the marital assets. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:34-23 was not unconstitutional because a state in the exercise of its police power could enact a statute, regardless of its retroactive effect, to promote the public health, safety, morals or general welfare.

The ordinance was declared unconstitutional as it applied to the premises of plaintiffs, owners and contract vendee. On appeal, the court affirmed and modified the judgment, and remanded to the trial court, holding that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the finding that the prohibition against further garden apartments was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs' property. The immediate area was so studded with apartment and business uses, leaving it as an isolated island, that it could not reasonably be used for single family dwelling purposes and to so require would be arbitrary. The court found that the conclusion of arbitrariness and invalidity was sufficiently grounded legally and factually. The facts showed that while plaintiffs' lot could theoretically be utilized for the erection of four one-family dwellings, they would be difficult to market at a fair price in view of the immediate surroundings.

The court held that the statute did not provide an exception for employers who were in the business of dispensing narcotics and dangerous drugs. The court rejected defendant's contention that its request that various employees take polygraph tests was not a condition of employment or continued employment within the statutory contemplation. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the statute deprived it of its property without due process of law by preventing it from taking necessary steps towards reducing its losses from theft. The court held that the statute was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power because the use of the polygraph involved matters of evidential reliability and industrial conflict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudged legally insane and incapable of standing trial for shooting a police officer. Defendant suffered from schizophrenia, an incurable disease. After a year of commitment, defendant's disease was in remission and he sought to be released. The trial court refused to release defendant as it found he was not &quot;restored to reason&quot; under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:163-2, and the appellate division affirmed. The court held that if a defendant were required to be committed until an incurable disease was cured, he would face a life sentence. The court held remission was insufficient to require a complete release as the underlying illness was not neutralized. However, the court held the right to treatment under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4-24.1 required consideration of alternatives to commitment. The court reversed the judgment below and remanded to the trial court for a hearing on the propriety of a conditional release.

On appeal the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. 34:11-56.25 et seq., was not a true prevailing wage statute since non-union wages were not used in determining the wage rate. Only the wages fixed in collective bargaining agreements in the locality for the particular craft or trade were used. The court stated that the result was that the parties who negotiated the collective bargaining agreements also established the statutory wage rate for public works in the locality. The court held that the delegation of legislative power to private parties was not per se unconstitutional. The test was whether the particular delegation was reasonable under the circumstances considering the purpose and aim of the statute. The court affirmed the judgment because the parties negotiating the collective bargaining agreements were competing groups with opposing economic positions, so that the agreements reached represent a balancing of interests.</SPAN></P>

The chancery division struck down the arrangement, holding the arrangement was an installment contract, not a lease, and the state lacked authority to enter such an arrangement.

The court, agreeing with the chancery division to the extent that appellants would be without statutory power to enter into the transaction unless the transaction was a bona fide lease, not in contravention of the constitutional debt limitation, found that the arrangement was a bona fide lease.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, tort defendants, challenged the validity of a New Jersey court rule which authorized prejudgment interest in tort actions, alleging that prejudgment interest was a matter of substantive law and, thus, beyond the rule-making power granted to the courts governing practice and procedure in courts under U.S. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, para. 3. Appellants insisted that the court breached the principle of separation of powers embodied in U.S. Const. art. III, &sect;1, by adopting the rule, and that the rule could not be applied retrospectively. The court affirmed, holding the constitutionally granted rule-making power did not deal with substantive law, or with the court's responsibility as to substantive law. Prejudgment interest was a matter of procedure within court's rule-making responsibility. Appellants were not denied equal protection by the rule, which was limited to tort actions, as tort actions were a distinctive class of litigation. Retroactive application of judge-made rules was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's decision not to zone plaintiffs' property on the same commercial basis as a large shopping center, and to retain the properties' preexisting residential zoning classification, was free from unreasonableness or arbitrariness and, therefore, valid on its face. The court stated that a property owner was not entitled to have his property zoned for its most profitable use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certifying six consolidated cases that were pending in the lower court, the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30.4-155, governing the sentencing of female offenders, was unconstitutional. Under the statute, it noted, a female offender would be sentenced to an indeterminate term while a male convicted of the same offense would be sentenced to a minimum-maximum term. Finding that the statute affected a fundamental constitutional right, that of liberty, the court held that the rationale for the different sentences, that females were better subjects for rehabilitation and that this justified a potentially longer period of detention, could not withstand the close judicial scrutiny required where a fundamental right was involved. It ordered that the six appellants, who were female prisoners, be resentenced and that other female inmates who were eligible for minimum-maximum sentences have the option of changing to these sentences or staying with the indeterminate sentences imposed. It rejected the arguments of four of the appellants that their custodial sentences were manifestly excessive, finding no evidence in the record to support their claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee filed a claim for benefits against respondent employer because he was injured while working. Petitioner's principal duty was driving and operating a forklift in a warehouse located on the dock. However, petitioner was injured in the hold of a ship while unhooking cargo. The division of workmen's compensation dismissed his claim under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:15-1 et seq. because the injuries were not on land. At issue was whether petitioner's exclusive remedy was under the federal Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq. The court considered the extent of the constitutional reach of the state's workmen's compensation statute over injuries occurring on navigable waters. In the instant case, the employment relationship was an important factor in determining whether the state or federal law applied. Petitioner was a land-based workman with almost all of his duties performed on land. Thus, the court held that there was no constitutional barrier to the award of state benefits because there was no showing that such award would substantially interfere with the federal maritime interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought suit against defendant state officials, contending that the state system of financing public education was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs argued that the existing system violated the equal protection mandates of the federal and state constitutions because it discriminated against students in poorer districts and also discriminated among taxpayers. The trial court agreed, holding that the system also violated other provisions of the state constitution relating to public education and to the assessment of real property for taxation. The trial court concluded that the state had to finance the system out of state revenues raised by levies imposed uniformly on taxpayers of the same class. Defendants appealed. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the system was unconstitutional because the constitutional demand for an equal educational opportunity for all children was not met where there were large discrepancies per pupil expenditures. The court modified the remedy, however, allowing the state to authorize the local governments to levy tax, provided that such authorization did not become a device for diluting the state's mandated responsibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution and defendant appealed the order from the Superior Court Appellate Division (New Jersey) which affirmed defendant's sodomy conviction but reversed defendant's rape conviction, remanding that issue for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of rape and sodomy. Upon appeal, the lower court affirmed the sodomy conviction but reversed the rape conviction and remanded that issue for a new trial. The lower court reversed the rape conviction because the trial court did not, either in its charge or at any other point during defendant's trial, instruct the jury that evidence of defendant's prior criminal convictions, which had been introduced, must only be considered for credibility. Both defendant and the prosecution appealed the lower court's ruling. The court affirmed the lower court's handling of the sodomy conviction, but reversed its ruling on the rape conviction. The court concluded that the trial court's error of failing to properly instruct the jury regarding the prior criminal conviction was considered harmless error. The court's decision was based upon the overwhelming nature of the testimony pointing to defendant's guilt and the relative insignificance of the testimonial references to his prior convictions. The court found the sodomy statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, the statute included and prohibited heterosexual acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the lower court's order reversing defendant's rape conviction, and the judgment of conviction was reinstated, because the trial court's error in failing to charge or instruct the jury that evidence of defendant's prior convictions was only to be considered for credibility was harmless error. In all other respects the order of the lower court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the Fourth of July, defendant painted the peace symbol on two American flags and displayed them on the side of his ice cream truck. Defendant was convicted of defacing the flag in violation of the New Jersey Flag Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:107-1, which provided that any person who affixed any inscription, design, device, symbol, name, advertisement, words, characters, marks, notice, or token of any nature whatsoever to the United States flag was guilty of a misdemeanor. On review, the court found that, historically, &sect; 2A:107-1 was aimed at commercial misuse of the flag. The court held that &sect; 2A:107-1 was unconstitutionally overbroad as it prohibited the traditional as well as the extreme, the patriotic as well as the nonpatriotic, and the communicative as well as the noncommunicative. The court found that there was no legitimate government interest that was served by &sect; 2A:107-1. The court found that &sect; 2A:107-1 gave too much discretion to local officials to determine what expression was tolerated, as political candidates could go unpunished, but peace demonstrators could be prosecuted. The court reversed the order and directed the indictment against defendant be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court entered judgment for defendant commissioner of labor.

The court assumed that the Legislature had found there was no threat of separation of powers, and the court had to accept that evaluation unless it was plainly wrong.

Although the court determined that plaintiffs were in no legal position to attack the ordinance once the appellate court construed it in their favor, the court subscribed to the appellate court's construction and affirmed its judgment.

On appeal as of right, the court affirmed, but modified the judgment to set aside the death sentence, as the death penalty under that statute had since been declared unconstitutional, and imposed a life sentence. Appellant also asserted that identification evidence was erroneously admitted because the procedure used was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. First, the court held there was no error in the admission of the photographic identifications on the ground that they were conducted in the absence of counsel because his right to counsel attached only after adversary judicial proceedings had been initiated against him. Further, the photographic lineups resulting in appellant's identification were not impermissibly suggestive, based on the totality of the circumstances.

The death penalty provision of the New Jersey homicide statute was determined to be invalid. Respondent renewed his motion for bail because if he was found guilty of murder in the first degree he could not be sentenced to death. The motion was granted and a further hearing ordered to fix the amount of bail. On the state's application, the court stayed the proceeding and granted leave to appeal. The court affirmed the order. The court found that the record made on the bail hearing in the trial court would not constitutionally support a denial of bail. Since the crime for which respondent was indicted was no longer a capital offense he was entitled to pretrial release. Additionally, since the trial court imposed no conditions and none were suggested to the court as necessary, there appeared to be no ground for appellate interference with the trial court's order releasing respondent on bail pending trial.</SPAN></P>

Summary judgment motions by the asphalt company and its successor were granted on the ground that plaintiff's action was barred by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-1.1. The appellate division reversed. The court reinstated the trial court's dismissal, holding that where a claim for redress was based upon negligent injury to person or property, the cause of action accrued when there had been a negligent act with proximately resulting injury or damage. Plaintiff's cause of action did not arise until she fell and sustained an injury. That was many years after the 10-year period fixed by the statute had expired. Thus an injury occurring more than 10 years after the negligent act allegedly responsible for the harm, namely, paving the road, formed no basis for recovery. The court found that the statute neither deprived plaintiff of due process nor violated equal protection because it bore a reasonable relationship to the purposes sought to be served by the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:118-1, and numerous other crimes. He entered a woman's apartment and forced her to drive him to the next town at gunpoint whereupon he shot her in the arm. The next day defendant was being questioned by police on a matter related to a stolen car and made a confession after he was confronted with evidence linking him to the kidnapping and shooting of the woman. The court affirmed the Appellate Division's disposition of this case. Although the trial court charged the jury that they were required to first determine if defendant's confession was voluntary, the trial court did not charge the jury with respect to the requirement that defendant be given Miranda warnings. The court held that the trial court, as a question involving the competency of evidence, properly took up the question of Miranda warnings. The court reinterpreted N.J. Evid. R. 8(3) in light of Miranda to permit a return from the &quot;Massachusetts&quot; rule to the orthodox rule for the admissibility of confessions. The court affirmed the Appellate Division's decision to resentence defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Division, which affirmed defendant's conviction and modified the sentence imposed on him. The court remanded to the trial court for entry of the corrected sentence. The court held that questions relating to the issuance of Miranda warnings were properly taken up by the trial court as a matter relating to the competency of evidence.</SPAN></P>

On review, appellant County Board of Elections contended that this decision was against the weight of authority. The court affirmed finding that respondents had been subjected as a class to questioning beyond all other applicants, including applicants who were freely registered, though their situations indicated that they were comparably short-term residents of their communities; and their applications for registration were rejected though they established that they actually lived at their campus residences, were interested in and concerned with the communities in which their campus residences were located, and asserted in good faith their purpose of voting there and no place else.

The warrant directed seizure of any material found by police to violate &sect; 2A: 115-2, and contained no guidelines as to the kinds of items to be taken. The court held that the warrant did not meet the particularity requirements of N.J. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9 and U.S. Const. amend.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant's inculpatory statements were not improperly received in evidence. There was no basis for defendant's contention that the jury had not been instructed to decide whether his statements had been made because the jury had in fact been given that instruction several times. The court found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in having a portion of the confession read to the jury during deliberations at the jury's request. The court also held that in-court identifications were not tainted by impermissibly suggestive out-of-court identifications because a one-on-one identification made within a reasonable short time after the crime was sanctioned, as was a chance encounter provoking spontaneous recognition. Thus, defendant's points were without merit.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:10-1. The trial court held the statute, which provided for the building of a sports complex funded by the issuance of bonds and supported by the revenues generated, was constitutional. The court affirmed. The court held the sports complex served a public interest. N.J. Const. art. 8, &sect; II, para. 2, the appropriations clause, was not violated by the statute. It was proper for only a tiny percentage of profits from the complex to be turned over the state because the allocation was projected to be $ 1,700,000 annually and was reasonable revenue for support of the government. The court also held the statute did not violate N.J. Const. art. 8, &sect; II, para. 3, the debt limitation clause. The issuance of bonds to raise money needed for the complex was within the authority provided by statute. The bonds clearly indicated that any debts resulting from their issuance did not become state debts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its original ruling, the court found that N.J. Stat.

Following remand to the chancery court, the court affirmed its prior decision as the constitutionality of the prohibition on tied-houses, but ruled that the grandfather clause was unconstitutional. The court then held that the grandfather clause could not be severed from the tied-house prohibition. The court observed that the removal of the grandfather clause would not impair the principal object of &sect; 33:1-43, noting that by creating an exception, the grandfather clause was at odds with the provision's purpose in banning tied-houses. Nonetheless, the court ruled that severance was improper because, based on the large number of wholesales subject to the grandfather clause, it could not be determined that it was the legislature's intent to permit the tied-house prohibition to stand alone.

In so ruling, the court rejected defendant's argument he was denied the right to counsel because he was not permitted to interview state witnesses. The court ruled that this argument was not factually established because defendant was able to have his counsel interview one witness, while others refused to speak with him. Moreover, noting that this argument was not raised in the trial court, the court ruled that it was not available on post-conviction review. Similarly, the court ruled that defendant's argument that his defense was unlawfully frustrated by the trial court's instruction on intoxication should have been raised on direct appeal. Finally, the court ruled that defendant's challenge to the death qualified jury was no longer valid because the death penalty was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Upon remand, the court heard argument on all death penalty cases. The court held that the death penalty set forth in N.J. Stat.

The court determined that the legislature would want the rest of the statute to stand if the death penalty failed. The court ordered that in all causes where the death penalty had been assessed, an order would be entered sentencing appellants to life imprisonment nunc pro tunc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of first degree murder. One defendant was sentenced to death, and the other was sentenced to life imprisonment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, as modified. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a change of venue. In so ruling, the court found no evidence of prejudice, noting that the pretrial publicity occurred more than eight months before trial, and defendants did not even utilize all of their preemptory challenges. The court also ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial after it was discovered that a juror, who was eventually excused, had a prior relationship with the prosecutor. The court ruled that there was no evidence that the juror's limited presence on the jury contaminated the panel. Moreover, the court observed that the motion was based on the non-existent right to have 14 jurors. Finally, the court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in introducing color photographs of the slain police officer. In light of the entire record, the court found that this admission did not prejudice defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction for first degree murder because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying motions for change of venue and mistrial, and in admitting photographs of the victim. The court affirmed the life sentence given to one defendant, but changed the death sentence given to the second defendant to life imprisonment because the New Jersey death penalty statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 18A:72A-1 et seq., was designed to provide funds to finance the construction of dormitories and educational facilities for public and private institutions of higher education. The court previously held that the statute did not offend the church-state provision of the U.S. Const. amend. I. The United States Supreme Court vacated and remanded the decision for reconsideration. On reconsideration, the court held that the statute's legislative purpose was wholly secular. The court also found that the statute could not be struck down on the theory of excessive entanglement with religion. Further, the court concluded that the statute dictated the facility would never be used for sectarian purposes. Moreover, the court held that no college could participate if it restricted entry on racial or religious grounds or required all students gaining admission to receive instruction in the tenets of a particular faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was identified by the murder victim's maid as the man who stood over the victim with a knife in his hand. The victim died from knife wounds. Defendant's sister-in-law reported to the police the substance of some disturbing phone calls from defendant. In discussing newspaper coverage of the murder, defendant admitted to his sister-in-law that he committed the murder and revealed details that only the guilty party would have known. At trial, the telephone conversations were admitted into evidence. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, he initially argued that his sister-in-law's testimony regarding the phone conversations constituted inadmissible hearsay. The court found that the accounts of the phone calls were admissible as direct or inferential admissions by defendant that he committed the murder. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that the maid's identification of him was the result of impermissibly suggestive photographs. The court rejected defendant's remaining contentions on appeal and affirmed the guilty verdict but it also withheld final judgment pending guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting and sentencing defendant for murder in the first degree was affirmed, because his sister-in-law's testimony of phone conversations with defendant was admissible as direct or inferential admissions that defendant committed the murder. However, the court reserved entry of final judgment until it could review arguments regarding the death penalty after the U.S. Supreme Court issued decisions in some relevant pending cases.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's owner was substituted as judgment debtor nunc pro tunc. The lower court denied appellant's owner's motion that he be committed to jail pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:40-67. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment as modified, reducing the judgment because the fine imposed was a disproportionate amount to be exacted for the illegal erection and maintenance of about a dozen signs. The court held that although &sect; 54:40-67 offered alternative penalties, it was not for the owner to decide which would be chosen. The court concluded that that under &sect; 54:40-67, a jail sentence was an available sanction to aid in enforcing the law, to be invoked by the lower court as it saw fit and was not intended to afford an avenue of relief to the violator.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the bonds authorized by the act did not become the obligations of the state and that the statute did not impose upon the state a legally binding or enforceable obligation to pay them or to reimburse the county upon its making payment. The court determined that, although there was a strong likelihood that payment of the bonds would in fact be met by legislative appropriations, there was nothing in the statute compelling the state to make such payments as a matter of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county court denied plaintiff husband and wife's application for a final decree of adoption on the ground that plaintiffs' lack of belief in a Supreme Being rendered them unfit to be adoptive parents. Plaintiffs had filed an application for adoption after receiving approval from a children's aid and adoption society for adoption of a baby girl. The county court denied the application solely on the basis of plaintiffs' professed lack of belief in a Supreme Being and absence of religious affiliation. Plaintiffs appealed to the appellate division. Prior to argument there, the state supreme court certified the case on its own motion. The state supreme court held that religion could be coupled with other considerations when determining the advisability of granting an adoption of a child; however, the religious factor could not be controlling. To condition adoption on church affiliation violated plaintiffs' right to free exercise of religion under U.S. Const. amend. I. Because the county court denied the adoption solely because of plaintiffs' lack of religious belief, the county court erred, and the decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court ruled for plaintiffs in their damage claims against a city following racial disturbances. The court, on appeal, rejected the city's contention that the mob and riot statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:48-1 to -7, was arbitrary and, thus, unconstitutional. Despite the city's contention of insufficient evidence of a causal connection between the riot and plaintiffs' damage claims, the court found sufficient evidence to go to the jury. The statute also covered losses due to looting. However, the court said, insurance carriers that covered the losses could not be subrogated to their insureds' claims and, thus, judgments to this effect needed to modified accordingly. Finally, it was not error to transfer one suit from a county district court to superior court so that it could be pursued in larger amount and in excess of the county district court's jurisdiction. The transfer of a case so that it could be tried with cases arising out of the same event was proper. Even if the transfer occurred more than three months after the loss, the issue of the claim's enlargement being barred by the limitation period was academic because the entire claim might fail on account of subrogation.</SPAN></P>

Interlocutory judgments were entered. The Appellate Division granted a motion and a cross-motion for leave to appeal and the New Jersey Supreme Court certified the appeals before argument there. The Supreme Court rejected appellant's attack on the constitutionality of the statute. Further appellant contention that there was no evidence of a riot was meritless. The jury's finding of riot was well supported by the proofs. The Supreme Court did agree with appellant's final point that insurance carriers should have been denied subrogation to their insureds' claims. Accordingly, the interlocutory judgment was modified in that regard. On respondent's cross-appeal, they challenged the trial court's factual finding that appellant was not negligent. As held in previous case law, a claim of negligence would not lie. Hence, the interlocutory judgments were affirmed in part and modified in part.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found against plaintiffs as to the establishment issue, but for them with respect to their equal protection complaint. On appeal, the court found that the applicable statute did not deny equal protection of the laws, because it provided transportation only to private school students who resided in districts that were required to furnish transportation to the public schools.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residents sought to have the Commissioner of Education take suitable steps towards preventing respondent township from withdrawing its students from the local high school and towards effectuating a merger of respondent and another school system. The Commissioner was of the opinion that, even though such steps were highly desirable from an educational standpoint and to avoid racial imbalance, he lacked legal authority to take them, and accordingly, he dismissed appellants' petition. Appellants filed a notice of appeal to the appellate division and the court certified the argument for review. The court found that on examining the statutory terms of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:38-13, there was nothing to support the Commissioner's restrictive construction. Therefore it was evident that the Commissioner erred in dismissing, for lack of legal authority, appellants' petition and a town's cross-petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city redevelopment authority appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Division (New Jersey) that affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants, state attorney general and private parties. Plaintiffs attacked the statutory provision that fixed the value of property at the time it was declared blighted pursuant to redevelopment projects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Jersey's legislature enacted statutes providing that for purposes of condemnation proceedings in redevelopment projects a property's value would be fixed at an amount no less than its value at the time it was declared &quot;blighted.&quot; Plaintiff city redevelopment authority asserted that the statutes violated U.S. Const. amend. V, and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 20. Plaintiff asserted that the determination of an amount representing just compensation was a judicial function, and that the legislature had no power to impose an arbitrary and binding rule. The appellate court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants, the state attorney general and private parties. Plaintiff petitioned the court, which affirmed the judgment. The court found that the statutes properly protected landowners by assuring them that they would receive at least the value the property had when it was declared blighted rather than whatever its diminished value was, perhaps years later, when it was finally taken for redevelopment purposes. The court noted that if the value was greater when the property was finally taken the owner would receive the greater amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the intermediate court's judgement that affirmed the summary judgment granted defendants, the state attorney general and private parties. The court ruled that the statutes that provided a floor under which the value of property declared &quot;blighted&quot; could not fall did not violate the U.S. or New Jersey constitutions. The court found the statutes properly protected landowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal resulted from litigation arising out of the issuance a building permit for the erection of a building by intervenor restaurant on lands leased by it from defendant landowner. Plaintiff neighbors claimed that a zoning ordinance provision prohibited the building permit. Intervenor sought a declaratory judgment that the ordinance provision was unconstitutional, that estoppel precluded plaintiffs' attack, and that it obtained a nonconforming use against the applicability of a later adopted ordinance because it began construction before plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and before the later ordinance was adopted. The court rejected intervenor's arguments, finding that no right arose as against a subsequent prohibitory ordinance when the acts relied upon took place prior to the issuance of the building permit. The court modified the judgment of the appellate division, finding that the appellate division should not have considered the constitutional argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment of the appellate division so that it was limited to a declaration that the site plan approval and building permit were valid; that no estoppel arose by reason of the requirement to demolish the prior building; that the later zoning ordinance amendment controlled; and that intervenor restaurant acquired no rights by reason of the commencement of construction prior to the enactment of the later ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful use of a narcotic drug. Pursuant to statute the trial court suspended defendant's driver's license in addition to the other sanctions it imposed. Defendant appealed from that part of the judgment that suspended her license. She argued that the suspension was illegal because her offense was unrelated to her operation of a motor vehicle. On its own motion the court certified the appeal for its consideration. The court reversed the license suspension and remanded the case. The court rejected defendant's argument that the suspension violated her rights guaranteed under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that the legislature had the prerogative to treat different classes of offenders differently so long as there was a rational basis for doing so. The court reviewed the statutory scheme and ruled that whether the license forfeiture provision was deemed a punitive sanction or was a measure to protect motorists on the public highways, it did not violate the rights asserted by defendant. The court ordered the suspension reviewed, however, because the statute that permitted it was repealed while the appeal was pending.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from a trial court (New Jersey), which convicted defendant of murder on the first degree and sentenced him to death. Among other claims, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The prosecutor recommended that the sentence be reduced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. Defendant argued that the evidence did not warrant a finding beyond second-degree murder or that the finding of first-degree murder was against the weight of the evidence. The state recommended that the sentence be amended to life imprisonment. The court found that the judgment was free from error. Viewing the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the state, the degree of murder had to be sent to the jury, and the evidence supported the jury's finding of first-degree murder. Claims of error with respect to the adjudication of guilt and the imposition of the death penalty similarly lacked merit. Nevertheless, the prosecutor's authority to decline the death penalty did not expire with the jury's verdict so long as the judgment remained subject to direct review. If defendant had not, through absurd behavior, unwittingly contributed to a disastrous defense that tarnished the truth of the killing, the death penalty would probably not have been imposed. Therefore, the court modified the sentence to life imprisonment and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the sentence of the death penalty to life imprisonment and affirmed the judgment as modified.

The two municipalities divided a proportionate share of the regional high school costs and the operating costs for the regional elementary school district. Respondent brought a declaratory judgment action seeking the costs for the district to be apportioned on the basis of assessed valuations rather than under the per pupil formula established by a statute, L. 1965, c. 175. The question also arose whether the law constituted special legislation because it apparently only applied to appellant's and respondent's high school district. On review, the court found that the classification imposed by the statute lacked a reasonable nexus to the objects of the statute, and thus constituted special legislation rather than a general enactment. The court held that because the statute was not adopted as a special law following public notice of intention to apply for the enactment thereof as required by the Constitution, the act contravened N.J.

Appellants argued that the resolution was in bad faith, was not motivated by the declared policy of the statute, and was designed to take their property. Holding the concept of the public welfare was broad and inclusive, the appellate court affirmed the order validating the blight declaration because there was no reasonable basis for challenging appellees' decision that the land should be developed in a homogenous fashion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff incumbent candidate began inquiring whether defendant challenger was qualified to hold the office of tax assessor before the primary election. The position required a tax assessor's certificate, which required passing an examination open to applicants with a college degree or work experience. After the last exam before the general election, plaintiff received confirmation that defendant did not possess a certificate. Plaintiff brought a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writ. The trial court entered judgment ordering defendant's name removed from the ballot. The appellate court reversed because plaintiff's application was timely. Defendant was elected. On appeal, the court held that plaintiff's action was timely under the limitation period for actions in lieu of prerogative writs, which was tolled until plaintiff received definite word of defendant's ineligibility. The court held that a college education was reasonably related to needs of the office of municipal tax assessor. Because no candidate other than plaintiff held a certificate, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment, reinstated the trial court's order, and held that plaintiff could take the office.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's constitutional attack on the qualifications because a college education was rationally related to the needs of a tax assessor. Affirming the trial court's decision, the court ruled that plaintiff assumed the office.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant claimed various legal errors, the supreme court found that defendant's guilt was established by a full and fair trial and affirmed the finding of guilt. The supreme court held that the jury which imposed defendant's death sentence was constitutionally deficient as partial and unrepresentative on the issue of punishment as distinguished from guilt because veniremen were excused simply for their opposition to the death penalty. The supreme court found that when the sole error in a trial was a sentencing error it had the power to modify the sentence and reduce the death penalty to life imprisonment. The state waived its right to seek the death penalty. The supreme court modified defendant's death sentence to life imprisonment because the trial court excused prospective jurors for cause simply on their statement that they were opposed to the death penalty and as such, the death sentence fixed by the jury was unrepresentative and constitutionally deficient and as modified, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant defendant, along with several other young men, were involved in an affair and subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit fornication and fornication. Defendant was found guilty of both charges and was sentenced to four to five months imprisonment on the fornication and received a suspended sentence on the conspiracy. Upon certification to the court, the court held that the facts did not support a conspiracy conviction and the judgment on that charge was reversed. Defendant argued the fornication statute was an invasion of privacy protected by the U.S. Constitution. Additionally, defendant asserted that if fornication in private could have been punished, the offense should include the birth of issue. The court noted there was a problem with uneven enforcement of the fornication statute. Moreover, the court suggested that the offense be downgraded by statute to a disorderly persons offense. Further, the court held that while fornication was denounced as a misdemeanor, the punishment was characteristic of disorderly persons offenses, and assessed punishment to a suspended jail term and one-year probation.</SPAN></P>

VI. The appellate court affirmed and found that defendant failed to object at trial and did not find plain error in the context of the prosecutor's entire summation. Defendant sought further review and argued that the appellate court utilized the wrong standard of review for his constitutional error. The court found that defendant's belated assertion of his constitutional right to counsel was not an error of constitutional gravity because defendant was not entitled to counsel prior to his arrest. Moreover, defendant did not satisfy procedural requirements because he failed to object in a timely manner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant New Jersey State Board of Examiners of Ophthalmic Dispensers and Ophthalmic Technicians adopted a rule preventing dispensers and technicians, as defined by N.J.

Plaintiff Ohio corporation, which sought to sell eyeglasses, lenses, frames, and related items in New Jersey department stores, challenged the rule's validity, contending that it did not protect public health and safety, was not within the scope of defendant's statutory authority, and was unconstitutional because it denied plaintiff equal protection of the law. On appeal, the court reversed the lower courts' decisions upholding the rule, because the rule did not upon its face come within the ambit of defendant's authority, and the apparent consequence of prospectively preventing a licensed dispenser from practicing except in his own name effectively prevented everyone other than a licensed dispenser from participating in the ophthalmic business, which did not further the public purpose of N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment affirming the validity of a rule of defendant New Jersey State Board of Examiners of Ophthalmic Dispensers and Ophthalmic Technicians was reversed, because the requirement that ophthalmic dispensers practice only in their own names was not within defendant's statutory authority and had the effect of limiting competition, favoring one group of merchants over another.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a settlement facility director who was involved in the lives of many Trenton High School students who frequented his facility. Defendant was found guilty of entering the school with the intent to disrupt classes and otherwise interfere with the peace and good order after he entered the school during a student demonstration, was loud and boisterous, and did not leave until a state trooper asked him to leave. On appeal the court affirmed his conviction. The jury could reasonably have inferred from the evidence that defendant intended to support the demonstration and, therefore, entered the building with the intent to disrupt as required for a guilt finding under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:149A-2. Exclusion of students, parents, legal guardians, and school employees from the statute's coverage was rational and did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend.

The court modified the trial court's judgment, finding that the division of the municipality into two sewer districts did not violate &sect; 40:14A-1 et seq., because nothing in that statute required defendant to succeed the existing sewer system. Similarly, the court found that the plan did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend.

The court refrained from deciding whether defendant's capacity charge was valid but held that its scale of annual increasing connection fees was lawful because it was based on a logical policy, ensuring that costs be borne by future potential users, and only rough equality between potential and actual users was required by law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, and he sought review. The court affirmed. The court held that the state's use of defendant's prior criminal record did not infringe upon his right to a fair trial because the state was careful to point out to the jury that the evidence could be considered only as affecting defendant's credibility. Defendant's right to be presumed innocent was not unconstitutionally diluted by remarks in the state's summation, and in the trial court's charge that the jury could consider defendant's interest in the outcome of the case when it adjudged his credibility. When a defendant took the witness stand in a criminal case, he put his character in issue; and it was proper for the state and the trial judge to call attention to his interest in the result. Testimony regarding a co-actor was properly admitted because it was evidence of events that occurred during alleged concerted action. The exclusion of veniremen for cause by reason of their position on capital punishment did not deny defendant a representative jury. The state was entitled to more than a juror who is uncertain whether he could vote for the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly robbed and killed the decedent by deliberately driving a car over him while he lay on the ground, and sought review of his conviction for first degree murder. The court affirmed this conviction but directed that entry of judgment be withheld until further order. The court found no merit to defendant's argument that the judge had improperly charged the jury as to the possibility of entering a manslaughter verdict because the evidence did not support this verdict. Similarly, the court found that the jury was properly instructed as to the felony murder rule because New Jersey followed the res gestae principle regarding that rule, and that there had been no error where the judge had not mentioned the accomplice rule in his charge absent a request by defendant. The court found that the trial judge was permitted to ask veniremen if they would ever support capital punishment. The resolution of questions regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty where the court accepted a non vult plea to a murder indictment and of a jury's determining punishment and guilt in a first degree murder case were delayed pending a decision of the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife was a passenger in defendant husband's automobile when it collided with a third party's vehicle. Plaintiff filed an action against defendant and the third party for negligent operation of a motor vehicle, and the third party filed a cross-claim against defendant. The trial court granted defendant summary judgment on the theory of interspousal immunity. The court reversed an appellate court's decision affirming the summary judgment, and overturned the doctrine of interspousal immunity regarding vehicular negligence actions. The court found that the notion that a husband and wife shared a common legal identity was outdated. Similarly, the court dismissed the idea that interspousal actions disturbed marital harmony, noting that it was equally likely that denying such actions would disturb marital actions. The court was troubled by the possibility of interspousal fraud and collusion, but cited the absence of such collusion in cases involving the host-guest relationship and the lawful action of a wife against a partnership including her husband. The court noted that such fraud and collusion had not arisen in other states permitting interspousal negligence actions.</SPAN></P>

The issues were of public importance and adjudication was in the public interest. The court reversed the trial court and held the program was constitutional and fostered a valid public purpose. The law was valid and the means were reasonably calculated to achieve the purpose of increased housing production. The participating private lenders became agencies that were required to implement the public purpose of the law. Any private gains by the mortgagees were permissible as incidental to the achievement of that purpose.

The court ruled that &sect; 2A:170-29(1) was constitutional because it showed an implicit constitutional purpose, which was to preserve the peace and protect the sensibilities of the people within hearing of the language.

The superior court imposed a fine to act as a deterrent and found that the provision in N.J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that defendant licensed real estate broker had engaged in the unlawful practice of law.

The superior court found defendant guilty for essentially the same reasons and imposed a fine. On review, the court reversed, holding the general intent of the legislature in enacting N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-78 was to aid the judiciary in its regulation of the practice of law. The court found the purpose of 2A:170-81(d) was not to authorize the various practices set forth therein but merely to exempt those practices from the operation of &sect; 2A:170-78. The court held the purpose of &sect; 2A:170-81(d) was controlled by the general purposes of &sect; 2A:170-78. The court held the legislature did not attempt to authorize the practice of law by licensed real estate brokers but merely singled out those acts of a real estate broker which, even if considered the practice of law, would not subject him to criminal punishment. The court held because defendant's actions fell within the statutory exemption, he was not subject to punishment under &sect; 2A:170-78.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislation prohibiting tied houses between manufacturers and wholesalers bore a reasonable relationship to the legislative policies of temperance and stability of the market in an inelastic market. The court stated that tied houses between manufacturers and wholesalers were not so remote from the ultimate consumer that increased sales could not result. The court stated that sales stimulation at the retail level would result in a larger share of the market for plaintiff.

The lower court held that other types of cases involving some degree of causal intermediation between the parties would be appraised on a case by case basis for retroactivity, and plaintiffs recovery of interest on such loans was limited to 6 percent. On appeal, the court ruled defendants were liable for the agreed installment payments to plaintiffs but without interest. Additionally, if the loan transactions resulted from intermediation defendants had no liability on their loans.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant planning board's grant of plaintiff landowners' application for approval of a subdivision of their land in defendant borough was conditioned on their reservation of a right-of-way across the property for the future extension of an existing street that dead-ended at plaintiffs' sideline. The municipal governing body affirmed the condition. Plaintiffs filed suit and judgment was given for defendants. The appellate division affirmed and the court granted certification. Because the proposed extension was not necessary or related to the subdivision defendants could not condition their approval upon a reservation of the right-of-way through plaintiffs' property. To do so would have been a taking of private property without compensation. However, the subdivided lots had no access without the right to use the existing street. Plaintiffs did not have that right. The street extension was required because of the subdivision. Because there was no right to a subdivision where there was no proper street access and plaintiffs were not willing even to reserve the street extension right-of-way, the subdivision application should have been denied. The court affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, officers of the Fireman's Mutual Benevolent Association, sought to temporarily restrain defendants, labor organization and the New Jersey Public Employees Relations Commission, from following the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:13A-1 et seq., specifically N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:13A-7, which provided for a duly elected representative of the majority. The trial court denied plaintiffs' motion and declared the statute constitutional. The exclusive representation right was granted by N.J. Const. art. I, para. 19, and 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 157 provided for the right to self-organization through a representative. The court held that creation of an exclusive representative that represented the entire unit, including those members who did not vote for such representative, was not repugnant with constitutional granting of such right. The court held that collective bargaining implied inherent limitations. The court held that there were differences between public and private employment relations which necessarily affected the characteristics of collective bargaining in the public sector. The court affirmed a judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, corporation and associated individual, were the owners, lessees, or contract purchasers of various parcels of real estate that were adjacent to, but not within the right of way of a state highway. Defendant commissioner of transportation announced his intention to acquire certain lands for highway beautification purposes under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:7-22.4. Plaintiffs commenced an action in lieu of prerogative writs contesting the commissioner's power to condemn lands, on the ground that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:7-22.4 was unconstitutional because it did not contain adequate standards for guidance in the selection of lands to be taken. The lower court dissolved the temporary restraint against defendant, and granted defendant's motion for an interlocutory injunction. Plaintiffs' application for leave to appeal was granted. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court and held that plaintiffs' hypothetical projections of possible abuses were irrelevant as an adequate standard was furnished for a limitation on the exercise of the power of condemnation. The public was protected from an abuse of power or an arbitrary exercise of discretion by recourse to the courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded appellant licensed driver's case to the Division of Motor Vehicles for an administrative hearing to determine whether there was no reasonable possibility of recovery by the driver of the vehicle which appellant hit in an accident. The court held that when respondents, attorney general and director of the Division of Motor Vehicles, notified appellant that her license would be suspended under the Motor Vehicle Security-Responsibility Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6-23, unless she deposited a security, the notice should have informed appellant that she was entitled to an administrative hearing. The court held that if appellant was able to show at the administrative hearing that the other driver had no possibility of recovery, she would not have been required to make a security deposit. The court held that &sect; 39:6-23, was constitutional because the state was entitled, under its police power, to protect the public against financially irresponsible motorists. The statute required an uninsured motorist that was involved in an accident to deposit security to cover any judgment that could result from the accident, and failure to do so would result in a license suspension.</SPAN></P>

He also alleged error in the trial court's response to jury inquiries as to whether appellant's sentences would be imposed concurrently or consecutively. On appeal, the court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence. The court held that the photographs were properly admitted because they indicated the actual condition of the bodies when found, the entrance points of the gunshot wounds, and the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted and, as such, were clearly relevant. The court held that the lower court judge's response to the jury's inquiries as to appellant's sentences was wholly accurate and could not have caused prejudice to appellant because the judge advised the jury that he could not answer the question and instructed the jury to exclude the subject from their deliberations.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner appealed, and the lower appellate court reversed the portion of the judgment that required a license with respect to work commenced by petitioner after July 1, 1963. The judgment of the appellate division was affirmed. The court held that as N.J. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the decision of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed the trial court's imposition of a sentence of three to five years in state prison and a fine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence of three to five years in state prison and a fine to be worked off while he was confined, after the parole board denied him street parole until he paid the fine, at the rate of $ 5 per day. The court affirmed the decision, finding that the sentence was not excessive, as defendant violated his parole, and the sentence was within the contemplation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:18-47(c)(1). The denial of street parole until the fine was paid at $ 5 per day was justified in light of defendant's history, particularly his work record, his attitude toward regular employment, and his failure to accept the opportunity given to him to satisfy a previous fine by moderate weekly payments. The court found that the parole board concluded defendant would not make a good faith effort to obtain and keep regular employment or to pay his fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of breaking and entering, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:94-1, and larceny, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:119-2. The intermediate appellate court affirmed, and defendant sought review, contending that the search of a codefendant's vehicle violated U.S. Const. amend. IV because it was based on an arrest for the violation of an invalid statute under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-1. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 2A:170-1 was valid. Section 2A:170-1 did not make a suspect's failure to give a good account an element of the offense. Section 2A:170-1 merely allowed a suspect to give a good account in order to dispel an officer's suspicion that he was in a place for an unlawful purpose. Even if &sect; 2A:170-1 were invalid, the officers had other grounds on which to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that interest was appropriate where the economic realities of the situation precluded appellants from improving the land, because the valuation of the property was frozen the day the complaint was filed, precluded leasing, because the tenancy would be precarious, and precluded sale, because the complaint was a substantial cloud on the title, virtually straitjacketing the property, but appellants' tax and mortgage obligations continued unabated, and the land was vacant, unimproved acreage, which produced no income stream to be applied in abatement against interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners filed suit seeking to compel the approval of defendant, Board of Commissioners of the Borough of Deal, of a subdivision map pursuant to the map filing law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:23-9.9. The lawsuit was consolidated with a second suit filed by plaintiffs involving a constitutional attack on a street ordinance amendment and Deal, N.J. Zoning Ordinance &sect; 12a. The trial court held that defendant validly adopted &sect; 12a. The intermediate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed the intermediate court and held that defendant had power over the location and width of streets proposed by plaintiffs and that such power extended to the street in question, despite the fact that they were presently to remain private ways, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:67-1a. The court also held that defendant validly required a minimum distance between parallel streets, that defendant did so by ordinance, that the provision was applicable to plaintiffs' proposed street, and that it justified defendant's refusal to approve plaintiffs' map. The court held that approval power extended to private streets because of the potential for later municipal acquisition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that upheld the denial of plaintiff landowners' subdivision map, because the zoning ordinance providing that no building permit may issue unless the lot had a sufficiently improved means of access for emergency vehicles, in all weather, by public or private street or lane, was valid.</SPAN></P>

The lower court held that defendant was guilty of two counts and sentenced him accordingly. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the conviction, because the provisions of N. J.

Before retrial, defendants moved to dismiss the indictments, alleging that they could only be indicted under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:139-3, which prohibited receiving a stolen automobile. The trial court denied defendants' motions. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of defendants' motions but remanded the cause with instructions to amend the indictment to recite &sect; 2A:139-3 as the statute allegedly violated instead of &sect; 2A:139-1. The court found that legislative history showed that the crime of receiving a stolen automobile knowing it to have been stolen under &sect; 2A:139-3 was a separate and distinct offense from that covered by the general receiving stolen goods statute,&nbsp;&sect; 2A:139-1. However, the court held that the error in the citation of the statute in the indictments was not grounds for dismissal under N.J. Ct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant executors challenged a determination of the transfer inheritance tax bureau (bureau) which assessed transfer inheritance taxes against a 1935, a 1954, and a 1959 trust of decedent settlor. On review, the court affirmed and sustained the assessment on the 1959 trust as a transfer made in contemplation of death pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:34-1(c). The court found that this trust was the substantial equivalent of or substitute for a testate distribution. However, the court found that the 1935 and 1959 trust remainders were not taxable under the after death provision of N.J. Stat. Ann &sect; 54:34-1(c). The court held that no interest under any of the trusts was taxable by virtue of N. J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:34-1d(1) because that section did not create a taxable category in addition to the transfers made in contemplation of death or intended to take effect at or after death covered by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:34-1(c). The court, thus, set aside the assessments made upon the remainder interests of the 1935 trust and the entire corpus of the 1954 trust. The court remanded the case the bureau for further consistent action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the assessment on the 1959 trust as a transfer made in contemplation of death, but the transfer inheritance tax bureau erred in taxing the remainders of the 1935 and 1959 trusts as transfers made to take effect after death and in taxing any interest in the trusts. The court set aside the assessments made on the remainder interest of the 1935 trust and on the entire corpus of the 1954 trust and remanded the matter to the bureau.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was indicted for unlawful possession of heroin, appealed the order of the trial court (New Jersey), which denied his request to suppress evidence on the basis that his arrest was illegal because the warrant was signed by a deputy clerk of the court in contravention of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a complaint of nonsupport made by defendant's wife, a deputy clerk of the municipal court issued an arrest warrant against defendant for violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:100-2. When the officers executed the warrant, heroin was discovered on defendant's person. After he was indicted for possession of heroin, defendant moved to suppress the evidence on the basis that the arrest warrant issued against him was illegal because it was not issued by a neutral and detached judicial officer. After the trial court denied the motion, the court certified the matter upon the request of the appellate court. In affirming the order, the court recognized the constitutional requirement that a detached and neutral judicial officer was required to make the determination of probable cause necessary for the warrant to issue. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:8-27 specifically allowed the deputy clerk to issue arrest warrants and that N.J. Ct. R. 8:3-2(a)(2) gave any officer authorized by law the power to issue arrest warrants for all indictable offenses other than high misdemeanors. Because this warrant was for such an offense, the deputy clerk had authority to issue it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed a judgment of the probate court that directed distribution of proceeds under a will to Hungarian beneficiaries, as requested by plaintiffs, the beneficiaries' attorneys-in-fact. Defendant state attorney general argued on appeal that the proof did not show that the Hungarian beneficiaries would enjoy the full and undiminished value of their shares, and that the proceeds should thus be held by the court under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3A:25-10. The court affirmed because plaintiffs established that the beneficiaries would have the use, benefit, and control of their shares. The court held that &sect; 3A:25-10 was valid only to the extent that proceeds were withheld when delivery was prohibited by the federal government or where it was clear that the beneficiaries' receipt or use was forbidden or made impossible by the law of their country. The burden of proof rested on the party seeking the withholding. The rate of exchange of dollars for local currency was not an appropriate consideration. The court modified the order to direct immediate distribution in a single payment, rather than payment in two installments. The attorney fee arrangement was reasonable in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, defendants, who were either sentenced to death or were facing death penalties (New Jersey), argued that the statutes which related to the death penalty, including N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:113-3 and 2A:113-4, were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated appeals related to capital punishment so it could consider whether New Jersey's capital punishment statutes were invalid under either U.S. Const. amend. V or VI. A federal statute violated U.S. Const. amend. VI when it prohibited a death sentence if a defendant gave up his right to trial by jury; however, the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:113-4 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI because it required a trial by jury. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:113-3 prohibited the death penalty if a defendant pled non vult, which the court held may have affected the U.S. Const. amend. V right to defend. The court held the statutes differed as the trial court retained discretion whether to accept a plea of non vult under &sect; 2A:113-3. The court held that as any impact by &sect; 2A:113-3 upon U.S. Const. amend. V was not needless, it did not violate that provision. The court noted that all defendants would be subject to the death penalty if the U.S. Supreme Court later decided that &sect; 2A:113-3 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the death penalty statute, which allowed a defendant to escape capital punishment through a non vult plea, but which required a trial, were not unconstitutional. The New Jersey statute differed from an invalid federal statute in that the New Jersey trial court retained discretion whether to accept a plea of non vult.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that sustained the constitutionality of the law because the furtherance of higher education was a proper public purpose and the urgency of the need for the expansion of the existing facilities was clear. The court held that there was no danger that public funds would be diverted to private profit making.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of murder in the first degree and were sentenced to death. They appealed to the court and after full consideration, the court held that their guilt was firmly established in a fair trial free from prejudicial error, apart from a single error that bore not on guilt but on the death sentences alone. At oral argument, the state took the position that, rather than a reversal and full retrial because of the sentencing error, the murder convictions should be modified so that defendants would stand convicted of murder in the first degree with life imprisonment. However, defendants asserted that the court lacked the power to modify and that complete retrial was necessary. The state filed a supplemental brief recommending that the findings of guilt be permitted to stand and the matter be remanded for a trial limited to the sole issue of penalty. The court held that a new trial on punishment alone would not have been appropriate. The court concluded that its authority was sufficient to modify a discretionary sentence whenever the interests of justice so required, and thus, the court ordered that defendants' sentences be modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the appellate division affirmed the chancery division's order requiring the attorney general to withdraw his request to the telephone company to discontinue services to plaintiffs, the attorney general appealed. The court reversed holding that the record was sufficient to demonstrate that the telephones were essentials of illegal gambling enterprises. Because the attorney general had probable cause to seize the telephones pursuant to a lawfully issued search warrant, it also had the authority to direct, instead, that the service to the telephones be disconnected. Further, the procedure did not deprive plaintiffs' of due process of law because plaintiffs received the protections incident to prior search warrants and later judicial review. And finally, the circumstantial evidence before the chancery division furnished an adequate basis for the belief that the telephones were part of the bookmaking and lottery setups. Therefore, plaintiffs' application should have been denied and the grant of preliminary injunctive relief was beyond discretionary bounds.</SPAN></P>

The borough sought a declaration that the state commissioner of education and the board acted in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:8-17(3) and sought a readjustment to the apportionment of taxes between the borough and respondent township. It argued that it had been assessed more than its share of taxes for the support of the regional school system and that the township had been assessed less than its share. The board countered that the borough failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court ruled that administrative remedies ordinarily must be exhausted before resorting to the courts but that exceptions were permitted in the interest of justice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent landowner applied for approval of his plan to subdivide his property. While the application was pending, appellant City adopted an ordinance placing that land on its Official Map and designating it for use as a park. The ordinance stopped any attempt to develop the designated land for one year. Respondent's subdivision plan was later granted approval. He was also notified that his land had been reserved for parkland acquisition and would act at his own peril in developing the land during the one-year wait period. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the Official Map Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-1.32 and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55-1.38, claiming that he could not be denied the right to develop his land for one year without compensation. The lower court found the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed finding that where the Act failed to provide for payment for the City's taking, such compensation could be inferred from the statute because, in construing the statute, it could be presumed that the legislature acted with constitutional law in mind and intended the act to function in a constitutional manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant teachers' union presented a list of demands to the board of education, threatening a work stoppage unless the proposals were met. Defendants teachers and union leaders met and discussed a strike; 400 teachers failed to report to work, and picket lines were established. Because the strike was illegal, a restraining order was issued. The order was read to and served upon defendants. Defendants expressed a refusal to comply, and stayed out of work two more days. Defendants were convicted of contempt and sentenced to fines and jail terms, some suspended with probation. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences, holding that the restraining order was not vague but plain in its restraints. The evidence amply supported the findings of guilt. The court held defendants were not entitled to a jury trial, and that the restraining order was not unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIII, because defendants could quit at any time. The court held that the appointment of the board of education's attorney as the prosecutor was subject to the trial court's discretion. R.R. 4:87-4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division of Taxation held the corporation business tax, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-1, et seq., validly applicable to appellant motor freight trucking companies. Appellants denied that appellee Director, Division of Taxation might constitutionally impose the tax upon them for conducting an exclusively interstate business in the state, involving, however, substantial local activities and property. On appeal, the court held that the New Jersey corporate business tax, by reason of the alternative bases set forth in the statute, was not imposed upon foreign corporations merely or solely for the privilege of doing interstate business in New Jersey. The tax was validly applicable to appellants on the foundation of these other bases. The first was that the tax was expressly in lieu of all other state, county or local taxation upon or measured by intangible personal property of a foreign corporation. The tax was additionally sustainable as a levy for the privilege of employing or owning capital or property, or maintaining an office, in the state, if not also for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchise, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-2. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decisions below that the corporation business tax applied to appellant motor freight trucking companies. The privileges afforded appellants were sufficiently different from that of &quot;doing&quot; interstate business so that they were aspects of such business subject to the state's sovereign power. Appellants' localized activities were substantial and they received significant benefits from the state government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the murder. The state sought to compel defendant to submit to a voice recording and a blood test. After the trial court granted both requests, defendant appealed, claiming it violated due process and his privilege against self-incrimination. The court affirmed as to the blood test, reversed on the voice test, and remanded the case. The motion for the blood test was supported by an affidavit showing a likelihood that relevant evidence might be discovered. The order gave the utmost precaution and consideration to defendant's right to privacy and to be free of unreasonable intrusion. Thus, it did not shock the conscience that defendant, under stringently limited conditions and safeguards, must submit to a blood test that could produce objective facts bearing on his guilt or innocence. The court found a remand necessary to consider defendant's due process claim that he could not be forced to talk against his will.

Appellants challenged that determination, but their challenge was rebuffed. The board had the necessary authority under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48:2-23, 48:2-25. The board properly relied on testimony before it, as well as earlier investigations into railroad accidents found to have been caused by human, electrical, or mechanical failures, or by the failure of safety devices to produce expected results. The board was not required to accept appellants' allegations that the flagging requirements did not enhance safety. There was not, as appellants claimed, a lack of substantial evidence or an abuse of administrative discretion. Thus, the court found no sound basis for differing with the board's findings on the need to reinstate certain flagging requirements. Moreover, these particular requirements were not preempted by related federal regulations on railroad safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff voters contended that a statute was invalid because it denied the voter the right to vote for all three defendant county boulevard commissioners in violation of N.J.

Defendants did not question the holding, but challenged the status of plaintiffs to attack the statute, contending the attorney general alone could press a suit to strike down an established municipal body. The court found that a stay should have been granted to permit appellate review. The court noted that defendant county boulevard commission ceased to function because of the trial court's judgment, and its role had been assumed by the county that historically had it. The court found that the question whether defendant county boulevard commission should be permitted to continue notwithstanding the illegality of the voting provision was moot.

Zoning Ord. &sect; 65 (1965) as arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Village of Loch Arbor, N.J., Zoning Ord. &sect; 65 (1965) was amended to prohibit apartment buildings. Plaintiff property owner, who had sought a use permit to build a high-rise apartment house, filed an action to set aside &sect; 65 as arbitrary and capricious. While plaintiff's suit was pending, Village of Loch Arbour, N.J., Zoning Ord. &sect; 66 (1965) was passed, which placed plaintiff's property in a zone where apartment houses were not permitted. The trial court entered judgment for defendant municipal board of trustees, holding that &sect; 66 was not arbitrary or capricious. The appellate court affirmed the decision, indicating that plaintiff had not exhausted its administrative remedy. The court held that plaintiff was not require to exhaust its remedy, as an application to the board of adjustment would have been futile because &sect; 65 was a temporary measure. The court remanded the case, instructing the trial court to make findings regarding plaintiff's contention that the ordinance was arbitrary because it could not put its property to any practical use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee State Board of Education adopted a resolution limiting appellant college's authority to confer bachelor degrees, appellant challenged the decision in the appellate division. Before argument, the court certified the appeal and on review, affirmed the resolution. First, the board's resolution did not violate the right of free speech guaranteed by N.J. Const. art. I, para. VI and U.S. Const. amend. I, because it did not limit in any way what appellant could teach. Appellant's proposition that the constitution guaranteed to everyone an absolute right to confer degrees upon any basis was untenable. Second, the legislature was authorized to delegate to the board the power to make specification for the granting of degrees and thus N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:2-4 did not violate N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 para. 1 and art. III, para. 1. Third, although N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:20-8 exempted certain colleges from the license requirement, appellant failed to show that the classification was invidious and, even if it were, the exemption could be severed. And finally, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:2-4(u) amply authorized the board to give conditional approvals.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs claimed that the licensing provisions for electricians under the statute violated due process and equal protection provisions under both state and federal constitutions. The trial court rejected those contentions and ruled that the statute was valid. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The trial court erred in sustaining the statute based on its inference that the statute included a requirement for supervision and inspection of licensees to ensure public safety. The court failed to find support for the trial court's ruling, but it was reluctant to strike down as unconstitutional a police power enactment of the legislature where there could be available additional factual proof bearing on the matter. Accordingly, the court remanded the case for the presentation of further evidence.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court granted certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the operator of a tavern and restaurant, filed an action against appellant, a municipality, and alleged that appellant's illegal designation of a street as a one-way street constituted a private nuisance, which caused financial loss to respondent in that his business had been reduced by virtue of appellant's action. The lower court dismissed the count, but the intermediate appellate court reversed the lower court's decision. On appellant's application, the court granted certification. In reversing the decision of the intermediate appellate court, the court found that, while appellant's action was procedurally illegal, the establishment of one-way streets was within the proper province of appellant and the procedural requirement for a duly approved ordinance was designed not for the protection of economic business interests, but to advance the interests of safety and uniformity in traffic regulation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from an order upholding the constitutionality of the Congressional District Act, 1966 N.J. Laws 156, as amended by 183, plaintiffs contended that the trial court erred because the redistricting resulted in certain deviations that were unconstitutional pursuant to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The court agreed and reversed and remanded the trial court's order. The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that the districts were improperly constituted because of partisan motivation holding that this contention was beyond judicial condemnation. The court also rejected plaintiffs' contention that some of the deviations, which adhered to county lines, were unconstitutional. However, the court agreed with plaintiffs that there was no justification for the deviations where county lines were broken and the mathematical ideal could be more nearly approached by redeployment of whole municipalities lying at the borders of the districts. The court held that these deviations resulted in a breach of the constitutional command for equality of representation.</SPAN></P>

Appellant unions challenged the propriety of the order. The court affirmed because the order was presumed valid, and appellants failed to show it lacked substantial support on the facts. Respondent balanced the railroad's serious financial difficulties, the relatively meager passenger use, inconvenience to some users, and alternate services. He concluded that the particular trains did not represent passenger service that was essential in the public interest. The legislature intended respondent to have authority to grant leave to railroads with passenger carriage contracts with the state to discontinue trains no longer necessary to the public interest.

The trial court sustained the contracts, and plaintiff sought review. The court affirmed, finding that the contracts were authorized by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48:12A-17-:12A-20 and N.J. Stat.

Defendants appealed. The court held that intent as to the effective date of exemption was to be inferred, from the fundamentals of New Jersey's property tax and local government finance system. There was nothing in present legislation or case law interpreting it which indicated a legislative intent that tax exemption shall take effect at the moment of acquisition. On the contrary, the court was convinced that the tax and local finance structure intended that liability should remain for the balance of the tax year regardless of whether the acquisition was by conveyance or condemnation, but that it should not be imposed upon the former owner. The court affirmed, with the modification that the declaratory aspect thereof should not extend beyond liability for taxes for the remainder of the year of acquisition.</SPAN></P>

Respondent approved the plans, recognizing appellant's conditional prior and continuing right to divert 20 million gallons per day under a prior grant of diversion. Respondent directed that appellant should pay, along with other users, its proportionate share of the costs of constructing and maintaining the new reservoirs. Appellant contended that any charge by in the prior agreement was illegal because the consent and approval was a grant of a franchise by the state in which appellant had a vested interest. As such, any charge was an unconstitutional violation of due process and an unconstitutional impairment of contract rights. The court found that no constitutional issue existed in the case.

While a provision of a statute that relates to local government that prescribes disparate treatment of the subject matter as between municipalities covered thereby without good reason is invalid as special legislation, a distinction is perfectly good where it is grounded in an appropriate classification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners challenged two judgments of the superior court (New Jersey), which upheld the constitutionality of Borough of Beach Haven, N.J. Ordinance No. 62-10 (fence ordinance) and Borough of Beach Haven, N.J. Ordinance No. 63-4 (dune ordinance). On consolidated appeal, plaintiffs contended that the fence ordinance was not a reasonable exercise of police power and that the dune ordinance constituted a taking of their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On consolidated appeal, plaintiff landowners contended that defendant borough's fence ordinance, Borough of Beach Haven, N.J. Ordinance No. 62-10, and defendant's dune ordinance, Borough of Beach Haven, N.J. Ordinance No. 63-4, were unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's orders. Defendant's fence ordinance was not unconstitutional because it permitted plaintiffs to erect a fence subject to the condition that it not impede beach protection work. The fence ordinance was a reasonable exercise of police power for the protection of public health and safety, especially in light of the fact that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:92-9 authorized defendant to protect its ocean and beach front. In addition, defendant's dune ordinance did not result in an unconstitutional taking of plaintiffs' land. Plaintiffs failed show that the land could be put to any economic use and the regulation prescribed only such conduct as good husbandry would dictate. Further, both the definitions and the standards of the dune ordinance were sufficiently clear and definite to furnish adequate information as to what was intended and to act as a restraint against arbitrary enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders of the trial court holding that defendant borough's fence ordinance and dune ordinance were constitutional. The fence ordinance was a reasonable exercise of police power for protection of public health and safety and plaintiff landowners failed to establish that the dune ordinance deprived them of any beneficial economic use of their property, and thus it did not result in a taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted in the Mercer County (New Jersey) Court of disorderly conduct under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:170-28 and 2A:170-29 after they had to be physically removed from a city council meeting. They challenged their convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for disorderly conduct at a city council meeting. It rejected one defendant's argument that his conviction under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-28 was against the weight of the evidence because he was totally passive, noting that defendant had resisted removal both in locking arms with another and in confronting officers with his dead weight. It held that the statute did not apply only to conduct in schools, churches, libraries, and reading rooms, noting that it had been revised in 1952 specifically to expand its application to any place of assembly. It rejected his arguments that his arrest was unconstitutional and that the statute was void for vagueness. It found no merit to the claim of all six defendants that their convictions under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-29 for obstructing or interfering with persons lawfully in a public place were against the weight of the evidence, writing that the obstruction under the statute did not have to be total. Rather, it held, it was enough that defendants immobilized themselves at a place designed for passage, with the purpose of making it difficult for others to go in and out of the council chamber.</SPAN></P>

Laws 193 and 1964 N.J. Laws 194 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint seeking a declaration that 1964 N.J. Laws 193 and 1964 N.J. Laws 194 were unconstitutional, and a restraint against the acceptance of bids. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and entered a final judgment in favor of defendants. On review, plaintiff contended that, although the statutes in question dealt only with purchases of milk by the state itself, its agencies and political subdivisions, they nonetheless provided for an unconstitutional restraint of interstate commerce. The court was not inclined to strike the statutes as violative of the Commerce Clause on their face. Nor was the court prepared to say that the statutes were to be upheld without regard to any showing as to their effect on interstate commerce. The court concluded that the record was not sufficiently complete to permit any fair determination as to whether interstate commerce was being unduly burdened. Accordingly, the judgment was modified and the cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief from the judgment of conviction of the trial court (New Jersey), in an action involving a second degree murder conviction, prosecutorial comment and the judge's charge regarding defendant's failure to testify, the self-incrimination protection of U.S. Const. amend. V., and defendant's opportunity to speak at sentencing under R.R. 3:7-10(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant did not take the stand; comment on this failure to testify was made by the prosecutor in summation and in the judge's charge. On sentence day, defendant's counsel urged many factors in mitigation, but the judge pronounced sentence without inquiring from defendant personally. On direct appeal, these issues were not challenged. No further review was sought until more than nine years later; defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, asserting the retroactive application of the new rule that such prosecutorial comment and instructions were forbidden by the self-incrimination protection of U.S. Const. amend. V. He also asserted that he was not afforded the opportunity to speak at sentencing, in violation of court rules. The state's motion to dismiss the petition was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the first rule need not be applied under certain conditions, including where direct appeal had been exhausted. The other violation was not a valid ground for post-conviction relief, but could be raised only on direct appeal, a motion in the trial court, or within 60 days after judgment; the sentence was not &quot;illegal&quot; under court rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, because the new rule, which stated that it was a constitutional violation to comment on defendant's failure to testify, did not need to be applied where the judgment had been rendered, the direct appeal had been sought, or the petition for certiorari to the supreme court had been finally denied or elapsed by a certain date. Failure to allow defendant the chance to speak at sentencing could not be raised by collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents sought reinstatement of their children in the respondent Board of Education's schools. The children were excluded because they refused to pledge allegiance to the United States flag. Petitioners testified that they believed in the Islam religion and that its followers were taught that their sole allegiance was to Allah. They were further taught that the flag was but a symbol, and that it would be contrary to their teachings to pledge allegiance to any flag, including the flag of Islam. They contended that their refusal to permit their children to pledge allegiance to the flag fell within the exemptions provided in N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18:14-80, for their children had conscientious scruples against such pledge. Respondent argued that the exemption for conscientious scruples was never intended to be so broadly construed as to include petitioners' religious beliefs. The court found that the question was whether petitioners could invoke conscientious scruples as their reason for claiming exemption from the pledge of allegiance. The court held that petitioners could do so.</SPAN></P>

The county court (New Jersey) denied relief and defendant challenged the propriety of the denial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court denied defendant's request for vacation or reversal of a conviction of first degree murder resulting in a life sentence. On appeal, defendant contended that his purported confession was involuntary and the product of coercion by law enforcement officers. He further contended that for appellate review of that question a transcript of the testimony was not only essential to him, but was required by court rules and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:152-17, 18. The transcript was neither ordered nor furnished by defendant because of indigency and the court reporter's notes had been destroyed. The court held that the absence and the consequent impossibility of preparing a transcript did not reflect adversely on defendant's claim. His attorneys had filed a notice of appeal and took active steps to perfect the appeal by applying for a free transcript. Judicial refusal of that relief constituted invidious discrimination, and was an unconstitutional deprivation of his right of appeal under the due process and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court reversed the judgment below, vacated the conviction, and remanded the cause for a new trial on the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of defendant's request for the vacation or reversal of his conviction of first degree murder, because defendant's right of appeal was denied him by judicial action. The impossibility of obtaining a transcript of the testimony completely frustrated any form of nunc pro tunc appeal or other review of the proceedings at that trial, thus the court vacated the conviction and remanded for a new trial on the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation and respondent tax director sought review of an order from the lower court (New Jersey), which upheld the levy on the net worth aspect upon a finding that appellant's world-wide business was unitary for that purpose under the Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-1 et seq., but then held that respondent could not include in the income measure appellant's receipts from the foreign subsidiaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court held that appellant corporation and its foreign subsidiaries did constitute a unitary enterprise warranting respondent tax director's inclusion of the total net worth in the tax base under the Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J.

The appellate court found that appellant had failed to establish that there was no functional relationship and &quot;unity of use&quot; between the foreign subsidiaries and itself, so as to militate against the inclusion of appellant's net worth in the subject tax base. The appellate court then noted that respondent's reliance upon the concept that the subsidiaries' net income could not be reasonably attributable to New Jersey was misplaced and accordingly reversed the portion of the order that excluded appellant's receipts from those foreign subsidiaries from the income tax base. The appellate court also reversed the denial of adjustment of the allocation factor and remanded the matter for further proceedings, concluding that respondent not only had the authority but also the obligation to consider requests for adjustment on claims of unfairness which did not attain constitutional dimensions.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 54:29A-1 et seq., &quot;main stem&quot; property was Class I property, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:29A-11, and taxes were paid to the state. Other, Class II property, taxed at a higher rate, was paid to local government. Respondent railroad argued that its main stem included trackage in a terminal yard, a railroad pier, and equipment used to dump coal into barges. Appellant township argued that main stem included only tracks where the through route stopped and ended at the terminal yard throat. This court found that the legislative history was of little help and that there were few relevant reported cases. The court held that there was logic in the main stem being stopped at the terminal throat but because the view contradicted past practical administration, the court held that the main stem included only trackage within the yard to a maximum width of 100 feet where trains came to a stop and respondent Division of Tax Appeals' order was thus modified. The case was remanded for a finding of whether appellant was prejudiced by use of an erroneous valuation standard because respondent railroad was required to prove true value.</SPAN></P>

Respondent municipality levied taxes on appellant's leasehold interests in the property under the Leasehold Taxing Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-2.3 et seq. The assessments were upheld by the Division of Tax Appeals. Appellant sought review, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional because it discriminated against the federal government. The court held that the interests of private parties in property owned by the federal government could be taxed as private parties benefited from local government services. The court found that the statute was not discriminatory on its face. The statute authorized taxation of all exempt property when the property was leased for private use, and applied to state owned property as well as federal property. The exclusions contained in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-2.12 did not discriminate against the federal government and could be severed if used in a discriminatory manner.

The legislature had authority to vest the power to authorize the discontinuance of trains in the commissioner even though the principal power to deal with railroads was placed in another department; certain problems could be more effectively dealt with by the commissioner. The statute contained standards by which the commissioner was governed when read in light of other provisions which required him to hold hearings.

Defendant alleged that the restraint was violative of due process and the New Jersey Anti-Injunction Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:15-51 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bi-state agency was created by a compact entered into between New Jersey and Delaware for the purpose of constructing and operating bridges and a ferry service between the two states. Employees were restrained from striking the ferry service in its demand for higher wages and recognition of defendant union. On appeal, the court held that as plaintiff was a state agency, its activities clearly involved a proper exercise of governmental functions essential to the public. Accordingly, defendant's members were public employees who were denied the right to strike under N.J. Const. art. 1, para. 8. Under the compact terms, plaintiff was empowered to commence its suit against defendant as an agent or subdivision of the states. The court declined to infer from the compact provisions that plaintiff was subject to collective bargaining. The New Jersey Anti-Injunction Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:15-51 et seq., was inapplicable as this was a dispute between a government agency and government employees. Since a strike by plaintiff's employees would be illegal, picketing in furtherance thereof would not be constitutionally protected free speech and could be properly enjoined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying defendant union's motion to dissolve a temporary restraint was affirmed, because defendant represented public employees who were prohibited under the New Jersey Constitution from striking plaintiff bi-state agency, an instrumentality exercising public and essential governmental functions.</SPAN></P>

No pupils would be transferred to any school where the Negro enrollment was over 50 per cent. The court reversed the judgment and held that the plan was not pointed towards the goal of greatest dispersal in the school system as a whole and did nothing helpful towards meeting the racial imbalance at schools that had a higher Negro population per cent. By approving the plan without more, the Commissioner was misled by unduly restrictive views as to the scope of his own functions in reviewing and supervising local actions, and as to his own responsibilities in the correction of substantial racial imbalance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions in the trial court (New Jersey), following a joint trial in which one defendant was found guilty of second-degree murder and the other defendant guilty of manslaughter. They challenged the evidence obtained in a warrantless search and the inadequacy of jury charges on the defense of another, the admissibility of certain statements, and the elements of shared intent and participation by both defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed the victim to death during a fight, allegedly in response to a knife assault upon codefendant by victim. On appeal, the court held that the entry into defendant's apartment without prior oral demand for admission for purpose of arrest was lawful and that the police search conducted incidental to the arrest was equally lawful. Admission of codefendant's accusative statement without adequate and timely instructions to the jury was prejudicial and constituted error. The trial court's failure to give proper limiting instructions in its jury charge which, coupled with the charge as given as to the reliance which should be placed on codefendant's confession, contributed to an unjust result and constituted plain error. The trial judge's failure to charge sua sponte on the essential elements of defendant's right to intervene in defense of codefendant was plain error. Because the jury charge was fatally deficient in failing to instruct the jury as to the essential elements of intent and participation as to the degrees of crime of which each defendant could be found guilty, it had the capacity to mislead the jury and constituted plain error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of conviction were reversed, and the matter was remanded for retrial. The court held that the trial judge's failure to present limiting instructions and a limiting jury charge on the introduction of a confession was plain error. The trial judge's failure to charge on the elements of defense of another and the elements of intent and participation was also plain error.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statement was admissible because defendant was charged with knowingly possessing lottery slips, and the question of how long defendant had been writing numbers was relevant to the issue of whether his possession of the slips was a knowing one.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded not guilty to murder, claiming that he was incompetent to stand trial and that he was insane at the time of the alleged crime. The state sought an order to compel defendant's examination by the state's doctor, to which defendant objected. Defendant then agreed to be examined, provided that disclosure of the report was stayed. He appealed the order compelling the examination. The court affirmed the order. The court rejected defendant's claim that the order violated his constitutional rights, finding sufficient safeguards against self-incrimination. The safeguards included the requirement that if it appeared that defendant's statements about the crime to the state's doctors were relevant to their opinions as to his capacity to commit the crime, or to stand trial, they would be admissible, but only on the issue of sanity; that they were not substantive evidence of guilt; that the jury was to be immediately so instructed; and that upon failure to cooperate, defendant could be temporarily committed to an institution for observation.

On appeal, the lower court reversed the prior determination and found the ordinance, which had been amended, to be entirely valid. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, holding that in the light of the peculiar geographical situation of respondent municipality and its long settled land use development, the use classification was adequately sustained on the basis of the traffic and safety problems. The court decided the merits of the appeal, although it found there was no absolute right of appeal, because the dimensions of causes involving a question arising under the New Jersey Constitution had previously not been fully clear.

The state challenged a subsequent order reversing the conviction on the basis that the evidence against defendant was obtained by an unlawful search. On appeal, the primary question was whether defendant voluntarily gave his consent to the search of his apartment. The court concluded that the court below erred in holding that the trial judge's findings were plainly unwarranted by the facts before him. The circumstances of the case, the fact that consent was given while in the back seat of the police car, while the officers were in the front; the fact that defendant let the officers into the apartment with his key, was sufficient to justify the trial judge's finding that the consent was voluntary. With respect to defendant's issue with voice demonstration evidence, the court concluded that voice identification as in this case was non-testimonial in character and therefore the privilege against self-incrimination was inapplicable. The judgment below was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor's warning to defendants that their refusal to answer questions might subject them to dismissal was a type of compulsion which could be legitimately used, as such discharge was predicated upon defendants' failure to cooperate in a situation where their police duty compelled cooperation. Failure to advise defendants of their right to counsel did not render their statements involuntary, as the absence of advice was not a significant factor in obtaining their statements, and defendants were aware of their rights as officers.

The court reversed and remanded, holding that the statute exceeded legislative power to prescribe qualifications because it took the issue of fitness for office from voters, and it violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it was an unreasonable restraint on the right to vote. The court found that registration was not rationally related to the need to assure that a candidate had a basic understanding of local conditions because appellant candidate could still demonstrate that understanding, but by law he could not comply with the statute. Thus, appellant candidate was beyond the reason for the statute. Further, the depth of that understanding was an issue for voters to decide.

Appellant had its principal place of business in Virginia, was authorized to do business in New Jersey, and had a registered agent in New Jersey. The lower court held that respondent's right to the dividends remained valid in spite of the favorable stockholder vote on the recapitalization plan and the formal order of approval of the amendment of appellant's certificate of incorporation by the Virginia State Corporation Commission, under which appellant argued the plan was authorized. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed respondent's complaint. The court held that there had been no authoritative decisions by the Virginia courts on the issue and they were given deference. The court held that Virginia was a more convenient forum because appellant had relatively little contact with New Jersey, and the judgment would not be binding on preferred stockholders of other states who were not parties to the proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought review of the denial of their applications for post-conviction relief and their motions to stay execution, following their convictions for robbery-murder. The court held that defendants' admissions came before the indictments, and their statements identifying the gun used had little importance in the trial and did not taint the reliability of the jury's determination of their guilt. Hence, retroactive application of a rule that prohibited the admission of evidence taken in violation of defendants' rights to counsel and their rights to remain silent was unwarranted. The trial judge did not err when he did not get counsels' consent to his decision not to sequester the jury over the weekend because weekend newspaper articles did not mention the case or impair defendants' fundamental rights to a fair trial. It was not plain error for the trial court to exclude death penalty opponents from the jury because the state had the right to have its case considered by jurors who would abide by the law. Defendants made no offer to the trial judge to plead non vult, and hence had no standing to raise that point on appeal. The failure to bifurcate the trial was not plain error.</SPAN></P>

It was not error for the court to refuse to sequester the jury or for the trial court to exclude jurors against the death penalty. It was not plain error to not bifurcate the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found defendants guilty of murder in the first degree and the trial court sentenced them to death. On consideration of the trial court's denial of defendants' fifth application for post-conviction relief, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendants' allegations that prior to and at the time they confessed, they were subjected to physical and mental coercion and held incommunicado, because the court previously found their stories unbelievable. As to defendants allegations for the first time that they asked for and were denied an opportunity to consult with an attorney and were not advised of their right to remain silent, the court found that it had already ruled that the confessions were voluntary, and held that the decision in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S. Ct. 1758, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977 (1964) did not have retroactive effect. Defendants' convictions were obtained as a result of a procedure not considered fundamentally unfair at that time, and subsequent judicial decisions cast no substantial doubts upon the reliability of the determination already made, and so no compelling reason existed for disturbing a decision no longer subject to direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of first-degree murder, due in part to testimony of co-indictees, who had pleaded non vult, and later recanted. Defendants were denied a new trial, and appealed. The court held that limits on defendants' examination of the co-indictees were not prejudicial; rejected untimely claims as to involuntariness of a confession; upheld the denial of acquittal motions; and upheld the convictions. The court agreed that the co-indictees' recantations were fabricated; rejected error as to jury questions about non vult pleas; found no error in the jury's non-sequestration; and held that the state's failure to disclose a grand jury transcript did not merit reversal. The court rejected a constitutional claim relating to alleged discrepancies between penalties imposed after convictions on non vult or not guilty pleas, because defendant had not tried to enter such a plea, and thus could not raise the issue. While the lower court's refusal to recuse itself was proper, it was error to refuse to let counsel examine notes to which a witness referred during the new trial motion hearing, and the matter was remanded for production of the notes and assessment of their effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment convicting defendants for first degree murder and denying their motions for a new trial were affirmed despite a post-trial recanting of inculpatory testimony by two co-indictees, because the lower court correctly deemed the new testimony a fabrication. However, the lower court erred in refusing to order the production to defendants of notes used by a witness in the post-trial proceedings, and that issue was therefore remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed the judgment upholding the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Division awarding respondent widow dependency benefits upon the death of appellant's employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent, who fell from a ladder at work and suffered injury, filed for workmen's compensation and was found totally and permanently disabled. After his death from severe emotional upset, respondent widow filed her dependency claim. At a hearing before the workmen's compensation division, appellant employer and respondent submitted conflicting medical testimony on the causal relationship between decedent's accident and death. The division found for respondent and determined that the applicable compensation rates were those in force under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:15-13 at the time of the decedent's death, and appellant sought review. The county court affirmed, and, on appeal, so did the appellate court. Appellant's petition for certification was granted. The court affirmed, as nothing warranted disturbance of the appellate court's judgment. The court concluded that it was not required to make new findings of fact where the appellate court's decision was unanimous. The court found that respondent's right to dependency benefits accrued on decedent's death, and the rates in effect on that date applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant corporation challenged a judgment from the Superior Court (New Jersey), which denied defendant's motion for relief after judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff state government in an action for custodial escheat of unclaimed dividends, interest, wages and other cash obligations in the possession of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state government sought custodial escheat of unclaimed dividends, interest, wages and other cash obligations in the possession of defendant corporation. After defendant consented to entry of partial judgment, the trial court directed defendant to pay plaintiff and retained jurisdiction over the action. When the United States Supreme Court reversed a state's judgment of escheat, defendant filed a motion seeking to be relieved of the escheat judgment. Defendant's motion was denied. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had personal jurisdiction, because there was due service of process on the defendant. Jurisdiction of the subject matter was present, because the trial court had power to determine cases of the class to which plaintiff's action belonged. The court determined that when defendant chose not to appeal from the judgment, it deliberately subjected itself to the binding effects of res judicata. Plaintiff's claims were superior to defendant's claims, and the trial court was within its discretionary authority when it denied defendant's motion. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
